Adidas is the manufacturer of this ball (& btw this ball is made in Sialkot – Pakistan which manufactures 70% of the footballs used in the world). The ball has been designed with a suspended IMU (inertial measurement unit) inside its bladder which allows the referee to have instantaneous highly detailed ball movement aiding his/her decision-making.

Let me take you on an Al Rihla FIFA World Cup 2022 in Doha Qatar.

I boarded the Qatar Airways flight to Doha from Bangalore on early Dec 2nd morning and landed at 5.45 am at Doha. The aircraft in flight was full of FIFA 2022 messages though I slept through wanting to arrive fresh in Doha. Ours was amongst the first flights to arrive at the Hamaad International Airport and we were greeted by the huge posters of superstar Neymar and others.

Anticipation expectation and the smile of having landed finally to witness my first FIFA World Cup games said it all. Had planned our travel in March 2022 as soon as FIFA announced the opening of their ticket sales and it was a long wait to arrive. However I was happy to finally arrive.

Highly advanced contactless automated immigration took me hardly a couple of minutes and I was done with that formality. Had planned an airport pick up from my hotel and I instantly got a call from our captain guiding me to meet me at the FIFA Welcome desk.

It was clear that we were gonna have a time of our life. Though what lay ahead was exponentially higher than our expectations.

We drove into our hotel and were soon into our room on the 22nd floor. We were in the financial district and next to the corniche with high rises surrounding us and the view of the marina from in between the high rises. I was in Doha after almost 19 years and Doha was beyond recognition for me.

Not to be stuck in our rooms we were soon out exploring the city checking on the vibes. Entry to Qatar was through a “Hayya card” (digital card by downloading the Hayya App). The Hayya card was the e-Visa as well as the ticket for all the public transport in Qatar (Metro Trams and Buses).

Down the hotel we walked to the closest metro station which was just a block down.

FIFA World Cup air surrounded us and wrapped us in its big endless fabric. I could smell the “Al Rihla” whizz past me like a Ronaldo free kick beating all defenders into the Goal Post.

A panoramic shot of the Doha’s CBD area where we were put up with the metro station to the left and a FIFA Ticketing Centre to resolve any disputes for visiting fans was just outside that. All signboards and directions clearly laid out it was as if someone had thought through every minute detail to dish up a lifetime experience of joy & delight and celebration.

We caught the red line to Musheireb – Doha hardly 3 stops away. Free wifi-enabled Metro with friendly support staff and ushers guided us in and out. The Metro was of the highest quality and we bumped into fans from all around.

We were visiting Souq Waqif. The Souq is a traditional marketplace in Doha selling local spices handicrafts garments souvenirs etc. With the wide variety of restaurants I was told this was the place to be to soak in the World Cup atmosphere. When planned the Souq was water facing allowing boats and traders to dock and come in to sell the wares. Modernisation & World Cup gave it a new look and feel still creating its traditional charm and pull.

Colourful tram glided through the souq almost allowing you to jump out & jump in as it allowed your hyper-excited heart to rest and catch up and soak in the easy-paced life outside. Light traditional music wafted through the air and we were transported into the “wonderland” of World Cup 2022.

Soccer fans from across the globe proudly sporting their national jerseys and flags walked & talked animatedly.

Brazilian fans were noticeable from afar in their bright yellow colours as they walked confidently.

Cameroon fans were colourful as always.

Pictures videos youtube captures reels and documentaries were being shot all around. Everyone was capturing the experience around and sharing with family near & dear ones and of course the followers.

FIFA World CUP is a commercial event and commerce had to be seen and felt all around as youtubers and media guys were interviewing fans and seeking opinions and responses while the cooler fans ignored all and soaked it all in even indulging in music and dance.

The Uruguayans were enjoying and Mexican fans in their Sombreros were loving the attention they got.

Rival fans mixed with each other and bonhomie could be felt all around.

Food options galore made it difficult to choose from – Mexican Lebanese Turkish Iraqui French English Spanish you name it and the Souq offered it (sadly did not notice any Indian option – we first have to qualify for no.… I rationalised to myself).

There was a FIFA zone with Messi and Neymar proudly displayed (both from PSG which the Qatar Royal family owns) it of course had Diego Maradona statue too in his Argentine jersey. A must-have pic for fans from any country any continent.

Then of course the original and traditional Souq was there with innumerable local items to buy and carry back home.

Highly colourful and extremely attractive with ever-smiling shopkeepers wanting to converse and share their experiences with you talking excitedly about how Saudi Arabia beat Argentina also how Morocco is the dark horse of the tournament.

This Souq was a place to trade your knowledge your emotions and wash your sorrows and trade it for happiness.

The souq of happiness the souq of colours the souq of expectations the souq to just sink in and let the FIFA Work Cup 2022 envelope you.

It was the “Majlis” (sitting room) of the Global World to come to Qatar and forget the challenges the world had faced and still continues to face and just enjoy the journey.

“Al Rihla” had just begun for me and my sons – Ruchin & Rohan.

Am sure you have enjoyed this journey so far. Will bring to you in a few episodes my journey of 6 days to bring you a ringside view of what you won’t get to see or know from your usual sources.

Al Rihla brings to you the FIFA World Cup 2022 right from Doha – Qatar.

FAQs About Water Heater

What is the normal life expectancy of a water heater?

About 10 years. What are the signs your hot water heater is going out?

Any time rust deposits or a metallic odor coming out with hot water can signal either rusty pipes or rust inside the water heater. If corrosion is eating away the metal from the inside leaks are inevitable. Murky water from the tap can also be signs that the water heater will fail soon. What is the most common problem with water heaters?

Water leaks are perhaps the most common type of water heater issue you'll face. Any water heater will start to leak eventually as by nature water will eventually corrode your tank and create microscopic cracks or fractures.

As part of the program interdisciplinary teams from the program partners will be tailored for supporting each startup and they will provide the startups with the tools and business skills needed to accelerate the process of bringing innovation to patients and the key players in global health systems.

The BeyondBio SCALE program was launched last July with a published call for action for relevant startups to apply to the program. Dozens of startup companies submitted applications. Out of all applicants six Israeli startups were selected to join the program which is expected to last until July 2023.

Pangea Biomed - improving the personalization of cancer treatments

ENLIGHT the platform developed by the company uses machine learning and the analysis of information from the RNA of cancerous tumors with the aim of matching each patient with the most accurate safe and effective program for them. The system predicts the response of more than a hundred known drugs on dozens of different tumor types - and has already shown successful results in the treatment of patients who would not have received personalized treatment without it.

Curesponse - a next generation personalized oncology drug scoring and prioritization platform

Curesponse's cResponse platform combines rapid next generation genetic sequencing (NGS) with an AI enabled functional test: a proprietary lab assay originally developed at the Weizmann Institute that maintains tissue samples viable for over a week while preserving functional tumor microenvironment (TME). This combination enables cResponse to offer patients oncologists and pharma partners an empirical test that simultaneously scores up to 10 different drugs/drug combinations efficacy on an individual tumor within 2 weeks across the full therapeutic modality spectrum (e.g. chemo targeted biologics Immunotherapy).

Quris.ai – artificial intelligence for predicting the degree of safety of various medicines

Drug safety is a major unaddressed problem. A staggering 89% of all drugs fail in clinical trials despite ’successfully’ passing animal testing costing pharma companies over $53B each year.

Quris has developed a Bio-AI prediction platform which tests drug's safety in a three-tiered process: Generate>Train>Predict. First Quris Generates millions of interactions between known drugs and patients-on-chip (miniaturized interconnected human organs on a chip). Then Quris Trains the AI based on the proprietary auto-labelled nano-sensor data extracted from these interactions. Last Quris' platform can accurately predict the safety and personalization of new drug candidates. Quris has a pilot collaboration agreement with Merck and is looking to for additional cooperation opportunities

QuantHealth – clinical trial simulation for drug development optimization

The company's solution enables pharma and biotech companies to execute thousands of clinical trials within minutes and to find the optimal protocol for the investigational drug. The artificial intelligence platform created by the company crosses over a trillion data points from various sources in the medical and pharmaceutical worlds including data of 350M patients and 700K drugs and molecules. The platform predicts patient response to drugs that they may have never received. In this way QuantHealth holistically simulates clinical trials in a virtual form to solve the $45B problem of failed clinical trials at its source.

Rhino Health - Accelerating Healthcare AI Using Privacy Preserving Compute

The concept by Accenture Song the agency that crafted and executed the campaign was inspired by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hotel and travel industries. “There are countless things we’ve all lost over the past few years as a result of not travelling. The ability to connect with people in meaningful ways to be spontaneously romantic or inspired by new cultures to be the things we like most about ourselves. Our sense of self may be out of practice but that doesn’t mean it’s gone” Accenture Song said.

In his address Donovan White director of tourism said among other things “We know that destination Jamaica is second to none. However the impact of the pandemic resulted in us losing something after being locked down for so long. It is now time to get back what we lost. And what better way to do so than in Jamaica …? We are inviting the world to come back to feeling their best selves again in Jamaica.”

Under the tag line ‘Come back to the vibe that comes alive in Jamaica’ the JTB is inviting people to come back to “adventure” “loving” “relaxed” “chill” “curious” and “excited” “not just to all the wonderful places you can go in Jamaica but to the long-lost places our guests can discover within themselves”. “The fact is Jamaica is and has always been the destination that has helped its visitors live up to their most valuable human potential” Accenture Song also said.

Accenture Song was represented by Managing Director Wendy Glass who explained the concept and what inspired it and Executive Creative Director Keith Ross who walked the audience through different elements of the campaign after which there was a screening of the clips from which feel-good Jamaican music complemented the mood in the room.

The agency collaborated with Jon Baker of Portland’s Geejam Studios to create an original soundtrack to support the visuals. Accenture said “Music producers Troy Baker and Dale Virgo put a modern twist on classic music influences including ska dub reggae and dancehall to capture the essence of Jamaica.” Another original element is the hand-painted display font called ‘Curious’ designed to “uniquely complement our photography with the personality and charm of Jamaica”.

Three main categories of visitors are targetted: the experience seekers who are “exploring Jamaica discovering romance and adventure while making a connection to Jamaican culture”; the young family “who is experiencing their long-anticipated family vacation”; and the seasoned travellers “an older target whose experiences have unlocked their appetite for adventure their curiosity about the local culture and their lasting love for each other”.

The campaign was filmed in 31 scenes using over 35 local crew members in 12 locations from St Ann to Portland in five days. Ten principal actors and 23 local extras were the talents. “Our goal was to capture the island’s natural attractions and its lovely people working in concert to help visitors live their best lives. Working with Jamaica’s incredible production talent was imperative to bring that vision to life” Accenture Song explained.

The people factor was crucial to the message of the campaign which Minister of Tourism Edmund Bartlett spoke of to the gathering of tourism stakeholders partners and associates. The people are a major part of the uniqueness of our tourism products and “it is that uniqueness of the experience that we are calling our customer value proposition. And Jamaica intends to create a customer value proposition that is superior … that is inimitable that no one else can replicate”.

“And that is why we are not looking to be competitive in the traditional sense but to be comparative and being comparative means that we can get a value response that nobody else and we are seeing a bit of it in terms of the recovery and how our product has been seen in the marketplace … in relation to other products that are around” the tourism minister said. He also said revenue up to December is “going to pretty much equate” the revenue of 2019 year to date “but in terms of the fiscal year we are going to be $500 million more than we were in 2019.”

Value proposition then Bartlett intimated are more than sea sun and sand which is all over the Caribbean. It has to come from “somewhere deeper and more intrinsic” from deep within us “a special piece of us” the people of Jamaica. “So what it is saying is that the value proposition that Jamaica is offering to the market is sufficient attractive and alluring that they are prepared to pay more” Bartlett said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXctdXBkYXRlcy9iZW5nYWx1cnUtdG8tZmFjZS1wb3dlci1vdXRhZ2Utb24tZGVjZW1iZXItMTctMTgtY2hlY2stcmVnaW9ucy1hZmZlY3RlZC10aW1lLXNsb3RzLWhlcmUvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTYyOTg0MTQuY21z0gGhAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ldy11cGRhdGVzL2JlbmdhbHVydS10by1mYWNlLXBvd2VyLW91dGFnZS1vbi1kZWNlbWJlci0xNy0xOC1jaGVjay1yZWdpb25zLWFmZmVjdGVkLXRpbWUtc2xvdHMtaGVyZS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTYyOTg0MTQuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bengaluru to face power outage on December 17 & 18.

The digital rupee is a central bank digital currency issued by the RBI. It is similar to the physical cash that you hold in your wallet except that the e-rupee is held electronically in a digital wallet overseen by the RBI.

The digital rupee is recognised as legal tender by the RBI and thus has to be accepted by everyone in the country as a medium of exchange.

It is however different from deposits that you hold in a bank. Unlike deposits which are paid interest the digital rupees in your wallet are not paid any interest by the central bank. Deposits held in banks can be converted into digital rupees and vice-versa.

Why India Needs a Digital Currency?

According to the RBI the digital rupee system will “support India’s digital economy improve financial inclusion and improve the effectiveness of the monetary and payment systems.”

Leveraging blockchain technology for the e-rupee is a stepping stone for India to become a $1 trillion digital economy say experts. India is witnessing massive growth in digital transactions — the volume and value of UPI transactions increased by 118 per cent and more than 98 per cent respectively in Q2 2022 compared to Q2 2021.

Further experts opine that the digital rupee rollout is a big step ahead in India’s digital transformation. It will be an excellent opportunity for India since it will potentially increase the ease of doing business as well as improve resilience and security of the entire payments infrastructure.

Finally the biggest factor is there will be no longer geographical limits with the internationalization of current and financial account transactions. “A Digital Rupee that can be held by non-residents and is available to conduct cross-border financial transactions seems a natural extension to enable new retail payment possibilities and business ventures” said Pranav Arora Managing Director and Lead of Applied Intelligence Accenture in India.

He further said: “The launch of the Digital Rupee in India is expected to usher in more efficiency transparency systemic resilience and governance in our currency management system.”

RBI’s e-rupee/CBDC VS Crypto Currency And UPI

The difference between CBDCs and cryptocurrency is simple – the former is backed by a central bank or a sovereign nation while the latter is considered like private money that is not backed by any sovereign entity. However there is not much difference in terms of payments as in both CBDC and crypto payment settlement happens instantaneously.

As far as UPI transactions are concerned the settlement of transactions happens on the backend between two banks. However with both CBDC and crypto the settlements happen instantaneously as money is programmable.

While RBI is all set to roll out CBDC in full scale especially the retail e-rupee many are still skeptic about the move due to the associated risks.

Risks Associated with CBDCs

Since CBDC is a form of digital currency one of the most common risks associated with this form of e-rupee is data privacy and financial stability. Experts believe that many countries have not launched CBDC till now even after researching on it as privacy and cyber security are big concerns.

It is also understood that CBDCs have the ability to accumulate sensitive user and payment data as it is still a part of the web. If the data ever goes in the wrong hands it can easily be used to spy on private transactions secure sensitive details and also indulge in cyber crimes. Hence it is believed that the implementation of security protocols is a must to mitigate risks while rolling out CBDCs.

Is the Digital Currency Future of Money?

As the future of commerce is a cashless one experts are anticipating the digital rupees will stand out in the future’s needs. Digital currency will always have a lifeline because it cannot be physically lost or damaged. The hazards of Bitcoin volatility will be reduced.

The e-rupee will also reduce the operating costs associated with producing distributing and storing banknotes. The e-rupee can be extremely helpful in preserving the environment because it will lessen the need for paper.

ADBE,Adobe,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZnN0b3BwZXJzLmNvbS9zb2Z0d2FyZS93aGF0LWFyZS1iZXN0LWFsdGVybmF0aXZlcy1hZG9iZS1waG90b2dyYXBoZXItcGxhbi02MjIxMzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Are the Best Alternatives to the Adobe Photographer Plan?,"Adobe ruled the waves for image processing. However evermore people are jumping that ship in favor of alternative methods. Most have similar functions and each has its advantages and disadvantages. If you are thinking about changing here are some alternative combined digital asset management photo development and editing options.

This article is a brief introduction to the various programs out there. When choosing what you need there is a balance to be achieved between cost and functionality. All these packages include DAM (digital asset management) and raw development. Not all include advanced image editing although most raw developers have some degree of local adjustments and simple tools like spot removal and graduated filters. Some features are common to many programs but not all: HDR processing panorama stitching focus stacking sky replacement watermarking and time-lapse creation. Some come with integrated AI-based noise control and sharpening. Others rely on external plugins to do those functions.

I am also writing this for desktop (or laptop) editors. Consequently I only concentrate on computer-based programs and not comparing the cloud services that some offer nor the phone and tablet apps.

I'll mention the unique selling points of each but this isn't an in-depth review. If you want a DAM program they all work. If you want raw development then they all do that too. Some allow advanced image editing while others require you to open a different program. The workflow of each is unique too. Therefore making direct comparisons is difficult.

Similarly because they use different raw engines each gives distinct looks to the photos it processes. Also these programs handle individual brands' camera raw files differently; a program that works well and offers excellent results for me and my camera might not cut the mustard for you and yours. Only you can decide whether the workflow and the resulting look are right for you.

Performance is also a difficult thing to judge. That's because you will hear anecdotal evidence about any program that runs slowly on someone's computer. For example if I open Lightroom Classic at the same time as Firefox my computer grinds to a halt. Both programs otherwise run happily and not everyone experiences this glitch. One of my colleagues has speed issues with Capture One and someone commented on my recent review of ON1 that they had problems with that whereas I don't have issues with either. With the complexity of these programs combined with the vast number of variations in our computers and the programs loaded on them someone will inevitably experience glitches and shout about it in the comments. You may or may not share the same issues.

The important message here is to check the program has the features you need and download the free trial to ensure it works for you before spending your money.

Comparing costs is very difficult. Firstly several manufacturers offer two or three levels of functionality at different prices. Some require an external program to edit the images which adds to the cost. Some have bundled extras when you buy from them. Then it's usually cheaper to upgrade from a previous version than buy a program for the first time. This seems odd to me because you would think the manufacturers would be dropping the initial price to entice new customers. Furthermore there are perpetual licenses where you effectively buy the program and subscriptions where you rent it.

The order in which these are presented does not correspond with any recommendation scale.

Adobe Photography Plan

Adobe's Creative Cloud Photography Plan is still considered the industry standard. Between the programs included in the plan — Photoshop Lightroom and Lightroom classic— it does most things a photographer might want to do. A wide range of plugins are available for Photoshop to give it the functions it lacks and Lightroom catalog is the standard by which others are measured.

Although it is not the most expensive option at just under $120 per year there are far more cost-effective options.

Adobe Lightroom Classic

Photoshop's entire gamut of facilities is far greater than any photographer needs. After all it is aimed at graphic artists architects and graphic design professionals not just photographers. Consequently it is a complex and sometimes complicated program that takes time to learn. There are things that other programs do better such as sharpening and noise reduction and there are external programs and plugins that can be used to cover those —buying those adds to the cost of course.

Photoshop Elements

There is a cut-down version of Photoshop: Photoshop Elements. It comes with its Organizer a very simplified catalog tool. It started as a good introduction to manually controlled image development and editing and has evolved into an automated tool for those who want to short-cut that process. Its emphasis is now on single-click filters and adjustments that add and remove elements from a photo. However manual adjustments are possible and these can be guided for those learning editing skills.

Although it has many automaed features making it easy for beginners to use some advanced features like layers are available although these are limited in comparison to Photoshop.

It's still popular with those who create scrapbook layouts but for accomplished photographers its limitations including its reduced raw development feature might be a step too far. However it has some interesting features such as animating part of a still image.

Unlike the Photographers' Plan which is subscription-only Photoshop Elements can be bought outright. But at $99.99 for a program upgraded yearly you are losing a lot for less than $20.

PhaseOne Capture One Pro

Capture One's USP is its outstanding raw results and many think its color rendering is superior to anything else. Its tethering capabilities for studio use are strong too supporting a more comprehensive range of cameras than Adobe's offerings. However it is comparatively expensive; it has recently introduced a subscription package that costs more than the Adobe Photographer Plan. Furthermore it doesn't include a fully featured editor. Nevertheless many top photographers use it because of the image quality. A perpetual license is $299 and its recently introduced annual subscription is $179 or $24 per month.

Capture One includes DAM. Professionals who use it rely on an external editor to carry out tasks that are impossible with the raw file.

DxO PhotoLab 6

DxO PhotoLab 6 is another highly praised DAM and photo-processing package. Its users like the results. It claims its USPs include image quality and especially its optical corrections. It also uses DeepPRIME denoising technology which has a well-earned excellent reputation. PhotoLabs claims innovative creative tools intuitive local adjustments and powerful digital asset management.

DXO Photolabs 6.

The Elite Edition is only available as a perpetual license with no subscription at $219. There's a cheaper cut-back Essential Edition. More details of this software are available here.

ON1 Photo Raw 2023

ON1 Photo Raw is probably the best-featured package I am mentioning here. It has its extensive editing suite—called Effects—integrated into the same program as its DAM and raw development tools so there is no time-wasting jumping back and forth from one program to another. It comes with AI noise reduction sharpening and image resizing. Furthermore if you are migrating away from Adobe it is possible to import the catalog and an approximation of the LR C adjustments into it. The basic raw development sliders will seem familiar to LR users.

One powerful feature of ON1 is its integrated NoNoise AI.

On1 Photo Raw is far more accessible than other programs I have mentioned. Adjustments can be achieved either with a single click preset or by manually using more complex adjustment layers which are easier to understand than adjustment layers in Photoshop so it suits image developers of all levels. Plus the raw development results are superb.

Its specialties include portrait retouching noise reduction sharpening and image resizing but there is much more to it than that.

On1 Photo Raw 2023 is available with a perpetual license and a subscription. Some of the functions are also available as plugins for other programs.

At the time of writing ON1 Photo Raw 2023 was discounted from $99.99 to $74.99 for the perpetual license. There are two subscription packages with extra facilities from $89.99 to $179.99 per year. My recent review of it is here.

ACDSee Ultimate 2023

ACDSee Ultimate 2023 is a versatile no-nonsense tool. Like ON1 it allows you to import your Lightroom Database. It's also fast and the workflow is smooth. It lacks some of the advanced features of ON1. There isn't AI noise reduction for example but it is possible to add external editors like ON1 No Noise or Topaz Denoise. However its AI-based facial adjustments are a good choice for portrait photographers. There are cut-down cheaper versions of the software but the Photo Studio Ultimate starts from $89 per year or a one-off payment of $149.99 discounted to $109.99 until December the 21st 2022.

Coral AfterShot Pro 3 and Paintshop Pro 2023

Like jumping from Lightroom to Photoshop one has to switch between two programs as it is a combination that gives you DAM in Aftershot Pro and powerful one-click editing tools in Paintshop Pro. It comes with a very basic raw converter but for more precise raw adjustments you will need to buy Coral Aftershot.

Coral's raw converter that is included with Paint Shop Pro is very basic.

Its big claim is that it is four times faster than Lightroom. It is another file management system with a library. It works with Linux too which not many others do.

Paintshop Pro's automated adjustments work well.

At the time of writing Paintshop Pro Ultimate was discounted from $99.99 to $79.99. AfterShot Pro is also discounted from $79.99 to $47.99

On a Tight Budget? There Are Free Options

Lightzone is worth considering as a Lightroom alternative if you are on a tight budget. Sadly the website has been taken down but the latest version is available on GitHub.

When coupled with an external editor such as the free GIMP or Paint.net then it's worth considering.

Users of Photoshop will find GIMP familiar.

Many photographers cut their editing teeth on GIMP which is free. For Windows users the excellent and free Paint won the Microsoft Store App Awards in 2022.

Similarly DarkTable is another free open-source photography workflow and raw development application.

A Quick Word About Affinity Photo 2

Although not a DAM program it would be remiss of me not to mention Affinity Photo 2. It has recently been launched. Many photographers I know have ditched Photoshop in favor of this feature-packed editor. I reviewed it here recently. It is discounted until January 25th 2023 from $69.99 to $40.99.

My Conclusions About the Different Programs

Although I said this is not a review of the programs having downloaded and tried them all to write this article I have formed an initial opinion although I haven't tested them all to destruction.

If like me you rarely do more than process raw images for image quality both Capture One and DxO PhotoLab 6 share first place. I'd heard many good things about both but hadn't tested them and it surprised me how good they were. I could quickly get better results from them than using Photoshop.



The downside is the price tag. They don't have fully-featured editors; if that is what you need then buying Affinity is an excellent complement to them

The most bang for your buck comes from ON1 Photo Raw. The array of tools available and the results are superb plus the price is reasonable. It does everything I need as a photographer and swiftly switches between modules. It also can be used by everyone from the novice to the expert.

As I said at the start these are subjective viewpoints and you might find that a different program works better for you. Any of these programs might suit you depending on your priorities. Some will want to stick with Adobe because of the vast number of tutorials while others will find the workflow of ACDSee suits their needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYW50YWZlbmV3bWV4aWNhbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbF9uZXdzL3BpbmstYWRvYmUtdG8tYmUtc29sZC10by1vd25lcnMtb2YtbmVpZ2hib3JpbmctaW5uLW9mLXRoZS1maXZlLWdyYWNlcy9hcnRpY2xlXzhkN2QyMzBhLTdjYjYtMTFlZC1iNmI1LWVmMjBlYzk1ZGY1Yy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pink Adobe to be sold to owners of neighboring Inn of the Five Graces,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Pricing for Ryzen 7000 non-X CPUs has now been confirmed.

The rumors about potential Ryzen 7000 pricing were indeed correct. Slides from the embargoed presentation shows the pricing and specs for the upcoming Ryzen 7000 series which are set to launch next year. Those CPUs are the so-called 7000 non-X series operating with a base TDP of 65W.

AMD Ryzen 7000 non-X Specifications and Pricing Source: VideoCardz

AMD is preparing three SKUs: Ryzen 9 7900 Ryzen 7 7 7700 and Ryzen 5 7600. Starting with Ryzen 9 7900 this is a new 12-core CPU featuring boost clock up to 5.4 GHz. The base clock is reportedly 3.7 GHz which means exactly 1.0 GHz lower than 7900X. According to the slide this CPU would cost $429 and it would compete with Intel Core i9-13900 and i9-12900 CPUs. What is important to note is that the former is not released yet.

The 8-core Ryzen 7 7700 non-X has a base clock of 3.8 GHz and boost of 5.3 GHz. That’s 700 MHz lower base and just 100 MHz lower maximum frequency compared to the 7700X model. This processor would compete with Core i7-13700 and i7-12700K from Intel with a price tag of $329.

Finally the 6-core Ryzen 5 7600 non-X gets a boost clock up to 5.1 GHz and 3.8 GHz base (0.9 GHz slower than 7600X). This CPU would sell at $229 and it would compete with Core i5-13600 and i5-12600 processors.

AMD Ryzen 7000 non-X Specifications and Pricing Source: VideoCardz

Since AM4 coolers are officially compatible with the new AM5 socket existing coolers designed and sold by AMD are compatible with the new Ryzen 7000 series as well. The 65W CPUs will be bundled with the said coolers which are called Wraith Prism and Wraith Stealth. The former will be added to Ryzen 9 7900 and Ryzen 7 7700 CPUs while the latter will be bundled with Ryzen 5 7600.

Given the recent price cut for Ryzen 7000 series it may be very hard for AMD to sell these non-X SKUs at those suggested prices. It looks like for just $20-30 more gamers can choose 170/105W models instead.

The full embargo on Ryzen 7000 non-X series lifts on January 9th which should be either the review date or actual launch date. However AMD will announce these CPUs at CES 2023 conference a few days sooner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9lbG9uLW11c2stdGVsbHMtYWRhbS1zY2hpZmYtMDYzNzQzNjYyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk Tells Adam Schiff His Brain Is 'Too Small' In Juvenile Attack Tweet,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9lbG9uLW11c2stdGVsbHMtYWRhbS1zY2hpZmYtMDYzNzQzNjYyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D8039C3D0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Then only a few hours later she uploaded another photo from the photoshoot this time truly fully transforming into a Barbie doll. She posted the photo with the caption “My latest magazine cover with @vulkanmag is now available for purchase! 🎀 Visit the link in my bio to get your copy and tag me once it arrives! 💕 #linkinbio @ryan_jerome.”

In this photo we’re seriously losing it over how much Electra looks like a Barbie doll as she stands in a vintage Barbie box with the retro nostalgic font saying “Carmen” instead of Barbie. And in this photo we see her rocking another hot-pink look of a high-slit silk skirt and matching sparkling blazer.

Seriously pink is Electra’s color and we can only imagine how she’s going to celebrate the release of the Barbie movie next summer!

In the interview with Vulkan Electra opened up about everything from her favorite project to how much she loves the color pink. When asked if she’d like to see the world in pink she said “Absolutely pink is sexy! It is cute but depending on how you wear it It can be demanding too and I feel like we achieved that with this shoot. Anytime you wear pink it becomes such a moment.”

She added in another part of the interview she talked about how she’s focusing on her lucrative OnlyFans side hustle. “I’m exploring the world of OnlyFans. I made it to the top 1 [percent] which I’m grateful for. The freedom I have is exciting” she said. “I shoot with my friends when we’re just hanging out at my place and it’s such a fun project. To the Vulkaners be confident in your body and passionate about everything you do!”

Their advertisements show guests of varying ethnic backgrounds gathering happily in sunny houses seeming to feel at home — or even better on vacation.

But some people of color — particularly Black guests — say that despite the policies and partnerships that home-sharing platforms have put into place they still face discrimination when booking or staying in vacation rentals. They are frustrated by what they say is a lack of understanding and accountability.

In a report released on Tuesday Airbnb acknowledged the issues and provided the first public data on the steps it has taken to reduce racial disparities including removing some human factors from the booking process.

Laura Murphy a civil rights expert who has directed the Washington legislative office for the American Civil Liberties Union and is now a senior adviser to Airbnb wrote the introduction to the report. It reveals some of what has been learned from Project Lighthouse an effort that was publicly started in 2020 by Airbnb and Color of Change an online anti‌discrimination group to use internal company data to measure patterns of discrimination.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY291cGxlLXdpdGgtMjAtYWlyYm5icy1xdWl0dGluZy1mb3ItbW9yZS1kaXJlY3QtYm9va2luZ3MtMjAyMi0xMtIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY291cGxlLXdpdGgtMjAtYWlyYm5icy1xdWl0dGluZy1mb3ItbW9yZS1kaXJlY3QtYm9va2luZ3MtMjAyMi0xMj9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A couple with 22 active Airbnbs says they plan to leave the platform,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXhzdGFyLW1lZGlhLXdpcmUvaG93LXRoZS1haXJibmItZ29sZC1ydXNoLWNvdWxkLWltcGFjdC10aGUtaG9tZWJ1eWluZy1tYXJrZXQv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9rdGxhLmNvbS9uZXdzL25leHN0YXItbWVkaWEtd2lyZS9ob3ctdGhlLWFpcmJuYi1nb2xkLXJ1c2gtY291bGQtaW1wYWN0LXRoZS1ob21lYnV5aW5nLW1hcmtldC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the Airbnb ‘Gold Rush’ could impact the homebuying market,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://ktla.com/news/nexstar-media-wire/how-the-airbnb-gold-rush-could-impact-the-homebuying-market/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXhzdGFyLW1lZGlhLXdpcmUvaG93LXRoZS1haXJibmItZ29sZC1ydXNoLWNvdWxkLWltcGFjdC10aGUtaG9tZWJ1eWluZy1tYXJrZXQv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9rdGxhLmNvbS9uZXdzL25leHN0YXItbWVkaWEtd2lyZS9ob3ctdGhlLWFpcmJuYi1nb2xkLXJ1c2gtY291bGQtaW1wYWN0LXRoZS1ob21lYnV5aW5nLW1hcmtldC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlYXVtb250ZW50ZXJwcmlzZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL0xha2UtQWlyYm5iLXJlbnRhbC13aXRoLXJvb3RzLXRvLVRlamFuby1sZWdlbmQtMTc2NTEwMDgucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South Texas Airbnb rental has ties to Tejano musician Freddy Fender,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/Lake-Airbnb-rental-with-roots-to-Tejano-legend-17651008.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlYXVtb250ZW50ZXJwcmlzZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL0xha2UtQWlyYm5iLXJlbnRhbC13aXRoLXJvb3RzLXRvLVRlamFuby1sZWdlbmQtMTc2NTEwMDgucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5haXJibmIuY29tL3N1cHBvcnRpbmctdGhlLXNoaW5lLWEtbGlnaHQtY2FtcGFpZ24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supporting the Shine A Light campaign,"With acts of antisemitism at historic levels it is more important than ever to speak out.

WWE.com

With WWE having already taped next week's episode of SmackDown Raquel Rodriguez is the new #1 contender for the SmackDown Women's Championship currently held by Ronda Rousey.

It was previously announced how this upcoming blue brand offering - which was taped from Chicago's Allstate Arena directly after last Friday's SmackDown - would see a six-woman gauntlet match to crown a new challenger for the Rowdy One and spoilers for Smackers come from Twitter user Miguel960 and NoDQ.com.

Billed as Raquel Rodriguez vs. Liv Morgan vs. Tegan Nox vs. Emma vs. Sonya Deville vs. Xia Li this bout started off by having the recently returned Li beat both Emma and Nox. From there Rodriguez entered the match and went through Xia Morgan and Deville to win the contest... ish.

In a twist after Sonya was eliminated Shayna Baszler came out as a surprise entrant in this gauntlet effort. Despite having already had to battle through three other competitors Raquel managed to get the better of the Queen of Spades and earn herself a shot at Ronda Rousey.

Many had predicted that Raquel Rodriguez would be next up to challenge for Rousey's SmackDown Women's Championship with Ronda and Baszler having attacked and injured Raquel's arm several times over these past few weeks.

Google has acquired KoruLab to boost Wear OS on this front.

When Wear OS 3 was announced in May of 2021 Google said it worked with Samsung “to optimize the lower layers of the operating system – taking advantage of low-power hardware cores to enable better battery life.”

“Handy optimizations” were credited as allowing the heart rate sensor to run “continuously during the day track your sleep overnight and still have battery for the next day.” This manifested with the Pixel Watch (and its coprocessor) being able to measure your heart rate every second which Fitbit was proud of.

Google is now furthering this with the acquisition of KoruLab in December (via Mobiili.fi) with 30 employees in Finland joining the Wear OS team.

Today’s announcement strengthens Google’s commitment to Finland and takes our Wear OS platform forward with the help of Koru’s unique low-power user interface expertise. Google

This Finish company developed Koru a “declarative Graphical UI Framework providing design freedom even on a limited microcontroller based hardware.”

The library is only 128 kB and it has wide operating Kernel support from RTOS to Linux. It renders 60 fps graphics on Cortex M4 based microcontrollers.

Features include:

“The system is incredibly efficient taking only 128 kB of RAM and able to sleep 98% of the time while updating a clock every second.”

“Energy efficiency is one of our cornerstones. We can do a full powerup-update screen-sleep cycle in 20 ms. We can boot system from off in 500 ms. With Koru a week of battery life is attainable.”

“Koru is built on top of open standards like HTML XML CSS and JavaScript.”

“Wide OS Kernel support: RTOS ANDROID NetBSD Linux. Wide graphics engine support OpenGL ES Open VG Framebuffer. Full native integration with ST Microelectronics Chrom-ART 2D hardware accelerator.”

Social media stocks have been decimated this year with Snap down 80% and over $600 billion of Meta's market cap wiped out.

Considering the economic climate this shouldn't be too surprising. Social media companies generate most of their revenue from selling ad space and investors are worried that a potential recession could result in reduced ad spend over the next few years.

Only time will tell if this is true but there's one social media company that is positioned to not just weather a potential recession but possibly come out much stronger.

The thesis for Pinterest

While the image sharing platform Pinterest (PINS -1.52%) has at times traded in tandem with other social media companies it offers a very different experience from its so-called competitors.

""Pinners"" as its users are called flock to the platform for inspiration whether it be interior design fashion or even Christmas gifts. This makes advertising on the platform much more effective as promoted content is complementary to the experience rather than a distraction such as on Meta's Instagram or Facebook.

In my opinion Pinterest is closer to a search engine than a social media company. And search is an inherently more profitable industry as seen in Alphabet's third-quarter operating margins of 32% versus Meta's 20%.

This e-commerce-centric experience is one of the many reasons Pinterest has outperformed other social platforms and is likely to continue to do so in the future.

The metrics that matter

When considering an investment you should determine the important metrics to the underlying business. For Pinterest that's monthly average users (MAUs) and annual revenue per user (ARPU).

MAUs have been a point of criticism for Pinterest in the past year. After peaking in 2021 monthly users began to decline and in turn the market sold off the stock.

But as of the company's most recent quarterly report MAUs are once again on the rise which could be evidence that the decline was simply a short-term by-product of the pandemic pull forward. Investors and sideline spectators alike should watch this metric closely in the coming quarters. But for now it appears Pinterest is once again in growth mode.

The other highly important metric for Pinterest is its annual revenue per user (ARPU) which measures the revenue it produces from each Pinner. The company generates an impressive ARPU of $5.84 domestically and a global ARPU of $1.54.

But what has me most interested is Pinterest's ARPU growth which was 15% year over year. For context Meta's ARPU fell by 6% according to its third-quarter report.

In a time when companies are cutting their ad spend this ARPU growth tells us there's something unique about Pinterest that keeps advertisers spending on the platform.

Pinterest's new search-centric CEO

Earlier this year Pinterest underwent a transition in the corner office. While the departure of a founding CEO in a rising growth company isn't usually a good thing in Pinterest's case it seems to be a highly logical move.

Former CEO and co-founder Ben Silbermann transitioned to executive chairman and handed the keys over to Bill Ready who was previously the president of Commerce Payments & Next Billion Users at none other than Alphabet's Google the largest search engine in the world.

I believe this points to a leadership team that understands Pinterest's potential to operate more like a search engine and less like a social platform.

Silbermann who remains highly involved with Pinterest's operations shared his thoughts on the transition during the company's second-quarter earnings call:

In our next chapter we are focused on helping Pinners buy try and act on all the great ideas they see. Bill is a great leader for this transition. He is a builder who deeply understands commerce and payments. And he shares our passion for creating a positive corner of the Internet.

Pinterest is an advertiser's dream

Pinterest will never have the user base of social media giants like Meta but that's not the point. The company has outperformed both Meta and Snap by a wide margin this year because e-commerce is ingrained into the experience of pinning.

People are using the platform specifically for inspiration to make a purchase which makes advertising highly effective. This is easily seen in the company's rising ARPU as opposed to declines among its peers.

And now that the monthly users are once again on the rise Pinterest looks like an excellent risk-adjusted investment.",,,,,,
GOOG,Alphabet Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzE4L2FscGhhYmV0LW93bnMtdGhlc2UtdGhyZWUtc29mdHdhcmUtc3RvY2tzLXNob3VsZC15L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alphabet Owns These 3 Software Stocks. Should You?,"See what's in the tech giant's $2 billion investment portfolio.

Alphabet (GOOG -0.75%) (GOOGL -0.77%) may be best known as the parent company of Google as well as YouTube Google Cloud and the autonomous driving start-up Waymo. But in addition to those businesses Alphabet has also become a prolific investor in both publicly traded stocks and privately held start-ups. Its investment portfolio is worth nearly $2 billion and consists of 49 stocks primarily across tech and healthcare.

Not surprisingly there are several software stocks in its holdings. Here are three software-as-a-service stocks the tech giant owns that look like attractive buys today.

1. GitLab: A DevOps disruptor

GitLab (GTLB -0.08%) provides a cloud-based platform for DevOps giving developers and IT personnel the tools they need to efficiently create and deploy software.

The company went public last October and while the stock has fallen in the tech sell-off this year its growth numbers have been impressive. Revenue jumped 69% to $113 million and though the company is still operating at a loss its margins are improving and GitLab now expects to be breakeven on a free-cash-flow basis by 2024.

Alphabet invested in GitLab when it was still a privately held company increasing its stake in GitLab after it lost out in a bidding war for rival GitHub which was acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion in 2018. Alphabet initially invested $20 million in GitLab in 2017 and participated in a $100 million investing round the following year. GitLab also received an investment from Intel Alibaba and Nasdaq. Today Alphabet owns 593000 shares in GitLab worth around $30 million.

GitLab is in something of a duopoly with GitHub as both companies offer a replacement for individual point solutions in DevOps. GitLab is growing fast into an addressable market valued at $40 billion giving the stock a lot of upside potential.

2. Amplitude: Paving the way in digital optimization

Amplitude (AMPL -1.51%) which went public last year as well specializes in product data analytics software. The company helps businesses measure and understand how customers use their digital products. It helped Peloton recognize that social interaction was key to a positive user experience and Burger King used it to guide its Whopper Detour campaign which offered a Whopper for a penny to anyone who downloaded the Burger King app near a McDonald's. The company says that digital optimization is the next step after digital transformation and demand is growing as companies recognize the need for it.

Amplitude's revenue rose 35% in its most recent quarter to $61.6 million and its current remaining performance obligations or its backlog over the next year jumped 46% to $183.9 million.

Amplitude actually considers Google Analytics to be one of its biggest competitors though Google Analytics has traditionally been focusing on marketing data rather than product data. Despite that competition Alphabet still owns a small stake with 189000 shares worth roughly $2.9 million.

As more companies go down the digital optimization path Amplitude looks set to be a leader in the burgeoning sector.

3. Snowflake: Dominating data warehousing

Since it went public in 2020 Snowflake (SNOW 0.82%) has been one of the fastest-growing companies in software. It has seen huge demand for its data warehousing services which allow companies to store process and analyze their data.

In the third quarter Snowflake's revenue jumped 67% to $522.8 million and it had a net revenue retention rate of 165% showing that existing customers increased their spending by 65% over the last four quarters.

Snowflake uses a consumption model which makes it easy for customers to spend more as Snowflake charges them based on the compute and storage resources they use per day. The model makes it easy for Snowflake to grow revenue as it doesn't have to upsell its customers or add seat licenses to expand relationships.

Alphabet owns 535000 shares valued at roughly $91 million and it's not the only high-profile investor in Snowflake. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares though Buffett's deputies have been credited with that purchase.

Like the rest of the tech sector Snowflake is down sharply having fallen 58% year to date. But that could set up a buying opportunity given the company's rapid growth and its large customer base.

Like the tech stocks it owns Alphabet stock has also been tripped up by the tech sell-off but all three of these stocks are leaders in their software sectors. When the economy turns around and market sentiment shifts these stocks could be poised to surge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vOXRvNWdvb2dsZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8xNy9nb29nbGUtd2Vhci1vcy1rb3J1bGFiL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google gives Wear OS low-power UI expertise with Koru,"With battery capacity inherently constrained by the size of wearables optimizing the OS that runs on miniature devices is the approach to take.

Barcodes can be hard to find and can be affixed to oddly shaped products something robots can't troubleshoot very well.

As a result Amazon said Friday that it has a plan to kill the barcode.

Using pictures of items in Amazon warehouses to train a computer model the e-commerce giant has developed a camera system that can monitor items flowing one-by-one down conveyor belts to make sure they match their images. Eventually Amazon's AI experts and roboticists want to combine the technology with robots that identify items while picking them up and turning them around.

""Solving this problem so robots can pick up items and process them without needing to find and scan a barcode is fundamental"" said Nontas Antonakos an applied science manager in Amazon's computer vision group in Berlin. ""It will help us get packages to customers more quickly and accurately.""

The system called multi-modal identification isn't going to fully replace barcodes soon. Products in Amazon warehouses will need to have barcodes as long as outside companies that make and ship them rely on the technology to identify and track stock. Amazon's new system is currently in use in facilities in Barcelona Spain and Hamburg Germany the company said adding that it's already speeding up the time it takes to process packages there. The technology will be shared across Amazon's businesses so it's possible you could one day see a version of it at a Whole Foods or another Amazon-owned chain with in-person stores.

Amazon has built computer vision into other products. You can ask an Echo Show smart display ""Alexa what am I holding?"" to get help recognizing objects around the house. The feature is called Show and Tell and was designed with vision impaired people in mind. Smart phone makers and social media companies have also included AI features in camera and photo apps categorizing photos automatically for example.

The problem that the system eliminates -- incorrect items coming down the line to be sent to customers -- doesn't happen too often Amazon says. But even infrequent mistakes add up to significant slowdowns when considering just how many items a single warehouse processes in one day.

Amazon's AI experts had to start by building up a library of images of products something the company hadn't had a reason to create prior to this project. The images themselves as well as data about the products' dimensions fed the earliest versions of the algorithm and the cameras continually capture new images of items to train the model with.

The algorithm's accuracy rate was between 75% and 80% when first used which Amazon considered a promising start. The company says the accuracy is now at 99%. The system faced an initial hiccup when it failed to catch color differences. During a Prime Day promotion the system couldn't distinguish between two different colors of Echo Dots. The only difference between the packages was a small dot that was either blue or gray. With some retooling the identification system can now assign confidence scores to its ratings that only flag items it's very sure are incorrect.

Amazon's AI team says it will be a challenge to fine-tune the multi-modal identification system to assess products that are being handled by people which is why the ultimate goal is to have robots handle them instead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vcmV0YWlsL2FtYXpvbi13YWxtYXJ0LWNvbXBldGl0b24tdGlrLXRvay1zaG9wLWluZmx1ZW5jZS1zbmFwLXBpY3R1cmUtdHJlbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Walmart Roll Out New Ways to Shop,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/retail/amazon-walmart-competiton-tik-tok-shop-influence-snap-picture-trend on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vcmV0YWlsL2FtYXpvbi13YWxtYXJ0LWNvbXBldGl0b24tdGlrLXRvay1zaG9wLWluZmx1ZW5jZS1zbmFwLXBpY3R1cmUtdHJlbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Derek Kerr AA's CFO and president of the airline's regional brand American Eagle confirmed that the airlines will end their flying agreement. According to CNBC Kerr cited AA's concerns about YV's financial and operational issues which are related to rising costs and the industry's pilot shortage.

The Crux of the Problem

The shortage of pilots which is most acute at regional airlines and has gotten worse since travel demand picked up after a pandemic travel slump is the root of the issue. In an effort to recruit and keep pilots YV and other regional airlines have raised pay while AA has increased pay at its regional affiliates.

However the CEO of YV informed staff in the note that AA had declined to pay for higher pilot rates for additional regional partners and that YV had been penalized for failing to fulfill pre-COVID contract obligations actions that cost Mesa around ""US$5 million in losses per month” Ornstein said.

According to a securities filing Mesa had a net loss of about US$67m over the nine months that ended on June 30. The airline delayed the release of its quarterly earnings report last week.

According to Mesa's most recent annual report which was released a year ago approximately 45% of AA and 52% of United were responsible for the company's revenue as of September 30 2021. Mesa flies for DHL as well.

Further Comments from American Mesa Airlines

American's Kerr was quoted as saying ""...we have concerns about Mesa’s ability to be a reliable partner for American going forward” Kerr said in an employee memo. “American and Mesa agree the best way to address these concerns is to wind down our agreement.""

Mesa’s Ornstein told employees in a memo “We are excited to announce we have negotiated a wind-down of our operations with American and are finalizing a new agreement with United which would transition all CRJ900s currently flying for American Eagle to United Express.”

American intends to focus on flying with independent regional carrier SkyWest Airlines (OO) and its wholly-owned regional subsidiaries Envoy and PSA. The final Mesa flight for AA will be on April 3 though AA is slashing Mesa flights in March Kerr said in his note.

Having been flying for more than 65 years Bette’s career has outlasted 12 Presidents but it may soon come the time for AA’s #1 most senior flight attendant to finally hang up her wings.

Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com

After six decades in the business the spritely octogenarian understandably doesn’t do a huge amount of flying nowadays and she’s normally found operating the short hop between her base in Boston and Washington DC.

In fact Bette’s presence on the early morning service is so routine that the flight has been affectionately dubbed the “Nash Dash”.

The roughly one-hour flight is operated on an Airbus A319 – the smallest aircraft in the American Airlines fleet with a capacity for 128 passengers. Bette is understood to be solely trained on AA’s Airbus fleet as she doesn’t operate long-haul flights anymore.

But by the end of 2023 American Airlines will require all of its flight attendants to be trained on all aircraft types in the fleet. As well as Airbus A320 series aircraft American Airlines also operates single-aisle Boeing 737 aircraft along with widebody Boeing 777s and 787 Dreamliners.

In terms of operational resilience this policy change makes sense and compared to many other carriers this isn’t anything new. However it’s been difficult for an airline like American with lots of senior crew who joined the carrier from various mergers and acquisitions to standardise aircraft qualifications.

At long last American Airlines is setting a deadline to change that but as aviation insider JonNYC notes this could “be the end of the road for some extremely senior FAs [flight attendants] if they need to get 777/787 trained.”

AA:

all FAs need to be trained on all aircraft by the end of 2023. — 🇺🇦 JonNYC 🇺🇦 (@xJonNYC) December 13 2022

According to JonNYC crew bases that serve so-called ‘international premium destinations’ will be the first to require all flight attendants to be trained across all aircraft types while non-IPD bases will be required to meet the new standard by the end of 2023.

Along with learning safety and emergency drills for all aircraft types flight attendants will also need to be trained in different inflight service routines.

Of course there’s nothing to stop very senior flight attendants from going through this training but whether they would want to is perhaps another matter altogether.

So will Bette Nash also have to be cross-trained on all aircraft types? Could we see Bette working on long-haul flights again at some point in the future? We reached out to American Airlines but unfortunately their team wasn’t willing to discuss the matter."

View the current offers here.

There is a wide range of hotel options in the Wyndham Rewards program — from budget-friendly hotels like Days Inn and Super 8 through Ramada and Tryp to upscale brands like Wyndham Grand and Registry Collection Hotels. That includes Caesars Rewards locations as well thanks to its partnership with Wyndham.

With so many options to choose from which credit card should you use to pay for a Wyndham Rewards hotel: a Wyndham Rewards card or something else? Here's a closer look.

Comparing credit cards for a Wyndham hotel stay

Aside from using a Wyndham cobranded credit card you might also consider using a good travel rewards card that earns transferable points. Let's look at some common options and what you could get when using these cards.

* Bonus value is an estimated value calculated by TPG and not the card issuer.

The information for the Wyndham Earner Business Wyndham Earner American Express Green and Wyndham Earner Plus cards has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Which card should you use?

In many of life's choices you can't have everything you want at the same time. However with Wyndham hotel stays that's not necessarily true. The most important benefits given to you by having a Wyndham credit card don't require you to actually pay with that credit card to receive the perk.

Related: Which Wyndham Rewards credit card is right for you?

For example if you hold the Wyndham Earner Plus card you'll enjoy benefits like late checkout and room upgrades regardless of what credit card you pay with during your stay. Interestingly this even applies to the ""cardmember discounted rate"" for saving money on hotel bookings. The terms and conditions of this benefit don't require you to pay with a Wyndham card to unlock the cardmember discounted rates. You can enjoy this benefit as long as you are logged in to your associated account when booking online or by providing your account number if booking over the phone.

You'll also enjoy other benefits with Wyndham Rewards regardless of which card you use to settle your final bill. This includes earning bonus points associated with your elite status tier. Members earn 10 points per dollar and elite members can earn 10% 15% or 20% extra points depending on their status. This isn't contingent on paying with a Wyndham credit card. You also don't need to pay with a Wyndham credit card to take advantage of the reduced rate on Go Free (free night awards) redemptions; this benefit allows cardholders to use 10% fewer points on award stays.

Furthermore you can enjoy a unique benefit of Wyndham Rewards: rollover nights. Here's how this works: You need nine nights per year to qualify for Platinum status and 24 nights to qualify for Diamond. If you stay 15 nights with Wyndham this year you have six nights more than you needed for Platinum but not enough to reach Diamond status. Those extra nights will roll over into next year to give you a head start. And this benefit is available regardless of how you pay for your stays throughout the year.

Since these benefits will apply regardless of how you pay the question becomes what type of points and how many of them you want to earn.

Do you want to earn an 8.8% return on spending (according to TPG's valuations) but have points that can only be used in one way (i.e. with Wyndham Rewards)? This is your path if you pay with the Wyndham Earner Business card. Or would you prefer to earn a 5.4% return on spending with the Citi Premier Card (see rates and fees) and have options for how to use your points including transferring them to Wyndham for hotel redemptions?

It's also worth pointing out that you can earn more rewards by booking through the Chase portal or Capital One portal. However you will likely forgo your status perks and benefits since these are considered third-party bookings.

Bottom line

There are many hotel credit cards and numerous other travel rewards credit cards that you could use to pay for an upcoming hotel stay at a Wyndham property. Whether you're staying at the most expensive or most affordable hotel in the Wyndham Rewards program the way you earn points and the perks available to you won't change. Thus the decision hinges on the type of points you want to earn — Wyndham Rewards points or transferable points — and the value you assign to them.

The expulsion of Salah Hammouri underscored the fragile status of Palestinians in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem where most hold revocable residency rights but are not Israeli citizens. It also worsened a brewing diplomatic spat with France which had repeatedly appealed to Israel not to carry out the expulsion.

“I’m happy to announce that justice was served today and the terrorist Salah Hammouri was deported from Israel” Israel’s interior minister Ayelet Shaked announced in a videotaped statement early Sunday. The expulsion capped months of legal wrangling.

Hammouri who was born in Jerusalem but holds French citizenship landed in Paris just before 10 a.m. local time. Wearing a black track suit and black and white keffiyeh or Palestinian headscarf around his neck he was greeted by his wife and a group of supporters.

Some hugged him and others clapped in support.

Speaking to reporters Hammouri accused Israel of “ethnic cleansing” and said his deportation was meant “to show the generations that nobody can resist Israel.” He vowed to fight the order.

“I will continue my right to resist against this occupation until I have the right to go back to my country” he said.

Israel says Hammouri is an activist in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine a group that it has labeled a terrorist organization. He has worked as a lawyer for Adameer a rights group that assists Palestinian prisoners that Israel has banned for alleged ties to the PFLP.

He spent seven years in prison after being convicted in an alleged plot to kill a prominent rabbi but was released in a 2011 prisoner swap with the Hamas militant group. He was not charged or convicted in the latest proceedings against him.

Israel however claimed he continued his activities with the banned group stripped him of residency and placed him last March in administrative detention — a status that allows Israel to hold suspected militants for months at a time without charging them or putting them on trial.

Shaked ordered the deportation when his detention order expired. Israel’s Supreme Court had rejected an appeal against the decision to revoke Hammouri’s residency status. His lawyers have complained that the decision was based on secret evidence they were not allowed to see.

France’s Foreign Ministry condemned Israel’s deportation of Hammouri after he landed in Paris saying it has “taken full action including at the highest level of the state to ensure that Mr. Salah Hamouri’s rights are respected that he benefits from all legal remedies and that he can lead a normal life in Jerusalem where he was born resides and wishes to live.”

It was not clear what if any steps the French government might take.

The Israeli human rights group HaMoked which had defended Hammouri condemned Sunday’s expulsion. A Jan. 1 hearing on the matter had been scheduled and it was not immediately clear how Israel was able to push ahead with the deportation.

“Deporting a Palestinian from their homeland for breach of allegiance to the state of Israel is a dangerous precedent and a gross violation of basic rights” said the group’s director Jessica Montell. “HaMoked will continue to fight against this unconstitutional law.”

Last year Hammouri was among six human rights activists whose mobile phones were found by independent security researchers to have been infected with spyware made by the Israeli company NSO Group.

It was not known who placed the spyware on the phones. Israel said there’s no connection between the terror designation of Adameer and five other Palestinian rights groups and any alleged use of NSO spyware. Israel has provided little evidence publicly to support the terrorism designation which Palestinian groups say is meant to muzzle them and dry up their sources of funding.

Shaked a member of a small nationalist party failed to win re-election to parliament in elections last month.

Aryeh Deri who is expected to to assume the post in the new government said Hammouri’s deportation was “the end of a long but just legal process” and congratulated Shaked for carrying it out.

The new government is still being formed by designated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It will have to pass special legislation to allow Deri to serve as a minister because of his recent conviction on tax offenses.

Israel captured east Jerusalem home to the city’s most important religious sites in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed the area in a move that is not internationally recognized. It considers the entire city to be its capital while the Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.

While Jews in the city are entitled to automatic citizenship Palestinians are granted residency status. This allows them freedom of movement the ability to work and access to Israeli social services but they are not allowed to vote in national elections. Residency rights can be stripped if a Palestinian is found to live outside the city for an extended period or in certain security cases.

Palestinians can apply for citizenship. But few do not wanting to be seen as accepting what they see as an occupation. Those who do apply however face a lengthy and bureaucratic process.

The Haaretz daily reported this year that fewer than 20000 Palestinians in Jerusalem some 5% of the population hold Israeli citizenship and that just 34% of applications are approved.

Prosecutors made the accusations in an indictment charging three media executives and a sports marketing company with a number of crimes including wire fraud and money laundering in connection with bribes to secure television and marketing rights for international soccer tournaments.

The accusations were the latest in a yearslong corruption case that has already produced convictions of numerous soccer officials and executives as well as depositions from former leaders of FIFA world soccer’s governing body. Never before though have prosecutors so clearly described the scheme that helped deliver the votes that gave Russia and Qatar hosting rights for one of the world’s biggest sporting events.

The U.S. prosecutors on Monday explicitly revealed details about money paid to five members of FIFA’s top board ahead of the 2010 vote to choose Russia and Qatar as hosts. Russia defeated England and joint bids from Holland-Belgium and Spain-Portugal to host the 2018 men’s tournament.

Lionel. As in Messi. As in the soccer superstar who on Sunday just might lead Argentina to the World Cup title and cement his name as the best ever to play the game.

“I think every Argentine fan truly believes that as long as we have Messi anything is possible” said Thomann of Elmhurst. “We could be down 3-0 with just five minutes left but if we have Messi we might turn it around. You just never know what he’s going to do.”

Messi who at 35 is ancient for an elite soccer player has said the championship game against France will be his final World Cup appearance. That has amplified the rooting interest if such a thing is possible among Argentines in the Chicago area and soccer fans who picked up an affinity for the diminutive wizard during his long stint at club superpower FC Barcelona.

“I have been watching football since 1996 and I (have) yet to see a footballer as elegant and mesmerizing on the pitch as Lionel Messi” said Chicagoan Editi Mfon. “That is why I am a Messi fan. He is the best player I have ever watched in my life.”

Peter Fonseca of Palos Hills grew up rooting for Real Madrid Barcelona’s great rival but Messi’s otherworldly skill eventually won him over. He said the entire Argentine squad now appears devoted to helping their captain win the one major title that has eluded him.

“It seems like they have one goal and it’s to deliver the championship not just to Argentina but to Lionel Messi” he said. “He’s been the lifeblood the guy who stirs the drink. He’s their everything.”

Messi has twice played in Chicago. The first time in 2013 was a charity match. In 2016 he scored a hat trick in 20 minutes to lead Argentina past Panama in the Copa America international tournament.

“When Messi came in things were taken care of” Argentina coach Gerardo Martino told reporters in the aftermath.

But even when he plies his trade far away Messi remains close to the hearts of local Argentines.

Daniel Thomann and his son Lionel named after Argentine soccer superstar Lionel Messi take in the Argentina-Poland World Cup game Nov. 30 at a restaurant in Lombard. They plan to return Sunday for the championship game pitting Argentina against France.

Dr. Nicolas Lopez a Rush University Medical Center pathologist who hails from Buenos Aires said Messi is seen as a national team savior just like his venerated predecessor Diego Maradona the late star who led Argentina to the 1986 World Cup title.

While Messi normally is as quiet as Maradona was voluble the Qatar tournament has seen a new combative version emerge. After Argentina’s quarterfinal victory over the Netherlands Messi yapped at the opposing coach complained about the referee and reportedly told a Dutch player who irritated him “What are you looking at stupid?”

Lopez thinks that combativeness is a good sign. He gets a little spiky himself when the team plays.

“I watch the games by myself usually because I get very emotional start yelling and screaming” he said. “It’s horribly embarrassing for me to behave that way in public. I’m a physician a serious person. If I go off character like that I’d rather do it in private.”

Argentines have pondered the Messi-Maradona comparison for years with many downgrading Messi because of his lack of a World Cup title. Argentine-American Juliana Cancelo who co-owns Bocaditos Cafe in Batavia with her mother Silvia Sanchez said the hierarchy has been clear.

“The ranking is God the Pope and Maradona” she said. “They’re all Argentine we like to say.”

Poland’s Kamil Glik center tries to block a shot from Argentina’s Lionel Messi during the World Cup group C soccer match between Poland and Argentina at the Stadium 974 in Doha Qatar on Nov. 30 2022.

But she thinks tying G.O.A.T. status to World Cups is unfair given the fleeting nature of the tournaments and likens the debate to the Michael Jordan-LeBron James argument that bubbles up on American sports talk shows — an amusing way to pass the time but nothing to be taken seriously.

Dani Martinez president of the supporters club Penya Barcelonista Chicago has a different opinion.

“For Barcelona fans he is already the greatest of all time” he said. “For most of the rest the (World Cup championship) is necessary.”

Nicolas Peralta Ramos of Argentina’s consulate general in Chicago which serves the roughly 25000 Argentines who live in the Midwest gave a fittingly diplomatic answer to the Messi-Maradona question.

“(Messi) is a major figure for what he has done until now” he said. “This is his fifth World Cup. Every time he plays with the national jersey he does his best. … We’d love Messi to win but it’s football. France is a very talented team. If we lose the final he will still be there with Maradona.”

Migrant workers celebrate Argentina’s Lionel Messi open goal in the World Cup round of 16 soccer match between Argentina and Australia as they watch on a big projection screen at the Asian Town Cricket Stadium in Doha Qatar on Dec. 3 2022.

A Chicago fan who asked to be identified by her Twitter handle @GeekGHappyDance said she became enraptured with soccer after watching Messi play during Argentina’s run to the 2014 World Cup final. To her the wonder he can conjure goes beyond sports.

“To watch Messi play is the thrill that at any second you could see something totally unexpected and original” she wrote in an email. “Something that 99% of players would never think of — let alone attempt. It’s inspiring to see someone make their human body and an inanimate object do exactly what they envision in their mind a millisecond or two after they dream it. Messi’s play is high level art.”

Messi now plays club soccer for Paris Saint-Germain — one of his teammates is French megastar Kylian Mbappe whom he will face in the World Cup final — but he is reportedly mulling whether to come to Inter Miami CF next year which would allow Americans to see him up close on a regular basis.

Still the final word in his legacy likely will be written Sunday. To that end Daniel and Lionel Thomann — who plays forward like his namesake for the Team Elmhurst youth soccer club — plan to watch the game on their lucky TV above their lucky table at their lucky restaurant wearing matching No. 10 blue and white Messi jerseys.

Daniel Thomann pondered what is at stake then refused to imagine anything other than a happy ending.

“When we win” he said “(Messi) will basically be regarded as the greatest of all time.”

World Cup 2022 format: How it worked

The 2022 World Cup kicked off on November 20 with host nation Qatar facing Ecuador in Group A. For 10 glorious days afterwards four World Cup matches were broadcast to fans every day bar one.

Once every team had played the other three in their group the top two finishers advanced to the knockouts. The bottom two teams went home — with some major casualties along the way.

Then came the knockout phase: one match one winner no chance for redemption. They were fiercely contested with four matches so tight they went to penalties. One more shootout would see Qatar 2022 become the most penalties-heavy World Cup ever.

Counting down from the Round of 16 to the quarterfinals to the semifinals and then Argentina vs France the final at Lusail Stadium on December 18.

The semifinal losers Croatia and Morocco met to decide third place won by Croatia 2-1.

“China retaliates fully plus 10 per cent” said Jeffrey Moon president of China Moon Strategies. “They have consistent goals when they retaliate. They want to inflict proportionate pain avoid negative impact on China and want to claim deniability.”

01:36 AI chip maker ordered by US government to halt exports to China AI chip maker ordered by US government to halt exports to China

The relatively muted response from normally blustery Beijing after Washington announced restrictions on high-end semiconductors and chip-making equipment – a potentially huge blow to its economy youth employment and vision of a reshaped society under the Communist Party blueprint – has analysts and former US officials parsing China’s thinking even as they wait for the other shoe to drop.

Within days of the early October announcement Beijing issued a pro forma verbal response – terming the US restrictions “sci-tech hegemony” and a “malicious” violation of trade rules. But there has been little concrete resistance or lashing out.

“It is a puzzle” said Scott Kennedy a senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “On everything else they seem to have skin that’s thinner than Saran Wrap.”

Analysts say several factors appear to be at play. Beijing has a lot on its plate. The US announcement came a week before the hugely consequential 20th party congress – apparently driven more by Washington’s bureaucratic timelines than any desire to poke Beijing in the eye – during which President Xi Jinping secured an unprecedented third term.

On other fronts the leadership is grappling with a public health crisis after it eased “zero Covid” restrictions following protests in dozens of Chinese cities and infections soared. Xi has also returned to in-person global diplomacy with trips to Saudi Arabia; Indonesia for the G20 meeting; and Uzbekistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. And China is preparing for a major government reshuffle in March.

That said Beijing is fully capable of multitasking analysts said especially when it comes to expressing – and acting upon – its displeasure.

Washington announced the chip export restrictions in early October without warning to thwart China’s ability to stockpile chips of potential military use. These include a ban on high-end semiconductors and chip-making technologies with potential dual civilian and military applications prohibitions against US citizens working on Chinese practices and expanded trade blacklists of Chinese companies.

On Thursday Washington added Chinese memory chip maker Yangtze Memory Technologies Company (YMTC) and 35 other Chinese players in the artificial intelligence chip sector to the list effectively blocking their access to critical technologies.

The US is also pressuring the Netherlands and Japan to add their own restrictions on cutting-edge manufacturing equipment even as it faces some resistance.

A second possible factor behind China’s relatively muted response may be divisions among party and government officials and top industry executives – including those from national champions YMTC Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation and Chang Xin Memory Technologies – on how to respond.

“Officials in Beijing are likely still digesting the full impact of the 7 October controls on key companies … and coming up with a response focused on assisting the domestic industry” said Paul Triolo senior vice-president at the Albright Stonebridge Group.

“Beijing may also be reluctant to take a major public retaliatory measure before the visit of Secretary of State [Antony] Blinken to China early next year.”

Kennedy who recently met with Chinese and foreign embassy officials and company executives in Beijing said he heard widely divergent views on China’s ability to overcome the restrictions and about what counter policies it might pursue suggesting a lack of consensus.

“Although the Xi Jinping-led CCP has the image of a risk-taking rapid reaction force actually on a wide range of issues they seem to be highly tentative or unsure about how to proceed” Kennedy said citing policies related to Covid-19 the beleaguered property sector fiscal reform and property taxes.

A third and potentially the most consequential factor behind Chinese reticence may be China’s weak leverage. One of its go-to responses when angry – cutting off access to its huge consumer market – is not terribly effective in this case. China badly needs the high-end chips most of which go into exports or military technology and not domestic products. And it would likely come out worse in any tit-for-tat showdown making it difficult for Beijing to inflict proportionate pain.

Beijing’s inclination to hit back hard when challenged follows in part because it often plays well domestically and can be an effective strategy for getting its way particularly with smaller less powerful nations more easily intimidated.

While China has the legal architecture to intensify pressure on multinationals and foreign governments – including unreliable entity lists antitrust and anti-competitive laws review authority over global mergers and acquisitions anti-foreign sanctions and foreign direct product rules national security cybersecurity and data privacy laws – it has rarely used these against tech firms. In a couple of cases it has threatened to sanction US defence contractors without following through.

Blocking – or threatening to block – Intel Texas Instruments Micron Nvidia Apple and other US companies’ access to the Chinese market would further curtail chip supplies that China needs and scare away already skittish multinationals in other industries. This comes as China struggles to attract foreign investment its economy swoons on the heels of Covid restrictions and unemployment among new college graduates hits a record high.

A sledgehammer option where it does have leverage would be an export ban on rare earth alloys and magnets lithium and other minerals. China accounts for 63 per cent of the world’s rare earth mining 85 per cent of rare earth processing 92 per cent of rare earth magnet production and 60 per cent of lithium processing. These materials are vital for a wide array of hi-tech products from cellphones missiles and stealth aircraft to electric vehicles and wind turbines central to Biden’s climate agenda.

But Beijing would potentially face even tougher US tech restrictions and suffer a major hit to its global stature with such a move. When China limited rare earths exports after 2006 ostensibly on environmental grounds and threatened shipments to Japan after a 2010 collision near contested islands it faced global opprobrium and a World Trade Organization (WTO) challenge by the US Japan and the European Union that it ultimately lost.

“Beijing has few ready options to engage in a punitive symmetric response and the tools that are available all have major downsides like further poisoning the business climate for foreign firms” said Triolo. “With the economy already reeling from Covid lockdowns Beijing is eager to avoid making things worse.”

Short on punitive moves Beijing has mapped out longer-term strategies aimed at reducing its dependence on foreign technology.

It has improved funding pipelines for Chinese companies. And it is increasing support with a planned US$143 billion five-year subsidy and tax-credit package Reuters reported citing sources.

Analysts also expect Beijing to accelerate efforts to attract foreign expertise poach intellectual property acquire chips and manufacturing equipment through grey-market channels and pursue divide-and-conquer tactics to hive off more vulnerable US allies and avoid isolation.

China also has a history of exacting stealth retribution in ways difficult to pin down such as slowing down visas and trade flows enforcing debatable safety and health standards and enacting restrictive policies based on environmental or other difficult-to-quantify standards.

“I think China is taking a quiet approach” said Xiaomeng Lu geotechnology director at the Eurasia Group. “That’s how I would categorise their reaction so far.”

One closely watched area is China’s antitrust vetting authority. Intel has announced plans to buy Israel-based Tower Semiconductors for US$5.4 billion which would require that major global regulators sign off.

China potentially could drag its feet on approving the deal until it expired to punish the US chip maker. “And then maybe months later or years later the words will come out that the real reason is political” Lu said. “But at the time they will say we did our math the economic impact is the reason we’re blocking this deal or just not explain at all.

“That’s one very likely scenario.”

Another possible Beijing move would be to tweak regulations by for instance revising its energy efficiency standard for servers. These standards are updated regularly typically on esoteric technical grounds. But some industry watchers are concerned that the latest standards give older-generation computers – where China is stronger – better ratings than those powered by more efficient chips where US companies prevail in this huge market.

Beijing’s recent decision to file a WTO case  seen as a low-percentage move that could take years underscores its relatively weak hand in retaliating which could drive Taiwan South Korea and other tech allies closer to Washington Lu said.

But experts also cite the risk of tech competition going too far in this high-stakes face-off undercutting global investment R&D and long-term planning. Many sub-sectors are not militarily sensitive and having interdependent supply chains often lowers cost on both sides benefits consumers and can reduce tensions and potential conflict.

“You’ve got the world’s largest market and the world’s largest economy at loggerheads with each other that’s going to create a whole lot of tension” said Jimmy Goodrich a vice-president at the Semiconductor Industry Association. “What that’s meant is that firms increasingly are being forced to choose a side.”

Some analysts say China may be rethinking its long-standing use of blunt economic leverage as resistance grows. “Crass economic coercion is running into more headwinds than it used to” said Kennedy.

In recent months China has been taken aback not only by the relatively unified European opposition to its retaliation against Lithuania but also the way the West has closed ranks behind Ukraine even as Beijing supports Russia. And with recent more targeted US tech restrictions it finds itself with fewer cards to play.

“This is probably the most effective response to China’s industry policy that any US administration has ever introduced; we’re seeing real results” said Moon formerly with the Office of the US Trade Representative and a consul general in Chengdu. “China doesn’t have the option of inflicting proportionate pain because semiconductors are so import to China’s economic future and five-year plans and all the party documents.”

“If it did I think it’s pretty clear that the Biden administration is prepared to ratchet up sanctions even more” he added. “It would probably be self-defeating.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmUtYXJjaGl0ZWN0LmNvbS9taWFtaS82MzMtc2UtM3JkLWF2ZS10b3dlci1mb3J0LWxhdWRlcmRhbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,633 SE 3rd Ave Tower Fort Lauderdale Florida,"633 SE 3rd Ave Tower images Fort Lauderdale skyscraper FL Florida real estate design US architecture images

ODA’s Newest Tower Features Distinct Cylindrical Design

NEW YORK NY – September 13 2022 – New York-based architecture and design studio ODA reveals the design of its newest project in South Florida located south of the New River in the Rio Vista neighborhood of Fort Lauderdale. The striking 47-story tower being developed by Dependable Equities is a large mixed-use building that will bring a heightened sense of sophistication to this part of the city. With a large corner plaza and activated walkways ODA aims to add dynamic and lively ground floor programming to the neighborhood.

ODA’s design for 633 SE 3rd Ave is dominated by a sequence of stepped rounded volumes that elegantly ease the massing of the tower as it rises. The tubular volumes alternate between a sleek curved glazed façade and alternating wrap-around balconies generating a dynamic play that breaks up the massing of the building. Through setbacks and carved double height voids the building offers a series of extensive roof deck amenities for its residents at different levels with wide open views to the city.

“Buildings at this scale house a community of people who live work and play from what they consider home” said Eran Chen Founder and Executive Director ODA. “This new lifestyle is formed by a building that is shaped to be flexible create strong connections and allows for diverse activities.”

The program comprises 830 rental units and 13000 square feet of commercial use. The podium is lined with residential units that continue the tower expression and a dynamic three-dimensional parking screen façade paralleling the theme established by the cylindrical tower design. At night the concave recesses of the parking facade create a decorative wall of light and textures that adds to the ambiance of the neighborhood.

It was a sunny day in New York City when I realized that my sky was being stolen.

The first sign of trouble was the crane. Its thin finger appeared over the old brick building outside my window scratching at the sliver of sky I could just make out above the rooftops. My sky. In a city where you can sprain your neck searching for sky I relished this shard of blue so tiny that I could cover it with my thumb.

I consoled myself about the crane with the flimsy logic I once used after discovering a bedbug: It’ll go away!

It didn’t.

When the metal skeleton of a skyscraper materialized beneath the crane I told myself that the new building would top out soon. It couldn’t possibly get much taller.

But the skeleton kept stretching. It rose above the brick building then over the windows of neighboring apartments walling off precious blue behind it. It was so tall so thin I began to doubt that the cross-hatching of metal beams could actually be a building.

We’re living through the birth of a new species of skyscraper that not even architects and engineers saw coming. After 9/11 experts concluded that skyscrapers were finished. Tall buildings that were in the works got scaled down or canceled on the assumption that soaring towers were too risky to be built or occupied. “There were all sorts of symposiums and public statements that we’re never going to build tall again” one former architect told The Guardian in 2021. “All we’ve done in the 20 years since is build even taller.”

There are skyscrapers and then there are supertalls often defined as buildings more than 300 meters in height but better known as the cloud-puncturing sci-fi towers that look like digital renderings even when you’re staring at them from the sidewalk. First supertalls were impossible then a rarity. Now they’re all over the place. In 2019 alone developers added more supertalls than had existed prior to the year 2000; there are now a couple hundred worldwide including Dubai’s 163-story Burj Khalifa (a hypodermic needle aimed at space) Tianjin’s 97-floor CTF Finance Centre (reminiscent of a drill bit boring the clouds) and encroaching on my sky Manhattan’s 84-floor Steinway Tower (a luxury condominium resembling the love child of a dustbuster and a Mach3 razor).

Some supertalls have an even more futuristic designation: superslim. These buildings are alternately described as “needle towers” or “toothpick skyscrapers” (though not every superslim is a supertall). Early superslims shot up in Hong Kong in the 1970s though lately they’ve become synonymous with New York City; four supertall superslims loom over the southern end of Central Park in a stretch of Midtown dubbed “Billionaires’ Row.” Building engineers like judgy modeling agents have varying definitions of superslim but they usually agree that such buildings must have a height-to-width ratio of at least 10 to 1. To put that in perspective the Empire State Building (one of the world’s first supertalls completed in 1931) is about three times taller than it is wide—“pudgy” as one engineer described it to me. Steinway Tower is 24 times taller than it is wide—nearly as slim as a No. 2 pencil and the skinniest supertall in the world. (The developer’s official name for the building is 111 West 57th Street.) These superslim buildings—and supertalls generally—have relied on engineering breakthroughs to combat the perilous physics that go with height. A 2021 article in the journal Civil Engineering and Architecture declared: “There is no doubt that super-tall slender buildings are the most technologically advanced constructions in the world.”

Like many cutting-edge innovations supertalls can behave unpredictably. In strong winds occupants have reported water sloshing in toilet bowls chandeliers swaying and panes of glass fluttering. The architect Adrian Smith who has designed numerous supertalls contends that you’re in supertall territory not just when you hit 300 meters but when you build so high that you get into “potentially unknown issues.” And he acknowledges there are “still mistakes being made.”

Supertalls aren’t necessarily good neighbors. Their shadows can reach half a mile and they can magnify the winds at street level churning the air into high-speed gusts as far as three blocks away. Many New Yorkers consider the city’s proliferating supertalls at best an eyesore—“Awful Waffle” is one nickname for 432 Park Avenue a luxury condominium that looks like a strip of graph paper stuck on the Manhattan skyline. At worst they’re considered nonsensical constructions that exacerbate the city’s affordable-housing crisis contribute to climate change and stand as totems to inequality. An earlier generation of supertalls mostly housed offices but today many of New York’s supertalls are designed to serve as homes for the superrich—“the modern-day castle if you will” says Stephen DeSimone a structural engineer who’s worked on supertalls in the city. “You’re living amongst the sky like the rest of the world isn’t good enough.”

Supertalls have made even fans of tall buildings wonder whether we’ve built too high for too few—and finally gone too far. Staring up at them from the dark blustery sidewalk it’s hard not to wonder: Is there anything to love?

High-rises have become so ubiquitous it’s easy to forget what a triumph it is to build even a humdrum office tower. For millennia our ancestors inched slowly but steadily toward the clouds. Archaeologists have called the Tower of Jericho completed about 10000 years ago the “super-skyscraper of its day.” It reached a grand total of 28 feet. Around 2600 B.C. the Great Pyramid of Giza broke records when it hit 480 feet—less than half the height of the Eiffel Tower—and humans took nearly 4000 years to go higher. (The spire of an English cathedral eventually surpassed the Great Pyramid in 1311 but only by about three floors.)

From the Tower of Jericho through the Industrial Revolution there was basically one way to go high: stone. Traditionally masonry walls supported a building’s weight and structure which curtailed their height. Going taller required thicker walls which beyond a certain point risked monopolizing floor space and squeezing tenants into sunless cavities. The New York World Building briefly the city’s tallest in 1890 had some walls wider than a garbage truck.

Steel skeletons sent us higher to mixed reviews. As skyscrapers began appearing on the New York skyline at the turn of the century—back when skyscraper meant any building with more than a dozen floors—observers warned that these buildings were a “menace to public health and safety” that would surely collapse. After a building spree in the ’70s the urban historian Dolores Hayden criticized skyscrapers as “phallic monuments” that had been forced on cities by unchecked capitalists and stood as emblems of “architectural rape.”

And yet for as long as we’ve been finding new ways to build taller we’ve usually felt uneasy about doing so. The biblical story of the Tower of Babel is an early example of our altitude-lust going hand in hand with regret over our hubris: After that supertall scraped the heavens God supposedly punished humans by taking away our shared language and scattering us around the globe.

Some cities tried to restrict skyscrapers after watching them transform New York’s skyline in the early 20th century and lots of places still have laws meant to limit buildings’ height. Bali restricts buildings to the approximate height of a lanky palm tree and Washington D.C. imposes a height maximum based on street width. Even China after a two-decade supertall spree recently imposed a height limit of sorts outlawing the construction of buildings over 500 meters—slightly taller than the Steinway Tower outside my window.

From the March 2011 issue: How skyscrapers can save the city

But humans keep hungering to go higher. “Boy it is innate in us” says Bill Baker a structural engineer at Skidmore Owings & Merrill who played a key role in designing the Burj Khalifa. During the latter half of the 20th century the record for the world’s tallest building crept up approximately 16 stories; in the past 20 years it’s shot up nearly 90 floors. We’ve never witnessed buildings rise so much so quickly. From high-rises we’ve stretched to supertalls and even megatalls (double the height of a supertall) and engineers are already discussing “ultratalls” that would take us higher still. Over the past few decades new combinations of materials like microsilica and fly ash (a residue that results from burning coal) have made concrete steroidally strong—“10 times as strong as the stuff down on the sidewalk” in some cases Baker told me—and steel has gotten sturdier too all of which has helped spur the supertall boom. Advances in elevator technology—such as ultra-strong lightweight cables and algorithms that efficiently consolidate passengers—have also helped buildings stretch. But engineering advances aren’t the main reason supertalls keep growing. “It’s a message of power” the developer Don Peebles who in 2021 proposed a 1600-foot tower in Midtown Manhattan told me. “It’s not trying to blend in. It’s trying to stand out.”

The symbolism attached to height is no doubt part of what makes tall buildings so divisive. A century ago many New York churchgoers felt a moral duty not to let offices rise over their houses of worship whose spires had dominated the city’s skyline for decades. In 1923 rallying around a cry to “restore the cross to the skyline!” a Methodist congregation unveiled plans for a skyscraper church that would be the tallest building in history topped with a glowing revolving five-story cross. But the building never reached its full grandeur topping out at a little more than three stories as new taller office towers continued to overtake the skyline.

The evolution of our nation’s tallest structures can arguably be divided into three broad phases. First the tallest buildings were built in honor of deities then commerce and now: billionaires.

If life in the clouds sounds tempting allow me to direct your attention to the price tag. When 432 Park Avenue first went on the market in 2012 it offered a basement storage closet smaller than a parking spot for $198000—more than the median price of a home in Des Moines Iowa. At $169 million its top-floor penthouse was for a time in 2021 the most expensive listing in Manhattan. (As of this writing the penthouse is still on the market. Its most recent broker declined to share its current price which is not listed.)

Supertalls loom over a stretch of Midtown Manhattan dubbed “Billionaires’ Row.” (Jeffrey Milstein)

Who pays to live in the sky? It’s not easy to find out. According to public records lots of the units in Midtown’s residential supertalls were purchased by anonymous limited-liability companies many of them with names implying a bored exhaustion with shuffling money around. Apartment 40A at 432 Park belongs to an entity called 432Park40A LLC. Other LLCs read like AOL screen names: Ashmonster Cupcake Lily Bigappleview Euclidean Taco Distance. Rarely do you come across an actual person’s name—one perk of buying via LLC is the privacy—though some digging reveals buyers who are connected to sports tech finance real estate. One buyer served time for running an illegal gambling ring. Before they sold their place Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez had an apartment at 432 Park. Many units have owners but not dwellers: This fall four properties for sale at 432 Park advertised that they’d never been occupied.

That includes the penthouse. “Never before lived in” beams Ryan Serhant a former star of Million Dollar Listing New York and one of the brokers who has represented the apartment in a home tour he posted on YouTube in 2021. “A true one of one. A world marvel.”

“I don’t really see us as selling real estate” Serhant told me. “I sell a transfer of enthusiasm and excitement and brand.”

Could I come see this world marvel?

Absolutely not Serhant’s PR consultant informed me on his behalf. The penthouse’s owner—reportedly a billionaire Saudi real-estate developer—hadn’t okayed visits to the apartment from journalists. Moreover Serhant wouldn’t even discuss 432 Park I was told.

This didn’t seem unrelated to a lawsuit that 432 Park’s condo board has filed against the building’s developer. The plaintiffs claim that the building is riddled with more than 1500 defects that have led to leaks cracks electrical explosions and elevator shutdowns that trapped people for hours—as well as “horrible and obtrusive noise and vibrations” including clicks creaks and a trash chute that thunders “like a bomb.” Also—pull out your tiny violins—breakfast in the private restaurant is no longer free. (The developer denied these allegations in court filings saying they were “vastly exaggerated” and maintaining that 432 Park is “without a doubt safe.” Lawyers for the developer acknowledged that when the building had first opened its “sophisticated symphony of systems needed to be fine-tuned” and said the board had denied the access needed to do necessary work.)

Occupants of tall buildings have in high winds reported nausea distractibility difficulty working and fatigue.

Supertalls have generated a litany of complaints that make them sound like evil X-Men in their ability to wreak havoc on a city. The allegations against them include unleashing hazardous ice (a man reportedly suffered a “major injury” when ice slid off Central Park Tower) heating cities (the United Nations blames tall buildings generally for contributing to potentially dangerous urban temperatures) monopolizing the sky (critics claim that supertall developers have exploited zoning loopholes unfairly stretching their towers by cramming in extra floors under the guise that they house mechanical elements) and obliterating the sun (a “Sunshine Task Force” has investigated the shadows that supertalls cast on Central Park). Sun beaming off skyscrapers’ glass facades has apparently resulted in so-called death rays strong enough to melt a van’s dashboard and singe a pool-goer’s hair.

The Jeddah Tower is a one-kilometer-tall building planned for Jeddah Saudi Arabia and would be the world’s tallest structure. Fortunately its architects added a large canopy to the base of the supertall’s curved glass facade. One of the goals: to keep it from frying pedestrians like ants under a magnifying glass.

On a Tuesday morning in the fall of 2021 Volodymyr Tyrol took the elevator to the top floor of 432 Park Avenue climbed the stairs to the roof and while practically eye-level with the Empire State’s spire went right over the side of his favorite building in the city. Tyrol who’s scrutinized practically every square foot of 432 Park’s exterior was a window washer for five years (he now works in management for the same company). He is 27 years old enjoys photography and is scared of heights.

Tyrol moved to New York in 2017 from Lviv Ukraine where he lived in a second-floor apartment from which he refused to look down. After arriving in the United States he got a job cleaning windows. His boss considered his fear of heights an asset. “He said ‘We prefer to hire people who are afraid of heights’ ” Tyrol recalled. “It means you’re going to be more careful and more safe.”

Tyrol started low but then began dangling off many of New York’s supertalls. 432 Park is the first Tyrol ever cleaned and he’s since returned too many times to count. To get to work there he’d leave his apartment in Sheepshead Bay commute below the earth via subway then propel himself 1400 feet into the air where finally “I feel like I wake up” Tyrol told me. “When I see that view I feel like power comes to me like the whole power from the city comes to me.” At 432 Park Tyrol could wash about 100 windows a day; the whole building took about two weeks.

Tyrol does not consider 432 Park an “Awful Waffle.” He views supertalls as inspiring testaments to human ingenuity—proof that “whatever you imagine it’s possible to do.” A few years back Tyrol was dispatched to a supertall to remove the plastic film over the windows that had protected them during construction. In that moment he felt like he was a part of history he told me. “I’m unwrapping a gift for New York City.”

From the December 2017 issue: The weird wooden future of skyscrapers

It’s a gift many New Yorkers wish they could return—but then some of supertalls’ alleged crimes may be overstated. The superslims along Central Park cast shadows that are long yes but also skinny which means they pass quickly; one shadow consultant told The New York Times that shorter and wider buildings such as the 20-story Plaza Hotel are more disruptive because they shade parts of Central Park for the whole day. Wide buildings can whip up the wind at street level too. Some urban-planning experts have also pushed back on the idea that New York’s supertalls are exacerbating the city’s housing crunch (one economist calls them a distraction from the key issue of zoning) or hollowing out the urban core with empty pieds-à-terre (one urban historian contends that cramming billionaires into supertalls is preferable to the situation in London where absentee owners park cash in empty rowhouses that are spread out horizontally). Though they are energy-inefficient resource hogs supertalls could in theory help foster high-density urban living which might cut down on emissions from commuting and increase housing stock where land is at a premium. (Developers are trying to build a supertall in Lower Manhattan that would include some affordable-housing units though the plan has met opposition from the community.)

Many of the charges leveled against supertalls today are reminiscent of those brought against the Empire State Building when it first opened: It was too empty. It would cause too much congestion. It represented the triumph of greed. And yet in Central Park tourists are already posing for photos in front of Midtown’s supertalls. “In 2050 when these slender towers are eligible for landmark protection” writes the urban historian and Skyscraper Museum director Carol Willis “I have no doubt that some—such as 432 Park Avenue and 111 W 57 Street—will be designated as superior examples of the iconic forms characteristic of New York of the 2010s.”

Perhaps because window washers aren’t allowed out on the scaffold when wind speeds exceed 25 miles an hour Tyrol said he’s never felt 432 Park move. Yet supertalls not only ascend; they also sway flutter vibrate bend and lean. Often a lot. Chicago’s Willis Tower—which is more than 50 feet taller than 432 Park—can move up to three feet in strong winds. If you were to look down at the spire of a tall building during a windstorm you’d see that it careens left right and around like an inebriated giraffe.

All of that motion can cause people to feel a little drunk themselves. Occupants of tall buildings have in high winds reported nausea distractibility difficulty working and fatigue though researchers report that skyscrapers “rarely if ever induce vomiting.” As winds howl buildings can moan like creaky container ships or clatter like subway cars. “No Realtor would ever give a potential tenant a handbook that explains how these buildings behave because they wouldn’t buy them probably” says Peter Weismantle the director of supertall-building technology for Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture which designed Central Park Tower.

And yet some motion is safe and normal and often goes unnoticed. In fact evolving approaches to handling high winds are a big reason contemporary supertalls have gotten to be so numerous and so thin.

Tall buildings get celebrated as gravity-defying but it’s their defiance of the wind that should inspire awe. Imagine a strong wind blowing south over Central Park. The wind hits the supertall and pushes it backwards into a lean then causes the structure to sway as the gust picks up and dies down. Wind can get stronger at higher altitudes and intensify as it whips off neighboring high-rises so what registers as a gentle breeze on the fifth floor may give way to howling on the 45th. Wind barreling around the supertall creates turbulent eddies on the building’s exterior that cause the structure to wag from side to side. These are the accelerations that tenants are most likely to perceive and slender supertalls are even more susceptible to them.

Developers know they cannot control the wind. What they can do—and this is an industry term—is confuse it. For this they recruit a wind-whisperer like Derek Kelly. Kelly an engineer with the consulting firm RWDI is a garrulous Canadian who when I asked about superslims told me the company has worked on “almost every building you see out your window.”

Read: Colorful lights are turning skyscrapers into tacky billboards

Take 432 Park. Once the developer had an early design for the new tower Kelly began by making the proposed supertall—a solid skinny square column—super small. Kelly and his colleagues 3-D-printed a knee-high model of the building and stuck it into a miniature Midtown Manhattan complete with dozens of neighboring high-rises that can affect the windscape at 432 Park’s site. They put the model buildings on a turntable inside a wind tunnel then subjected them to smoke and powerful fans. RWDI adjusted the wind tunnel’s settings to mimic Manhattan’s gusts and rotated the tiny neighborhood in 10-degree increments to get a baseline measurement of how the proposed supertall would sway absorb winds careening off other structures and shift the wind around it—all of which remains too complex to accurately predict with algorithms Kelly said.

Even a 10-story building will move and most of us can handle our homes wiggling about five milli‑gs (a measure of acceleration) in any direction. Early tests on 432 Park’s prototype revealed poor aerodynamic performance. Rafael Viñoly 432 Park’s architect said in a 2014 lecture at the Skyscraper Museum that tests on one version of the building revealed the supertall would dance 30 milli-gs—just shy of the threshold found to “cause some occupants to lose balance” according to research published in the International Journal of High-Rise Buildings. “If you’re standing here your cup of tea moves” Viñoly said at the lecture rocking his lectern back and forth to demonstrate. He called the experience of 30 milli‑gs “absolutely frightening.”

When problems like these arise Kelly brings the developer and the design team to RWDI’s wind tunnel for a “shaping workshop.” Architects and engineers tweak the shape of their supertall 3-D-print new versions then put each one in the wind tunnel to see how much it moves. “For some of these buildings in New York” Kelly said “we’ve done 12 16 versions in an afternoon.”

The decorative flourishes on a supertall that seem ornamental can be key to diffusing the suction-filled whirlpools that sway a building as wind whips around its sides. You could notch the corners like on Taipei 101 which resembles a towering stack of gifts. You could twist the building like the Twizzler-esque Shanghai Tower. You could taper it to look like the tip of a paintbrush like the Lakhta Center or cut out sections to let wind blow through it like the Shanghai World Financial Center which is nicknamed “The Bottle Opener.” 432 Park’s designers decided to make it more porous: Every 12 stories there are two “blow through” floors with cutouts for windows but no glass.

But can you comfortably host a dinner party on a blustery evening? To try to experience for themselves how hospitable 432 Park would be Viñoly and his colleagues traveled to the Marine Institute in Newfoundland to be jostled around inside its simulator—a 20-ton steel ship’s bridge mounted on hydraulic pistons and surrounded by screens. Typically ships’ crews use the simulator to practice for encounters with icebergs and roiling seas but for the past 15 years the institute has hosted supertall designers who want to double-check their work before they build. On these occasions the institute covers up the nautical instruments projects a city skyline on the screens lugs in a forest-green sofa puts water-filled glasses on a wooden kitchen table and hangs a glass chandelier. Once the supertall’s team of designers settles in the room starts rocking and rolling to mimic what tenants will feel on a windy day during a strong gale or during a once-a-century hurricane. At 432 Park the blow-through floors alone wouldn’t settle the building so the developers ultimately installed two tuned mass dampers—a pair of 600-ton counterweights between the 86th and 89th floors that can move 11 feet to offset the supertall’s sway.

“Billionaires’ Row” in Manhattan (Jeffrey Milstein)

That’s the goal anyway. New cars and planes go through rigorous testing before hitting the assembly line but each supertall is essentially a prototype. “We’re going into production on one-offs every single time with the hopes that we get it right” the structural engineer Stephen DeSimone told me. If you could crawl out over the side of 432 Park and look down at the facade during a windstorm “you’d have not one but two heart attacks. Because the thing does move” Viñoly said in his 2014 lecture. “Don’t tell the tenants that.”

There is a cruel irony in getting lost trying to enter one of the most inescapable buildings on the skyline—a building so impossible to ignore that there’s an Instagram account 432parkseesyou dedicated to cataloging how it follows you around the tristate area. Gazing up at 432 Park from down on 57th Street I could see Tyrol suspended along its facade and a Mac on someone’s desk but for the 15 minutes I spent sprinting around in confusion I couldn’t find my way to the front door.

I eventually discovered the entrance tucked just beyond a white marble driveway lined with pink flowers waiting to be planted and sparkling SUVs waiting for passengers. Four building employees in suits idled around the lobby which felt like the world’s most glamorous airport lounge. It had never occurred to me that air could smell expensive but the oxygen I inhaled felt high-caliber: perfect humidity ideal temperature with a freshness reminiscent of clean laundry.

My host was Noel Berk a real-estate agent who deals in palatial beaux arts townhouses supertall pieds-à-terre and “super super luxury buildings.” She was the exclusive broker for three different apartments for sale at 432 Park at the time including “#79” which her listing describes as a “masterpiece.” The asking price is $135 million.

Berk vets potential buyers before allowing them into her properties. “Anyone that can afford this is an easy Google search” Berk’s partner Doug Graham said of #79. If they’re not Berk will ask for proof that they can pay for the apartment. She was once fooled by someone who rolled up in a limo impersonating a famous musician and the rise of crypto billionaires has complicated due diligence. Ryan Serhant the real-estate broker said he’s had to rely on Reddit research and Coinbase statements.

The elevator let us off on the 12th floor and I trailed Berk as she guided me toward 432 Park’s restaurant—“restaurants plural” she emphasized. Like cruise ships or nursing homes New York’s luxury buildings have waged an amenities arms race trying to lure buyers with perks such as a pool with an underwater soundtrack curated by Carnegie Hall (which as of this second you can find only at One57 a luxury residential supertall across the street from the concert venue).

432 Park’s amenities include a library stocked with thick art books a screening room with velvet armchairs a mahogany-paneled conference room where two people at laptops glanced up at us in surprise and the concierge I’d passed sitting at a low gray desk in the lobby. “He’s there almost every day if you need a private plane if you need plane tickets if you need theater tickets” Berk explained launching into her sales patter. (432 Park’s website says that he could also help with personal shopping art restoration automobile shipping and “celebrity guest appearances.”) There’s a gym a sauna a steam room wine cellars. And you can’t forget security Berk reminded me. “Especially after the election”—in 2016—“there were a lot of demonstrations all over the city and you don’t want people coming into the building that are angry and demonstrating.”

At the end of the hall on the 12th floor a maître d’ stood guard over both restaurants plural and solemnly informed us that we couldn’t visit the more formal dining room because a resident singular was eating there. Through a closed glass door I glimpsed a crystal chandelier the size of a small waterfall and a tiny gray-haired man alone in an expanse of white tablecloths save for a server dressed in a navy blazer. We ducked into the more casual restaurant which opened onto a terrace for alfresco dining. The maître d’ who’d followed us in watched us warily. I wondered aloud why private restaurants were a draw in a city with such fabulous food. “The truly super-wealthy want privacy” Berk said. “They don’t want to share a pool or a restaurant.”

The maître d’ glanced anxiously between us and a group of five who had entered from the terrace and were heading toward us across the restaurant. He jumped back to let them pass—though we were approximately a mile from getting in their way—and sweeping his arm backwards like he was beckoning a dog to heel gestured that we should do the same. Finally when the group was only a few strides away he hissed “Sorry—if you can make a little room for them” and practically threw himself between us and the residents.

Every time we stepped on or off an elevator someone was leaving or waiting to get on. We passed two women in their 60s with teased halos of hair a 30‑something guy in sweats a brunette in tan Chanel flats. The only thing they seemed to have in common was a glowing aura of health but Berk set me straight: The people who buy into supertalls while diverse in age and citizenship generally share a passion for art collecting multiple residences and paying for homes in cash. “And I’ll tell you another thing” she said: “A lot of people that are buying in these buildings buy for their children who are in college and the college student lives in the apartment.”

I stepped into #79 swapped my boots for beige slippers as Berk instructed and gawked.

Apartment #79 is supposedly on the 79th floor though supertalls embrace vanity sizing and technically we were 62 stories above the sidewalk. Still I’d never been in an apartment that was so high up or that so fully hewed to a single vision. The sellers had bought the place as a pied-à-terre and handed it over to the artist (and more recently architect) Hiroshi Sugimoto. He’d designed the minimalist furniture picked the shikkui plaster applied by artisans flown in from Japan and even signed his creation just inside its private elevator landing as though it were one of his black-and-white photographs hanging in the bedrooms.

“You will notice that it’s totally quiet. And still” Berk stressed as I entered a traditional Japanese tearoom lined with tatami mats. “And they say the tall buildings are going to move. You don’t feel that at all!” I didn’t. But wind speeds that afternoon were a listless five miles an hour.

I’ll confess that I probably dragged out the visit longer than I needed to. The place was so peaceful. The hand-carved floorboards in the primary bedroom massaged my feet and the thousand-year-old Yakusugi wood in the “salon” enveloped me in its cedar perfume. “There is absolutely nothing that jars your mind in this apartment” Berk said. “You take a person that has a high-high-high-pressured job and they’re crazed all day—they come here and there’s a calmness that settles their whole body.”

In each room we paused to contemplate the skyline. The Metropolitan Museum of Art looked like a Ritz cracker from this angle while Manhattan’s most eye-catching skyscrapers—the Empire State Building the Chrysler Building One Vanderbilt—were lined up like shots on a bar. Berk inventoried each vista—“That’s Staten Island and that’s Brooklyn … Then you see all the bridges”—as though the city’s landmarks were amenities included with the apartment. You get a wine fridge a sushi bar and Long Island City.

432 Park was once Manhattan’s tallest residential building but I spotted two towers out the window that had since surpassed it. I felt a surprising rush of pride that New York home of the world’s first supertalls was still pushing itself to reach higher and I tried to picture where future supertalls might sprout. There’s basically nothing stopping us from erecting a mile-high building experts insist except maybe money. Sure at certain heights you start to wonder about oxygen or altitude sickness. But technically? It can be done they assured me. “All you really need—you need a bunch of money and a big ego” Peter Weismantle says.

As my time in #79 stretched toward a third hour I realized it was the longest I’d ever gone without hearing honks or sirens in the city. In the living room I felt momentarily disoriented. What city is this again? I felt like I could be anywhere.

“You don’t have to leave the building for anything” Berk told me. “These buildings you could live in for the rest of your life and be taken care of.”

Except eventually I did want to leave. When I finally descended back to the sidewalk I went home in a daze as though I’d just returned from a trip out of town. I spent that evening underground in a basement bar with a stranger’s elbow in my food then took the long route back to the subway immersing myself in the chaos of the street."

It was passed by a vote of 83-11. Last week the House passed the bill on December 8th with an overwhelming majority of 350-80. It will now go to President Biden’s desk for signing into law.

This is the largest Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) in history and comes in at a time when our nation needs it most. The bill provides authorization for the Army Corps of Engineers to carry out water resources infrastructure projects to address flooding waterway transportation and ecosystem restoration. Importantly this bill includes provisions to support Tribal and underserved communities and address climate change.

American Rivers has worked with Congress to include provisions to protect and restore our nation’s rivers and floodplains. Below are some of the key provisions that we are most excited about.

Sections 8111. Tribal Partnership Program; 8112 . Tribal Liaison; 8113 . Tribal Assistance; 8114 . Cost sharing provisions for the territories and Indian Tribes; and 8115 . Tribal and Economically Disadvantaged Communities Advisory Committee are valuable provisions. We support these efforts to improve outreach to and engagement with these communities and give them a seat at the table. We are also pleased to see the initiative to build out the Corps of Engineers workforce through outreach in schools colleges and universities with a prioritization of recruiting from economically disadvantaged communities. We believe these steps will serve both the Corps and the communities well.

With climate change impacting the nation promoting nature-based approaches on a project and watershed level scale is imperative to adapt to increasing floods and water scarcity. WRDA 2022 includes several provisions that will help promote the use of nature-based approaches and better serve and protect our communities while promoting ecosystem resilience through more responsible levee management and floodplain restoration.

Section 8103 – Shoreline and riverbank protection and restoration mission calls for restoring the natural functions and values of rivers and shorelines throughout the United States. Section 8121– Assessment of Corps of Engineers levees will assess for opportunities for modification of levees including for restoring connections with adjacent floodplains. American Rivers also worked to include language for the Corps to identify floodplain reconnection opportunities on federal lands. While this provision was not included in the final bill we will work with the Corps to support sections 8103 and 8121 while continuing to work on getting additional federal levees assessed.

American Rivers worked diligently with our partners at American Whitewater and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership to include section 8122- National Low-Head Dam Inventory. This inventory will contribute significantly to public safety as low-head dams are known public safety hazards and yet not inventoried nationally and making this information publicly available will help river users identify life-threatening low-head dams. We also hope that this inventory will help the public identify obsolete structures that continue to pose a safety hazard and would be suitable for removal. In areas where dam removal is not an option we support additional funding to go towards grants for signage and public education about low-head dams Alden low head Dam Iowa | Photo courtesy of photolibrarian via Flickr

Section 8123 – Expediting hydropower at Corps of Engineers facilities allows for retrofitting Corps dams with hydropower. We support this provision with the understanding that the structures in question are already serving their legislatively authorized purpose and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Recognizing that retrofitting a non-powered Corps dam with hydropower is not always feasible we will continue to advocate for the diligent assessment of these projects and their use to determine if they would better serve the taxpayers community and local ecosystem by being disposed of instead of extending their life solely for non-power purposes.

The consideration of reforestation in section 8137 is an exciting and forward-thinking provision that encourages measures to restore swamps and other wetland forests in studies for water resources development projects. This is another important step towards focusing on ecosystem restoration. The benefits of flood control and water quality improvements that come from healthy swamps and wetlands are incalculable.

There are several provisions related to river restoration and protection and better river management including section 8144 – Chattahoochee River Program section 8145 – Lower Mississippi River Basin demonstration program and section 8219 – Hydraulic evaluation of Upper Mississippi River and Illinois River. The Chattahoochee River program will provide assistance to non-federal interests for water-related resource protection and restoration projects affecting the Chattahoochee River Basin. The Lower Mississippi program will provide assistance to non-federal interests for projects focused on flood or coastal storm risk management or aquatic ecosystem restoration. The hydraulic evaluation of the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois River basins will provide studies on the flows for rivers in the upper basin which we hope will contribute to more effective management and restoration plans.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) studies authorized in section 8236 are encouraging especially the review of mitigation projects and the evaluation of their performance. These studies will require a report on the results of projects and activities to mitigate fish and wildlife losses that occurred as a result of a water resources development project. Within this section we also support the study on the integration of information into the national levee database as this information is essential to the management and improvement of our nation’s levees.

We are pleased to see section 8140 – Policy and technical standards directing the Secretary to update the agency standards. With this update the Corps will have to include climate change and nature-based solutions in their practices. We look forward to the report on the Corps of Engineers reservoirs under section 8153 so that Congress may further evaluate the operation utility and future of these reservoirs.

Overall we applaud the safety and environmental provisions in this bill and the passing of this paramount piece of legislation to protect our natural and engineered water infrastructure and the people that rely on it.

Jaime Sigaran Ted Illston Brian Graber and Eileen Shader",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlcGFsLm9yZy9lbi9ub3Rlcy90cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGl2ZS1yZWNvdmVyeS1sYXRpbi1hbWVyaWNhLWFuZC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tYmFzaWMtZHJpbmtpbmctd2F0ZXItYW5kLWVsZWN0cmljaXR50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A transformative recovery in Latin America and the Caribbean with basic drinking water and electricity services as key ...,"Currently in Latin America and the Caribbean 17 million people do not have access to electricity and 75 million lack access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking. At the same time 161 million people (1 in 4) do not have adequate access to safe drinking water and 431 million (7 in 10) to safely managed sanitation. Deficiencies are associated with problems of access and affordability for example difficulties in paying for or the absence of infrastructure. However there are significant differences between countries.

First people without access to these basic services belong to the lowest segment of the national income distribution. Thus the most vulnerable populations must make a proportionally greater economic effort up to 2.5 times more than the wealthiest to assume the cost of these services. Second this economic inequality is compounded by geographic and social inequalities with rural indigenous and Afro-descendant populations being the most deprived. Finally the quality and structure of housing also influence access to these basic services. In the region 15% of the population living in precarious housing does not have access to electricity.

Inequality in access to drinking water and electricity has increased people's vulnerability.

Inequality in access to these basic services accentuated by the impact of COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine has increased the population vulnerability in the region impacting millions of people physically socially and economically. On the one hand people with less access to clean water and sanitation at the beginning of the pandemic were at a higher risk of contracting the virus. On the other hand due to the reduction in income associated with the loss of employment due to the pandemic. With the increase in fossil fuel prices in the current war context the ability of households to pay for these services has worsened.

During the pandemic almost all countries in the region took measures such as partial reduction and postponement of charges. However once these measures are completed the energy costs of drinking water and sanitation service providers could amount to 40% of their total operating expenses. It is important to take these factors into account to guarantee the satisfaction of basic needs and to ensure resilient systems.

Potable water and electricity policies to drive a transformed recovery

To address the growing vulnerability of the poorest population ECLAC assumes an important role in the transition and proposes a 10-year investment policy to universalize these basic services. It would involve investing 2.6% of the regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually (1.3% to achieve SDG 6 and 1.3% for SDG 7) and would have multiple positive effects:

Reduction of COVID-19 infections and health improvements.

Reactivation of the regional economy through job creation. 700000 new jobs in the development of new energy infrastructures and 3.4 million associated with the drinking water and sanitation sector per year.

Reduction of air and water pollution through a transition to more efficient and cleaner energy sources with circular approaches.

To this end institutional planning and regulatory strengthening are necessary. Together with a more relevant role for cooperation agencies and banks.

The settlement price tag exceeds the largest fine possible said Attorney General Josh Shapiro following the hearing.

Charges were filed against the company in June 2020 by the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General prior to Cabot’s merger with Cimarex to form the new energy company. Coterra spokesman George Stark said settlement negotiations began over one year ago.

The main courtroom in the Susquehanna County Courthouse was filled by about 50 people – some residents in the affected area as well as anti-drilling activists.

Two of the affected residents took the stand on Tuesday.

Ray Kemble a vocal anti-drilling activist – said he felt “vindicated for talking the truth.”

Nolen Scott Ely said that since 2008 he had pursued many avenues to “make right the wrongs done in this area.”

He also spoke of the significant impact his family has felt in those years with water issues occurring since before his children were in kindergarten – until now as they head off to college. “They have never known a safe water source” he said.

Ely said he hoped the drilling company has improved the process and “understand that they destroyed homed and families.”

“This is not a day of vindication” Ely said. “It is a day of replacement.”

Susquehanna County President Judge Legg presided over the no contest plea deal with the following agreed upon details:

* Coterra will pay the mandatory $2500 fine to the Clean Water fund.

* Details of the $16.29 million water well and distribution system – to be operated by Pennsylvania American Water Company (PAWC) – were also put on the record. The funds will be placed into an interest-bearing account in the Office of the Attorney General.

* Each property will have a $50000 credit for the water – which is expected to cover the utility bills for about 75 years.

* While the water well/distribution system is being constructed Coterra will install operate and maintain water treatments systems.

*And if the water system is unable to be completed Coterra will maintain the water treatment systems for 30 years.

*If a property owner does not accept the treatment system or community water Coterra’s obligation will be deemed as satisfied.

The agreement follows the property and not the current landowners.

In a press conference following the hearing Shapiro said ““Residents of Dimock have waited far too long for the clean water Pennsylvania’s Constitution is supposed to guarantee all of us.”

Coterra Energy released a statement following the court appearance: “Coterra has worked closely with the Office of Attorney General to resolve historical matters and create a path forward for all parties. As out operations today showcase Coterra strives to follow best practices exceed industry standards and to continue to be a valuable community partner. We are committed to being a responsible steward of the Commonwealth’s natural resources and will continue to work closely with our landowners and community leaders.”

“This agreement brings justice to the residents of Dimock who for years had been ignored” said Shapiro. “People across the country remember what happened here in Dimock and now they will know the rule of law won the day. Companies will take notice that we won’t allow communities like this to be taken advantage of or forgotten.”

In his statement Shapiro said the agreement is the result of a thorough investigation and evaluation by independent experts to “sample and analyze the water contamination and develop and engineering plan that would best serve the needs of the residents of Dimock.”

PAWC will oversee the construction and operation of the water line. Construction is expected to take three to four years.

Dimock resident Victoria Switzer also spoke at the press conference. She said that up until the resolution residents had been failed at every level – from local state representatives to the Dept. of Environmental Protection and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Although Switzer did not get to hear the drilling company deliver a guilty plea she said “I think $16 million is a good indicator of guilt.”

The resolution Swtizer said is the best scenario for residents. “The Attorney General got it done and I am grateful.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcmVnb25saXZlLmNvbS9zaWxpY29uLWZvcmVzdC8yMDIyLzEyL2dvb2dsZXMtd2F0ZXItdXNlLWlzLXNvYXJpbmctaW4tdGhlLWRhbGxlcy1yZWNvcmRzLXNob3ctd2l0aC10d28tbW9yZS1kYXRhLWNlbnRlcnMtdG8tY29tZS5odG1s0gGgAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9yZWdvbmxpdmUuY29tL3NpbGljb24tZm9yZXN0LzIwMjIvMTIvZ29vZ2xlcy13YXRlci11c2UtaXMtc29hcmluZy1pbi10aGUtZGFsbGVzLXJlY29yZHMtc2hvdy13aXRoLXR3by1tb3JlLWRhdGEtY2VudGVycy10by1jb21lLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google’s water use is soaring in The Dalles records show with two more data centers to come,"Google’s water use in The Dalles has nearly tripled in the past five years and the company’s data centers now consume more than a quarter of all the water used in the city.

That’s according to records released this week after the city settled a lawsuit against The Oregonian/OregonLive and agreed to hand over data on Google’s water consumption. The company’s water use is poised to continue soaring in the years ahead as Google has plans for two more data centers along the Columbia River.

The numbers illuminate a long-running debate over the future of The Dalles’ water supply and the potential consequences of Google’s continued growth.

“If the data center water use doubles or triples over the next decade it’s going to have serious effects on fish and wildlife on source water streams and it’s potentially going to have serious effects for other water users in the area of The Dalles” said John DeVoe executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group WaterWatch.

Google and the city maintain that a deal they struck last year which commits Google to a $28.5 million upgrade in The Dalles’ water infrastructure is adequate to meet future water needs for both the company and its neighbors.

Google ceded some water rights associated with own industrial land signing it over to the city — along with the money to upgrade the water system — in exchange for an increased supply of municipal water.

“What we thought was really important was that we partner with the local utility and actually transfer those water rights over to the utility in a way that benefits the entire community” said Ben Townsend Google’s global head of infrastructure and water strategy.

Google built its first data center in The Dalles in 2005. It has received tax breaks worth at least $260 million since then. The company has also become an important component of the local economy with about 200 employees. Its original data center went onto the tax rolls last year after its property tax exemptions expired generating more than $5 million in local taxes.

The Dalles turned over records of Google’s water consumption this past week after an unsuccessful 13-month legal fight to keep the information secret. In a settlement with The Oregonian/OregonLive The Dalles agreed to provide public access to 10 years of historical data on Google’s water use and to honor future records requests.

The records show that Google’s water use is up threefold since 2017 the year before the company opened a third data center in The Dalles. Data centers are packed with hundreds or thousands of powerful computers. The water provides essential cooling and Google said the increased water consumption reflects the demands of its newest local data center.

Google’s data centers used 355 million gallons of The Dalles’ water last year 29% of the city’s total water consumption. The Dalles whose name is derived from a French term referencing water flowing through a narrow channel has a population of about 16000.

Though it sits along the Columbia River it’s in a meteorologically dry region with less than half the annual rainfall Portland receives 80 miles downstream. Water in the Columbia is under federal jurisdiction and generally off limits to new industrial customers.

And like much of eastern and central Oregon The Dalles has been in a multiyear drought that has farmers environmental watchdogs and tribal fishers worrying about the future.

“I don’t believe that the best interests in the greater community have been in mind. It’s been more of a short-term economic deal … just to get Google in. And then Google’s become a water vampire basically” said Dawn Rasmussen who lives in an unincorporated area of Wasco County outside the city limits.

Rasmussen isn’t a customer of The Dalles’ water utility but she said she’s concerned Google’s growth will draw down water storage throughout the area as climate change alters weather patterns.

Last year’s agreement between Google and the city commits The Dalles to provide an undisclosed volume of water to support the company’s expansion. In exchange Google provided water rights associated with its industrial land donated 35 acres to Wasco County and paid the full cost of the water system upgrade.

Plans call for developing unused groundwater rights and pumping treated water from The Dalles’ water treatment plant into the city’s main aquifer. That would enable the city to draw from it during dry summer months.

The city says it expects to pump more water into the aquifer than it will withdraw and projects having more water available for all users — even with Google’s continued growth — than if it didn’t upgrade. But the project generated intense controversy in The Dalles last year in part because the city refused to say how much water Google was already using.

City attorneys claimed Google’s water use was a “trade secret” exempt from disclosure under Oregon law and sued The Oregonian/OregonLive to block the release of the information. Google paid more than $100000 to fund The Dalles’ legal fight to maintain that secrecy over the past year.

When The Dalles abandoned that effort this past week and agreed to provide the records it agreed to pay another $53000 to Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press the nonprofit organization that represented The Oregonian/OregonLive in the case. Google will also cover those costs.

Google has long maintained a policy of extreme secrecy around its data center operations a policy it reversed last month as The Dalles moved to settle its lawsuit against The Oregonian/OregonLive. Google for the first time disclosed water use at data centers in The Dalles and around the world.

A Google spokesperson said the timing of the company’s reversal on water reporting was probably a coincidence.

The newly issued report showed Google’s data centers used 5.5 billion gallons of water last year worldwide.

Google said it can cool its computers with water or electricity and in designing its data centers it tries to balance the climate impacts of power consumption against the environmental impact of water use. The company said it works with local hydrologists and local governments to decide how to strike that balance in each community.

In The Dalles Google said it structured its deal to capitalize on unused water rights to create additional capacity and ensure there’s enough water for residents the data centers and the nearby water system.

“The (aquifer storage and recovery) project seeks to capture low-hanging fruit that would otherwise be lost and repurpose that for long-term storage” Townsend said. “We think it’s very important to invest in the long-term health of all watersheds where we operate to make sure that resource is protected.”

Others worry there won’t be enough to go around with climate change reducing snowpack in the Cascade Range above The Dalles and contributing to a prolonged drought. Elaine Harvey environmental coordinator for Yakama Nation Fisheries said that water systems that feed The Dalles may not be adequate if Google keeps growing.

“I don’t believe that there’s going to be enough water for two more data centers in The Dalles Oregon if they’re going to specifically take water from that water source” Harvey said. “This is going to have an impact on the plant life fish life wildlife and the community.”

In its report last month Google compares the amount of water its data centers use to the amount used by golf courses in the parched American Southwest. By that metric it says its data centers in The Dalles use the equivalent of 1.8 golf courses.

(The nine-hole golf course at The Dalles Country Club uses about 20 million gallons annually according to the club less than 6% of Google’s local water use.)

But WaterWatch’s DeVoe suggests thinking about Google’s water consumption by a different metric. He said Google uses enough water each year in The Dalles to flood the entire city 3 inches deep.

Regardless of whether one thinks that’s a lot of water or not DeVoe said the problem in the area around The Dalles is that water is already in short supply. He said there simply isn’t enough water to add major new users like Google.

“It just upsets the apple cart because that demand comes on the heels of a fully allocated system and so it becomes really difficult to protect the interests of fish and wildlife in that equation” DeVoe said.

The Dog River which drains out of the Cascades south of The Dalles is of particular concern according to DeVoe. He said it’s an important water source for The Dalles and has already been under strain as the city’s overall water use has increased doubling from 2002 to 2021.

The Dog River is home to three endangered fish species which DeVoe said could be collateral damage as The Dalles thirst continues to increase.

“If the river is going to be de-watered eight or nine months a year those fish are just out of luck” he said. “Google is in part cooling its servers with salmon and steelhead.”

According to Berlin Mayor Franziska Giffey around 264000 gallons of water spilled from the aquarium and almost all of the 1500 tropical fish within were killed. City officials also said two people were injured by broken glass though they are likely to make a full recovery.

While fire officials said the building was not deemed to be in danger Raddison Hotels said they had immediately closed the hotel and would be relocating the guests.

""We offer our full support to the injured guest and our colleague and wish for a speedy recovery"" Raddison said in a statement. ""Members of our leadership team are on site and together with the authorities are looking into the cause of the incident."""

Novo Nordisk Eli Lilly and Amgen’s novel obesity medications demonstrated impressive results in clinical trials. These medications not only reduced weight but improved overall cardiometabolic health.

So is the end of the obesity epidemic near? Not quite. But we’ll soon have a remarkable pipeline of obesity medications at our disposal that function as Swiss Army knives.

In this article I’ll highlight the clinical trial results for some obesity medications in 2022 discuss the future of obesity management and dive into the challenges to ending the obesity epidemic.

The Swiss Army Knives

Novo Nordisk Eli Lilly and Amgen all announced stellar—and I don’t use that word lightly—results from their clinical trials of novel obesity medications. I’ve highlighted some of these trials throughout 2022 including Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide and retatrutide and Amgen’s AMG133. I’ll summarize them later below.

Before touching on the clinical trial results it’s essential to understand each of these medications acts on one some or all of the following receptors: GLP1R GIPR and glucagon-R. These receptors are located throughout the body and have neuro-cardio-metabolic effects hence why I call them Swiss army knives.

There’s still a lot of unknown regarding how manipulating GLP1 GIP and glucagon receptors induce weight-loss effects. However we do know that activating or blocking some of these receptors increases insulin secretion decreases blood glucose and suppresses appetite. Consequently weight-loss and improvement in cardiometabolic health are achieved.

Medications targeting GLP1 and GIP receptors were initially purposed to manage type 2 diabetes. However patients on these medications exhibited profound weight-loss prompting Novo Lilly Amgen and other pharma companies to investigate how these drugs can be used specifically to treat obesity. I highlight some of 2022’s clinical trials below.

Tirzepatide (Eli Lilly)

SURMOUNT-1 was a 72-week-long Phase III double-blind randomized control trial including 2500 participants with a BMI over 30 or 27 with more than one weight-related comorbidity that’s not type 2 diabetes. At the end of the 72-week study period participants’ body weight decreased by 16% in the low-dose group 21% in the medium-dose group and 23% in the high-dose group. Those in the placebo group only lost 2% of their body weight.

Additionally metabolic health indicators improved in the tirzepatide groups. For example participants receiving the drug saw a 20% decrease in triglycerides a 7.5% decrease in non-HDL lipids and a 39% decrease in fasting insulin (this drug is also an anti-diabetic drug). Also HDL levels improved by 9% in the tirzepatide groups.

The FDA granted tirzepatide fast-track designation based on these promising results. However before the FDA approves tirzepatide Lilly must complete its SURMOUNT-2 clinical trial (Summer 2023) which will include patients with type 2 diabetes.

Retatrutide (Eli Lilly)

Lilly announced their Phase II clinical trial of retatrutide showed participants with obesity receiving the drug had a 24% decrease in weight after 48 weeks. Official results have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Lilly will move to Phase III trials.

Semaglutide (Novo Nordisk)

STEP TEENS was a 68-week-long Phase III double-blind randomized control trial including 201 adolescents with a BMI greater than or equal to the 95th percentile or 85th percentile with at least one weight-related comorbidity. Those receiving semaglutide had a significant 16% decrease in BMI compared to baseline while those on placebo had a 0.6% increase. Additionally 73% of those receiving semaglutide lost 5% or more of body weight compared to 18% of those in the placebo group.

Semaglutide is already FDA-approved to treat obesity in adults after Novo’s Phase III trial showed an average 15% decrease in body weight for those taking semaglutide. This is the drug that the news continues to chat about because celebrities have taken it for weight-loss. Novo’s semaglutide has faced disruptive supply chain issues causing shortages in the drug (this is not due to celebrities taking the medicine… they make up 0.000001% of the population).

AMG133 (Amgen)

Amgen announced their Phase I clinical trial of AMG133 resulted in significant weight-loss compared to placebo participants. The trial enrolled 110 participants to test the safety and optimal dosage of the drug. After 85 days those in the high-dose group lost 15% of their body weight those in the low-dose group lost 7% and those in the placebo group gained 1%. Amgen will start Phase II trials as soon as possible. We’re still waiting for official results in a peer-reviewed journal.

The Future of Obesity Care

With highly-effective anti-obesity medications available or in the pipeline what does the future of obesity management look like? I have three predictions:

Direct-to-consumer (D2C) and business-to-business (B2B) obesity management startups will launch and transform the weight-loss marketplace. Anti-obesity medications will serve as adjuvant therapy in those with severe obesity needing bariatric surgery. Early intervention obesity treatment programs will pop up targeting adolescents with obesity.

The Rise of D2C and B2B Weight-loss Startups

D2C weight-loss startups will continue to pop up offering medical weight-loss treatment with drugs like semaglutide. As more startups launch existing companies will remain competitive by finding ways to lower the cost of semaglutide which is quite unaffordable especially if insurance doesn’t cover it. The most successful companies will offer comprehensive weight-loss management including medical treatment nutritional coaching psychological coaching and fitness coaching. While taking semaglutide alone works wonders a more holistic approach to weight-loss management will likely be more sustainable.

Since semaglutide is largely unaffordable the total addressable market will hit a ceiling if D2C startups can’t sustainably lower the drug’s cost for consumers prompting the rise of B2B companies. These B2B weight-loss startups will target employers and payers promoting healthier employees and beneficiaries resulting in decreased medical spending. Employers and payers will take on more cost-sharing to make drugs like semaglutide affordable. I believe B2B is the way to go instead of D2C especially since we’re seeing a growing trend in the mental health space (e.g. Calm) of originally D2C companies shifting to B2B.

Bariatric Surgery Adjuvant Treatment

Novel anti-obesity medications like semaglutide will become an adjuvant treatment for bariatric surgery. This isn’t my prediction but Dr. John Morton’s a bariatric surgeon and obesity expert at Yale. Earlier this year I said bariatric surgery would die out with the advent of these medications. But opinions can change right? So I agree with Dr. Morton in that bariatric surgery plus semaglutide can serve in much the same way as those undergoing a CABG procedure remain on statins. Therefore I predict bariatric surgery may become even more popular as patients recognize the benefits of the potential combination of the surgery with an effective anti-obesity medication like semaglutide.

Early Obesity Intervention Programs for Adolescents

Early obesity intervention programs will become more prevalent as clinical trials support anti-obesity medications’ efficacy in adolescents. Obesity has compounding effects on the body leading to a five to 20-year decrease in life expectancy. Early intervention is critical.

While these early intervention programs will leverage medical treatment they’ll also incorporate digital health to engage the younger generation better. This will include wearable technology to monitor vitals machine learning technology to track progress and monitor treatment response and social media tools for motivation (e.g. features that show what you may look like if you lose 10 pounds).

Dash’s Dissection

Obesity is a national epidemic affecting two out of five adults and one out of five children and adolescents. As I said earlier obesity has compounding effects on the body. Untreated obesity leads to cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (which itself leads to a range of adverse health effects like renal disease retinopathy and microvascular disease). Given these downstream effects it’s no surprise medical costs for obesity are over $170 billion annually. That’s more than Apple makes in global annual iPhone sales!

I should emphasize that obesity is a chronic degenerative disease. To say obesity is simply caused by “eating too much” and “lack of physical activity” would be naive and ignorant. Obesity pathophysiology is complex which is why these novel medications I discussed are true game changers.

However there are several challenges to achieving what I envision will be the future of obesity management. Foremost insurance companies will do what they can to not cover these novel medications like semaglutide limiting access. They will be stringent with their approvals. Sure the long-term benefits of covering these medications would be cost-effective but a patient seldom sticks with the same insurer throughout their lifespan. So why would one insurer front the costs of an expensive medication if the patient may be off their health plan within a year?

Additionally I imagine access to these novel anti-obesity medications is not made equitable. In that case perverse health disparities will continue to permeate society costing the health system money rather than saving the health system money. For example the obesity rate for non-Hispanic Black adults is 50% while it’s 41% for non-Hispanic White adults. If access to these effective anti-obesity medications is not made equitable then these rates will only move farther apart from each other.

Lastly these effective anti-obesity drugs will inevitably fall into the wrong hands leading to stigma around those taking the medication for appropriate indications. Throughout this article I tried to be careful with my wording when discussing these medications: they’re not weight-loss drugs. They’re anti-obesity drugs. While there is overlap the indication of these drugs is for those with obesity not for people who “just want to shed a couple of pounds for a wedding.” Similar to how Adderall has become stigmatized with the advent of pill-mill startups like Cerebral anti-obesity medications will face a similar fate as more D2C and B2B weight-loss startups pop up.

In summary 2022 was an inflection point in anti-obesity treatment following several clinical trials supporting the efficacy of novel anti-obesity medications. The future of obesity management will be exciting with new startups treatments and public health programs. 2023 may be just as exciting a year for obesity management as 2022.

All experimental investigations were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Pohang University of Science and Technology (approval number: POSTECH-2020-0083) and Samsung Biomedical Research Institute (approval number: 20220509001) and were conducted in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Sprague Dawley male rats (250–350 g 8 weeks old ORIENT Korea) were used in this study.

Design and implementation of the closed-loop feedback stimulation system

The developed closed-loop feedback stimulation system comprised a recording module a stimulation module and custom LabVIEW (National Instruments USA) program for computation (Figs. 1a and 8a). A biosignal sensing analog front-end chip (ADS1299 Texas Instruments USA) and active filter circuitry (implemented with AD8508 Analog Devices USA) were adopted as a measuring device for LFP recording. This module provides simultaneous recording for 8-channels (up to a 16 kS/s sampling rate for each channel with 24-bit resolution and a programmable gain amplifier). The isolated current source in the stimulation device primarily comprised an analog-to-digital converter (DAC8580 Texas Instruments; AD5420 Analog Devices) an operational amplifier (MC34074 ON Semiconductor USA) and several analog multiplexer chips. This stimulator was able to drive voltages up to 14 V with a maximum amplitude of 3 mA and an arbitrary waveform. Both modules were connected to a PC using a microcontroller unit (SAM3X8E Microchip Technology USA) which provides DMA to enable high-speed USB communication. The recorded LFP was processed using custom LabVIEW program to detect electrographic seizures in real-time. When a seizure was detected a trigger signal was delivered to the stimulation module.

Surgical procedure for implantation of the stimulating and recording electrodes

Rats were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane initially and with 1–3% isoflurane in the prone position under a stereotaxic apparatus (68002 RWD Life Science China) during surgery. The body temperature of the anesthetized rats was maintained at 37 °C during surgery with an electronic heating pad. A small midline incision was made to expose the skull then the skull’s surface was cleaned and dried. The bipolar and tripolar electrodes were custom-made with 200 μm diameter polyester-insulated stainless steel wires (Goodfellow UK) and their end-tips were exposed with 400 μm spacing vertically. Depending on the type of stimulation different numbers of burr holes were drilled (Figs. 2a 3a and 5a). In all animals six burr holes were made; two for the reference and ground screw electrodes in the left and right frontal bones respectively; two for the anchor screws in the left and right parietal bones near the coronal bone suture; two for cortex recordings in the front of the left and right lambdoid sutures (all screws had a 1.2 mm diameter). For the non-stimulation and stimulation groups except for the SNF stimulation four custom-made bipolar depth electrodes were bilaterally implanted in the hippocampal region for stimulating and recording (−2.2 mm AP ±2.2 mm ML −3.6 mm DV and −4.5 mm AP ±4.5 mm ML −4.0 mm DV). For the SNF stimulation group four bipolar and four tripolar electrodes were implanted into the hippocampus using the custom-made 3D-printed frame for supporting the depth electrodes (bipolar: −3.0 mm AP ±2.3 mm ML −3.6 mm DV and −3.7 mm AP ±3.4 mm ML −3.6 mm DV; tripolar: −2.2 mm AP ±1.2 mm ML −3.6 mm DV and −4.5 mm AP ±4.5 mm ML −4.0 mm DV). For the SNF stimulation the bipolar electrodes were used for stimulation (one serving as an anode and the other as a cathode) and the tripolar electrodes comprised one pair for stimulation and one for LFP recording. Both the depth and screw electrodes were connected to the connectors and then fixed to the surface of the skull with dental cement. The implanted rats were housed individually during recovery periods.

Preparation of SE model and chronic TLE model with KA injection

To reproduce the key features of human TLE we used the KA-induced seizure model in both acute and chronic conditions. To implement an acute SE rodent model rats were first implanted with the electrodes. Following recovery from the implant surgery the rats were initially anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in the induction chamber. After inducing anesthesia ketamine (80 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected and isoflurane was discontinued to remove the effect of isoflurane anesthesia on neuronal activity. Then the rats received the KA (Hello Bio UK) by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 7 mg/kg of body weight dissolved in 5 mg/mL of normal saline. Finally the rats were moved to the plastic recording cages and connected to the recording and stimulating system for acute experiments.

For chronic seizure induction non-implanted rats were moved to a single cage and then intraperitoneally injected with KA (5 mg/kg) every hour until convulsive motor seizures during SE were observed95969798. A few hours after SE all rats were subcutaneously administered with normal saline and given moistened rat chow then offered a regular diet with monitoring for 4–8 weeks. Rats that developed SRSs were selected for chronic condition experiments and then electrode implantation was performed. After 2-weeks recovery period the rats were moved to the experimental cages and connected to the closed-loop stimulation system.

Recording and processing the electrophysiological activity for electrographic seizure detection

The LFP from both hippocampi (4-channels) and cortex (2-channels) were recorded with a sampling rate of 500 Hz and 1× gain. The signal was passed through a 0.5 Hz high-pass filter to remove the baseline wander. The filtered signal was processed one frame at a time (each frame consisted of 250 samples (0.5 s) with 50% overlap). In the acute experiments the baseline for each subject was computed for 5 min after seizure induction. Seizures were identified using criteria where a power spectral density in a specific band (alpha beta and gamma band respectively) was greater than twice the baseline99100. A stimulus trigger was generated when any of the channel thresholds were met. For the chronic model both frequency properties and spike features were used to detect electrographic seizures while preventing false positives due to motion artifacts in freely moving rats. The power changes in specific frequency bands which was used to detect seizures in the acute trial were computed with the function that actively varies the trigger criteria based on baseline signal in real-time. Spike characteristics including amplitude rate and regularity were calculated with fine-tuning for each individual and used to determine trigger outputs50101102. In addition abnormal patterns such as abnormally large amplitude signals and certain repetitive features due to external artifacts were excluded from the detection process to prevent false alarms. These procedures were equally performed for post-analysis using custom MATLAB (MathWorks USA) scripts to compute factors including the total seizure duration and the success rate of termination. The phase synchrony index was calculated as the phase difference between both hippocampi recorded (Fig. 3b–e and Supplementary Fig. 2a; index R = | < eiΔθ > | Δθ is the phase difference between two signals)103104105.

Induced electric field design for SNF stimulation

Prior to designing and optimizing the electrode configuration the effect of irregularities in the electrical properties of tissues on the electric field formation was first investigated using Sim4Life (Zurich MedTech AG Switzerland) which is specialized in simulating electromagnetic (EM) propagation in a biological structure. The induced field distribution when tissue has heterogeneous electrical conductivities was compared with that of homogeneous condition (Supplementary Fig. 9a b). The conductive values in heterogeneous conditions were randomly determined with an error within 10% of the homogeneous condition (0.7 S/m). The results showed that there was no significant difference in the induced gradients lower than 10% implying that the heterogeneous nature of the tissue in real-world cases would not significantly affect the designed output of field formation under homogeneous condition (Supplementary Fig. 9c d).

Next we pre-defined that the stimulation pulse needs to induce an electric field of at least 100 mV/mm in the target tissue the hippocampus to suppress epileptic rhythms3644 while minimizing off-target spreading fields. No consideration of field orientation for each electrode was given based on the results of previous studies36. In our pilot test we confirmed that delivering stimulation to the ventral hippocampus did not show significant seizure-inhibitory effects like those of the dorsal hippocampus and the direction of electrode activation from dorsal to ventral or vice versa did not affect the therapeutic effects thus the experimental protocol was designed to modulate the dorsal hippocampal region with the stimuli from ventral to dorsal direction (note that the direction of applying the spatiotemporally organized electric field was not important but the unorchestrated field that was induced in random order did not function properly; see Supplementary Fig. 8). EM simulations with varying the position and number of electrodes were performed in compliance with the above considerations (Supplementary Fig. 1). The results showed that as the number of electrodes increased the stimulus intensity required to inhibit seizures decreased while the absolute value of the decreasing slope gradually decreased (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Also it was confirmed that the off-target spreading fields rapidly decreased with the increase in the number of electrodes in SNF stimulation but this effect was finally plateaued when there were >4-pairs (Supplementary Fig. 1c) and additional electrodes were not justified anymore. Thus a 4-pairs configuration was adopted which relatively less causes tissue damage due to electrode insertion and can induce a field sufficient to suppress epileptic networks while minimizing off-target fringing fields with relatively low stimulus intensity.

Stimulation parameters

Based on the report that high-frequency stimulation provides anticonvulsant effects 130 Hz charge-balanced biphasic current pulse stimulation was adopted in this study10106. The pulse width of the stimulus was 300 µs for each (total biphasic pulse width of 600 µs) and no interphase gap. The stimulus pulse was applied for 5 s for each stimulation. The stimulus amplitude was determined as the minimum value indicating anti-seizure effects for each subject via intensity titration with steps of 50 µA (up to 650 and 140 µA for SNF and LIWF stimulation respectively).

Induced electric field measurements

To record the stimulation-induced electric field distribution rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic frame as described in the above surgical procedure. After the skin was retracted with a midsagittal incision 54 holes were drilled on the skull throughout the whole brain region for measurement and four holes were drilled in the right hemisphere for stimulation. Custom-made recording electrode arrays (1.5 mm spacing) were inserted at 54 distinct positions in the brain 1 mm deep below the dura. Four bipolar electrodes for stimulation were implanted using a 3D-printed frame in a similar manner as the montage for SNF stimulation. Each electrode was made by a polyester-insulated stainless steel wire (200 μm diameter). A needle electrode was inserted into the thigh and served as a reference electrode for recording intracerebral electric potentials. Then the recording electrodes were connected to a NI-9220 data acquisition (DAQ) device (National Instruments) and stimulating ones were connected to a custom-made stimulator as described before107.

10 Hz biphasic pulses were delivered through paired electrodes in five configurations (Fig. 4a; WF-stim; R1 R2 R3 and R4 for SNF-stim). The induced electric potentials were recorded for 5 s with no analog filter at a 100 kHz sampling rate per channel. The recorded potentials were averaged for each condition and then peak amplitude for each channel was used to calculate the induced electric fields. Similar to the protocol for measurements in entire brain regions the linear characteristics of spreading fields were further investigated in the left hemisphere using a 10-channel recording electrode array (0.5 mm spacing).

Modeling of the stimulation-induced neural responses

A simplified 3D model of a rodent brain was constructed with the ‘Waxholm Space Atlas of the Sprague Dawley Rat Brain’ (1024 × 512 × 512 voxels with 39 μm resolution)108. Tissue segmentation was conducted by iSEG platform (Zurich MedTech AG) with several image processing such as interpolation and outline correction. Tissue segmentation information including cortex and hippocampus was imported into Sim4Life. Conductivity values were set to 0.0626 (for the brain excluding the hippocampal region) 0.0988 (the hippocampus) 6.62 × 10−7 (polyester) 1.45 × 106 (stainless steel) and 0 (air) S/m respectively109. Next simulations were performed to compute the electric fields induced by a stimulus of 1 mA in both WF and SNF stimulation configurations using the ‘Quasi-static LF solver’.

The cortex somatosensory neuron models (L1 and L2) from the Blue Brain Project (BBP)4041 were implemented into Sim4Life. The model data in the original BBP comprised of “hoc” files were customized to allow for their importation into the simulator. The morphologies and coordinates of the imported neuron models were visualized with the automatic 3D reconstruction internal tool in Sim4Life based on NEURON110 and the positions of neuron models were arranged with GUI tools of Sim4Life placing them in the motor cortex of the customized 3D rat model.

A total of 18 neurons were placed on the M1 region in the 3D rat model. The numerical simulations were performed using the ‘Neuron solver’ in Sim4Life with the WF and SNF stimulation methods. The field intensity for inducing the action potential for each neuron and electrode montage was calculated using the ‘titration procedure’ one of the functions in the Neuron solver. All intensities were normalized to the computed threshold of each SNF stimulation.

Comparing the threshold of the motor response in vivo

To compare the threshold of the motor response of WF and SNF stimulation rats were prepared with configurations for WF and SNF stimulation. The rats were then moved to the experimental cage and connected to the stimulation system via a slip-ring connector to prevent twisting and excessive tension on the cables. We measured the stimulus amplitude that evoked an abnormal motor response (stages 4–5 on a modified Racine scale111) in freely moving rats by applying a stimulus for 1 s. The applied current was sequentially varied from 50 to 800 µA with a 50 µA step and sufficient resting time was provided between each stimulus to prevent the cumulative effects of continuous stimulation.

Experimental details for the acute in vivo stimulation test

All rats with KA injection in acute experiments were randomly divided into seven groups (n = 6 animals for each group); (1) non-stimulation group (2) repetitive timing stimulation group (3) closed-loop unilateral WF stimulation group (4) closed-loop bilateral WF stimulation group (5) closed-loop bilateral LIWF stimulation group (6) closed-loop unilateral SNF stimulation group and (7) closed-loop bilateral SNF stimulation group. All animals were monitored to detect electrographic seizures for 3 h after seizure induction. In the non-stimulation group no action was taken except for monitoring and maintaining anesthesia. In the repetitive timing stimulation group a stimulus current was delivered to both hippocampi every 5 min starting from 10 min after the seizure induction (Fig. 2a b). In the closed-loop WF LIWF and SNF stimulation groups the stimulation module delivered electrical pulses to the hippocampal region when it received a trigger signal from the custom seizure detector. Stimulation pulses were delivered only to the right hippocampus in the unilateral stimulation whereas stimulation pulses were applied to both hippocampi in the bilateral configuration (Figs. 3a and 5a). In the SNF stimulation groups pulses were sequentially applied to the right hippocampus or both hippocampi (Fig. 5a; L1 L2 L3 L4 R4 R3 R2 and R1 in that order; a 100 µs interval between each pulse). Stimulation was continuously applied until the seizure was terminated and a non-stimulation interval of 10 s was set for each stimulus to prevent excessive stimulation. Electrical artifacts could be recorded and disrupt the computation for seizure detection during stimulation thus the seizure detector was turned off when stimulation was in progress.

Immunohistochemical analysis

At 3 h after the KA injection for acute experiments rats were transcardially perfused with saline and their brains were then dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C. Brain tissue was embedded in paraffin and sectioned into 6-µm-thick coronal planes at −3.0 mm AP. To conduct histological analysis of each group Nissl staining (Nissl Stain Kit IHC WORLD UK) and immunohistochemistry with antibodies including c-Fos (ab209794 dilution 1:200 Abcam UK) GAD65 (ab26113 dilution 1:100 Abcam) and Iba1 (ab178846 dilution 1:2000 Abcam) were performed on brain sections. Prior to c-Fos staining pH 6.0 citrate retrieval (ZUC028-500 Zytomed Germany) treatment was performed at 121 °C for 7 min. Anti-mouse (K4001 dilution 1:2000 Agilent DAKO USA) was used as the secondary antibody for c-Fos and GAD65 and anti-rabbit (K4003 dilution 1:2000 Agilent DAKO) was used as the secondary antibody for Iba1. The stained slides were scanned using an Aperio ScanScope AT system (Leica Biosystems USA) and then captured the CA1 CA3 DG and cortex area using the Aperio ImageScope software (Leica Biosystems). Brain tissue with broken brain anatomical landmarks was excluded from the quantitative analysis. ImageJ (National Institutes of Health USA) was used to measure the number of positive cells.

Experimental details for the chronic experiments

Following the chronic seizure induction and electrode implantation procedures animals were monitored 24 h a day to detect electrographic seizures with the algorithm that uses combinations of frequency and spike features. When the specified threshold for intervention was met SNF or LIWF stimulation was immediately applied to the hippocampal region in each stimulated group (the non-stimulated group received no treatment). Stimulation was applied only once for each individual event and a non-stimulation interval was given as 100 s.

Place preference test

A 26 × 42 × 18 cm3 cage was divided into left and right areas of equal size. The rat was offered a period for psychological stability in the cage for 10 min then treated with either SNF or WF stimulation when entering the stimulation zone one of the two sides (repeated interval: 500 ms ON and 500 ms OFF). Stimulus current intensity was randomly assigned from among 0 100 200 and 300 µA in one session. Movement was tracked with a video camera positioned above the center of arena and the place preference ratio was calculated by dividing the time on the simulated side by the total time of the experimental session.

Open field test

To investigate the induction of anxiety-related behavior during SNF and WF stimulation rats were placed in a 40 × 40 × 20 cm3 arena and allowed to freely move around for 5 min. Stimulation intensity was randomly assigned in the same way used in the place preference test. Movement was tracked with a video camera located above the arena.

Statistics and reproducibility

Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise noted. Group comparisons were conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) two-way repeated measures ANOVA or the Kruskal–Wallis test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare two unpaired groups. Two-tailed student’s paired t-test was used to compare pairwise data. Stimulation-induced electric field distributions for each configuration and chronic seizure durations were compared using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. For simplicity P-values < 0.001 were reported as P < 0.001; otherwise P-values were reported as an absolute value. A P-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was conducted using MATLAB with Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

Experiments shown in Figs. 6a c and 7a c and Supplementary Fig. 5c were repeated independently in at least four animals with similar results (exact numbers as indicated in figure legends respectively).

Meta’s Ballsbridge campus would include Fibonacci Square four sentinel-like office blocks fronting on to Merrion Road. On these blocks alone it would be paying €45 million a year in rent. The entire complex which includes a further two large offices was valued at well over €1 billion. At the same time AIB was scattering operations to save money: Dublin city centre for the top brass and Sandyford for the foot soldiers.

According to one former company executive however Jobs wouldn’t have gotten as far as he did without some assistance from Tim Cook who served as executive vice president for worldwide sales and operations and is now CEO of the company.

“While I’m in no position to comment on many things about [Jobs] the journey of [Jony] Ive and Tim Cook and others the closest to him as an outsider when people would ask me I’d say ‘if it weren’t for Tim Cook Steve wouldn’t have succeeded or Jony Ive” Satjiv Chahil former marketing chief at Apple told Yahoo Finance (video above).

The reason for that Chahil explained was because operationally the company was “always a disaster.”

“Products wouldn’t show up” he said. “Some wouldn’t work. They’d land in the wrong country.”

When Cook was asked by Jobs to join Apple in 1998 he initially served as senior vice president for worldwide operations. One of his first major moves was closing factories and warehouses around the world instead opting to establish relationships with contract manufacturers.

As a result according to CNN Business “Apple’s inventory measured by the amount of time it sat on the company’s balance sheet quickly fell from months to days.”

Cook also helped spearhead early company investments into flash memory which helped Apple create its initial products like the iPod Nano.

“Ever since [Jobs] got Tim Cook they’re like a machine” Chahil said. “The products always landed in the end. In companies the unsung heroes are the operation guys who make everything work. But there’s nothing brilliantly new that hit.”

Cook became lead operations in 2007 then filled in the chief executive role in 2009 when Jobs took his first medical leave of absence. Two years later he took the helm once more when Jobs was forced to take another medical leave due to cancer. Cook became in charge of Apple’s operations keeping the ship afloat for Jobs in the meantime.

Chahil never worked directly with Jobs during his stint at Apple but praised the company’s founder as “the greatest communicator there was.”

“He knew how to present ideas product — he knew how to catch the imagination of people” Chahil said. “So I always thought of him as the chief imagination officer.”

Below see the responses of the companies that chose to comment.

Bosch

""Bosch is committed to ensuring that its products are not produced wholly or in part by forced labor. Regarding the XUAR Bosch does not mine produce or manufacture products in that region. Materials and components from our direct suppliers also are not mined produced or manufactured at sites in the XUAR.

""We have carefully scrutinized our supplier relationships and came to the conclusion that — contrary to what has been stated elsewhere — we had no partnership or supply relationship whatsoever with the company named in this context.""

BYD

""BYD does not use forced labor in its supply chain. BYD maintains a strict Corporate Social Responsibility Policy that it enforces throughout its supply chain. BYD is an industry leader in corporate responsibility and enforces rigorous oversight of its entire supply chain. BYD has implemented cutting-edge corporate social responsibility policies which apply not only to itself but also to its suppliers. In order to ensure the proper implementation of its CSR policies BYD regularly conducts labor audits of suppliers in accordance with the BYD Company Audit Management Rules. The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy is available online at https://en.byd.com/ corporate-social- responsibility .""

""BYD is a clean transportation and renewable energy company headquartered in Los Angeles CA and Shenzhen China. BYD makes a wide range of electric buses (including for public transit) and trucks at its 500000 sq. ft California bus production facility where hundreds are employed with good union jobs and protections. BYD's industry leading zero-emissions battery-electric buses trucks and forklifts are hard at work every day in a variety of mission critical applications throughout the United States and we're incredibly proud of the fact that our products and services help power America's green transition.""

Puma

""After we became aware of the report of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) in March 2020 we ordered an immediate investigation of our supply chain in China with regards to potential forced labor issues.

""Our analysis has shown that the allegations made against PUMA as they were made in the 'Uyghurs for Sale' report were incorrect. Forced labor does not occur in PUMA's value chain. PUMA has no direct or indirect business relationship with manufacturers in Xinjiang the province in Western China where the Uyghurs live.

""Compliance with human rights labor rights and environmental standards is a top priority at PUMA and has been specified in our Codes of Conduct for over 20 years.""

Alstom/Bombardier (Alstom acquired Bombardier in 2021. Both companies provided a comment and were considered separate companies for counting purposes.)

Alstom: ""Following the publication of the ASPI report Alstom and ex-Bombardier Transportation (BT) have undertaken a review of potential forced labour issues in the KTK Group factories supplying Alstom and ex-BT. Based on the scope and methodology of the audit the documentation and information received from the Supplier and external audits undertaken no human rights incidents were identified at the plant that supplies Alstom.

Bombardier: ""Conducting business with integrity and the highest ethical standards is a top priority for Bombardier. Our company upholds this commitment by following a rigorous Supplier code of conduct which strictly prohibits the use of forced or compulsory labour in any of our operations or by our business partners. Bombardier considers the respect of human rights to be a fundamental corporate responsibility and a crucial value we carry in all of our activities.""

The company also pointed to a previous statement.

Esquel Group

""Esquel has never and will never use forced or coerced labor. We morally oppose the use of forced labor which is completely contrary to our principles and the business practices by which we have operated for more than 40 years. We remain one of the few companies in the textile and apparel sector that is vertically integrated and able to provide our customers end-to-end traceability and extensive documentation on where they source their cotton.""

Alstom (Alstom completed its acquisition of Bombardier in 2021)

""Following the publication of the ASPI report Alstom and ex-Bombardier Transportation (BT) have undertaken a review of potential forced labour issues in the KTK Group factories supplying Alstom and ex-BT.

""Based on the scope and methodology of the audit the documentation and information received from the Supplier and external audits undertaken no human rights incidents were identified at the plant that supplies Alstom.""

Siemens

""To state it very clearly: respecting human rights is of immense importance to our company and an integral part of our responsibility as a global business. As stated in our Business Conduct Guidelines we reject all forms of oppression forced labor and participation in human rights violations. Siemens has no manufacturing facilities in the Xinjiang province and does not produce there.""

""Regarding our suppliers: We take the respect for human rights very seriously and as a general principle all Siemens suppliers must commit themselves to comply with our 'Code of Conduct' for Suppliers. This code is the basis for supplier selection and qualification. Siemens cooperates exclusively with suppliers who are committed to combating forced labor — and this applies globally. In addition the auditing of our suppliers includes the topic of 'respect of human rights' and explicitly mentions 'the prohibition of forced labor.'""

Japan Display Inc.

""After finding the report we immediately conducted a fact-finding investigation but did not find evidence that those suppliers were involved in the forced labor. Although no evidence was found at the investigation we later received a report from the primary supplier that they had terminated business with the second-tier supplier in August 2020 and the third-tier supplier in October 2020 and started using other suppliers. We have confirmed this transition of suppliers and will continue to monitor their labor practices on an ongoing basis.""



""We require compliance from all of our suppliers to the 'JDI Supply Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook' and require them to audit and report their CSR compliance via the JDI

Suppliers CSR Self-Audit Checklist.

""Also in the JDI standard procurement contract we prohibit all suppliers from using forced labor and also require the entire supply chain including the second- and third-tier suppliers and contractors to the suppliers to comply with JDI's CSR principles and confirm the status of this compliance. We will continue to respect human rights and take a strong stand against forced labor.""



Jaguar

""As a global company with a global footprint Jaguar Land Rover is committed to ensuring our entire supply chain upholds our corporate sustainability and social responsibility standards.

Mesh domains used in FE modeling are collections of connected geometrical elements (such as lines triangles quadrilaterals tetrahedra) defining solids surfaces or lines. The boundary value problem is often defined by the physical quantities of interest (such as displacement and stress) at specific locations on the boundary of the elements namely nodes (usually coincident with vertices). Considering the mesh only composed of nodes connected through edges we identify mesh domains with computational graphs \(G=(VE)\) where V represents a set of N nodes connected to each other through M edges (E). The i-th node (in V) brings n features in the vector \(v_i\) (such as nodal coordinates and base material properties); similarly the edge (in E) connecting the i-th and j-th node has a m-dimensional feature vector \(e_{ij}\) (such as distance between nodes). As illustrated in Fig. 1 our model addresses the problem of predicting displacement (\(u_i\)) stress (\(\sigma _i\)) and strain (\(\varepsilon _i\)) fields (at the graph nodes) in material and structural systems such as representative volume elements (RVEs) and finite-size lattice structures. Given the flexibility of the graph representation all the factors that determine the material’s mechanical response i.e. geometry/topology (\({\textbf{g}}\)) base materials behavior (\({\textbf{m}}\)) and boundary conditions (\(\mathbf {\text {BC }}\)) can be encoded into the node and edge features and graph connectivity (as next shown for three material systems).

Model description

GNNs is a class of deep neural networks that operate directly on graph data (i.e. non-Euclidean data) instead of vectorized or image-data55. In our work we develop an encoder-decoder ML model to approximate the relationship (f in Fig. 1) between material and structural characteristics and conditions and physical fields (displacement stress and strain). Our model consists of three components the Encoder the Message Passing and the Decoder (Fig. 1). From the graph representation of the material system the Encoder encodes the node and edge features into a latent space (of larger dimension d) using the neural networks \(\epsilon ^N\) and \(\epsilon ^E\) at each node and edge respectively. These encoded features are processed by the Message Passing module which aggregates first information from the neighborhood of each node (through the neural network \(M^E\)) and then updates the node state using the neural network \(U^N\); these two operations represent a message pass. After L message passes the latent node features are transformed by the neural network \(\delta ^N\) (i.e. the Decoder) into the field outputs. The model is trained by supervising on nodal physical quantities (i.e. \(u_i\) \(\sigma _i\) \(\varepsilon _i\)) obtained by FE simulations (ground truth). Overall the GNN model takes a graph representing the material system as input and outputs physical fields. As measures to evaluate the model performance we use the error map defined as the nodal difference between the ground truth and predictions and the mean absolute error MAE. Moreover to measure the ability of the model of predicting derivative material properties we use the mean relative error for the constitutive stress-strain response of the whole RVE (when the stress field evolution is studied). More details are provided in Methods and Supplementary Materials.

Our trained ML model can predict complex mechanical phenomena such as wrinkling of thin interfacial layers and buckling instability of lattice materials linking the geometry/topology the base material properties and the loading conditions to the deformation stress and strain fields. Learning physical relationships between deformation and stress (or strain) fields from data the model predicts realistic global mechanical behavior even when input information is not enough to capture the actual local phenomenon (e.g. the eigen-modes are not provided as input for post-buckling predictions). Indeed attempting to minimize the global MAE the average behavior is more easily captured by the model in the absence of data related to the considered physical phenomenon (next evidence is provided). To demonstrate the power of deep GNNs to learn and predict the physics of complex mechanical phenomena in different classes of materials and structures in the following sections we report three different problems solved by our ML model in order of increasing complexity.

Learning a class of composite materials

Here we focus on traditional unidirectional fiber composite materials subjected to plain strain uniaxial tensile loading. For simplicity of conveying the key ideas of our method a grid-like periodic fiber distribution is considered by analyzing a single-fiber RVE (representing the microstructure) as shown in Fig. 2AB. Two constituent materials compose the material microstructure the hard phase (i.e. fiber) and soft phase (i.e. matrix). The fiber has linear elasticity whereas the matrix has elasto-plastic (J2 plasticity) behavior. To simulate high-contrast material discontinuity in terms of Young’s modulus the hard phase is 10 times stiffer than the soft phase (see Methods). Fully characterizing the microstructure’s geometry the volume fraction of the fiber \(f_v\) is employed as the only independent geometric parameter g; for each value of \(f_v\) it is associated a unique fiber’s radius (Fig. 2A shows different microstructures). Linearly sampling \(f_v\) in the range 0.05–0.5 a dataset of 500 microstructures is generated then split into 90 \(\%\) of training data and 10 \(\%\) of test data (sensitivity analysis with training data density reported in Fig. S12). Imposing periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) on the boundaries of each RVE (see Methods) the displacement \(u_i=(u_i^1u_i^2)\) and stress \(\sigma _i= (\sigma _i^{11}\sigma _i^{22}\sigma _i^{33}\sigma _i^{12})\) fields obtained from FE simulations are regarded as the ground truth for the ML model’s output. The model’s input geometric information g of the microstructure is encoded into the graph topology (through the node connectivity) and the node and edge features. Specifically undeformed nodal coordinates \(x_i\) and node type \(\xi _i\) (equals 0 for matrix 1 for fiber) are encoded into the node features \(v_i\). Relative distance between the i-th and j-th node \(x_{ij}=x_i-x_j\) in the undeformed configuration and its absolute value \(|x_{ij}|\) are encoded into the edge features \(e_{ij}\).

A typical RVE with the corresponding macroscopic stress-strain curve from the test dataset is shown in Fig. 2B. To demonstrate the ML model’s capability of capturing the small and finite deformation and stress field in fiber composites in Fig. 2C-D we report the comparison between the FE simulations (ground truth) and model predictions for two macroscopic applied strain values \({\overline{\varepsilon }}\)= 1 and 6 \(\%\) (model trained separately). An average MAE of \(\sim\) 0.02 and 0.04 is obtained on the test data (i.e. 50 microstructures) for the elastic and plastic regime respectively. The deformation of the microstructure is accurately predicted by our ML model as depicted in Fig. 2C for the plastic regime. Analogously the ML predicted stress components \(\sigma _{11}\sigma _{22}\sigma _{33}\) distributions shown in Fig. 2D greatly resemble the numerical simulations for both strain regimes. The accuracy of the predictions is further confirmed by the error map which additionally identifies the small local regions with larger errors (mostly close to the fiber-matrix boundary of high stress and strain gradient as in48) contributing to accuracy drops. Remarkably also complex stress patterns as for the shear stress \(\sigma _{12}\) with low amplitude (compared to the main component \(\sigma _{11}\)) are captured by our predictions as shown in Fig. S2. Deformation and stress field comparisons for other RVEs in the test dataset are reported in Fig. S3 and S4. While often equivalent stress distributions such as von Mises stress are adopted as single output4548 our model learns not only the whole stress tensor (i.e. multiple components) field but also the corresponding deformed shape (Fig. 2C). Learning the mechanics of microstructures with different fiber’s radii (thus volume fraction) the proposed model can thus accurately predict the small and finite deformation and stress field in both dilute and dense fiber-reinforced composites.

Analogous results for the shear stress field (\(\sigma _{12}\)) are reported in Supplementary Materials. Full size image

Deformation and stress field evolution

In the earlier results on fiber composite microstructures the ML model was trained separately for different levels of macroscopic applied strain. Here we investigate whether our model can simultaneously learn multiple loading steps at different magnitudes i.e. the evolution of deformation and stress field. To demonstrate the ability of the model to predict large local deformations we first consider the same previous dataset but subject to displacement boundary conditions (instead of PBCs). In this way harnessing the graph structure of the mesh to inform the ML model on the boundary conditions a vector \(u_i^{\mathbf {\text {BC }}}=(u_i^{(1\mathbf {\text {BC }})}0)\) representing the applied displacement on the i-th node is introduced as additional node feature (i.e. \(\mathbf {\text {BC }}\) in Fig. 1) . To further reduce the computational cost for training data generation and model training a coarser mesh and linear elasticity are here adopted and only 100 total data are considered. Without the hypothesis of plasticity the macroscopic stress-strain responses are linear (less complex); this hence reduces the amount of required training data. Five loading steps are linearly sampled in the range 1–8 \(\%\) of effective applied strain (ratio between the applied displacement and the RVE’ size) for each microstructure treating the temporal variable (i.e. loading steps) as a parametrization of the data distribution i.e. a sequence of graphs. In addition to make the approach more general (for future applications on path-dependent problems) we insert two recurrent layers after the message-passing module interpreting the latent node features as hidden states (Methods) finally transformed to output fields by the decoder (Fig. 1). An average MAE of \(\sim\) 0.07 is obtained on the test data (average over all the microstructures and steps) and a remarkable resemblance between the ML predictions and FE simulations is achieved as shown in Fig. S5 and Movie S1. The large transversal (to the loading direction) deformations of the microstructure are captured by our model confirming that GNNs can predict smooth surface deformations with accuracy close to that of high-fidelity FE solvers.

Moreover to test the capability of the model to predict physical responses on unseen applied strains  five additional loading steps are sampled in the applied strain range (1–8 %) with a total of ten applied strain levels. The model trained only on five steps is tested against all the ten strains. The result is shown in Movie S2 where the \(\sigma _{11}\) stress component is displayed; an average MAE of \(\sim\) 0.07 is obtained as before. Analogous results not shown here for the sake of brevity hold by sampling the strain range by an arbitrary number of loading steps (we tested up to 25) and training the model only on a few of them. The model can thus accurately predict the selected physical fields on different loading steps from the five training ones (spanning all the applied strain range). This approach may be helpful to reduce the amount of required training data for fields evolution prediction. Indeed by training the model on a few time steps it would be able to predict the fields evolution also for unseen strain levels in between.

To further demonstrate that our model can accurately predict derivative material properties from more complex stress fields linear hardening plasticity is here introduced for the matrix of the composite together with PBCs (more details in Methods). These latter are represented as additional node features \(\varepsilon _i^{\mathbf {\text {BC }}}\) being the applied macroscopic strain component (BC in Fig. 1). The model is trained on ten loading steps and it is tested on 25 levels of strains in the same range (0–8 %). In Fig. 3 the predicted and simulated stress-strain responses of two RVEs with different fiber volume fractions as well as the mean relative error distributions on the test dataset are reported for the two non-zero macroscopic stress components (average over the RVE). Although higher average MAE values (\(\sim\) 0.10) for the physical fields are obtained the macroscopic predictions are virtually indistinguishable from the simulated responses exhibiting maximum relative errors below 3.5 and 7.5 % for the components \(\sigma _{11}\) amd \(\sigma _{33}\) respectively (Fig. 3). In addition without inputting the information of plain strain uniaxial tension into the GNN model the predicted macroscopic stresses are consistent with such applied condition. Accordingly the model predicts the stress components \(\sigma _{22}\) and \(\sigma _{12}\) to be zero with a scatter below 1 % of the peak of the dominant component \(\sigma _{11}\).

Overall the performance of our GNN models on the two datasets comprising only elastic phases with larger deformations or more complex linear hardening plasticity seem to be promising. However we observe that the mean errors of field evolution (\(\sim\) 0.07–0.10) are higher than those of separate predictions (\(\sim\) 0.02–0.04) i.e. model trained on a specific macroscopic strain. For the elastic case only 90 microstructures (90:10 training-test data ratio) each with five loading steps are employed as training data resulting in a really small dataset thus limiting the maximum accuracy. For the plastic case 450 microstructures each with ten loading steps are used; however the additional complexity of linear hardening plasticity (characterizing the matrix) introduces a path-dependent physics calling for more data. To understand the trade-off between the predictive performance and training costs we report a sensitivity analysis in Fig. S12 showing that not only the average MAE but also the scatter decreases with larger training datasets. Owing to the large graphs involved (mesh-to-graph mapping) future works may thus focus on ways to reduce such graph size providing a way to exploit larger training datasets.

Wrinkling of interfacial layers

Although stress and strain fields in material systems with variable base material composition exhibiting complex behavior could reasonably be predicted by pixel-based ML models using high resolution images454748 accurately predicting also complex deformed shapes would be computationally costly. To face this challenge using our GNN model as an example we focus here on the formation of wrinkled interfaces (i.e. instability) in soft layered composites56. The stratified composite (Fig. 4A) is composed of thin hard interfacial layers of thickness t periodically arranged at distance d and embedded in a soft matrix; both phases have linear elasticity with Young’s modulus \(E_0\) and \(E_1\) for the soft and hard phase respectively. Assuming periodic geometric pattern we consider an RVE of size d (inset of Fig. 4A) subjected to plain strain uniaxial compression with applied macroscopic strain \({\overline{\varepsilon }}\)= 9 \(\%\) under PBCs (see Methods). As already known the layer instability is governed by the distance-to-thickness ratio d/t Young’s moduli ratio \(E_1\)/\(E_0\) and matrix’ Poisson’s ratio \(

u _0\)56. To verify whether our model can learn a relation between the base materials properties \(m=(E

u )\) and displacement and strain fields \((u_i \varepsilon _i)\) we keep the geometric parameter g = d/t constant (avoiding long-wave instability56) while varying \(E_1\)/\(E_0\) and \(

u _0\) in the range 50–1000 and 0.01–0.49 respectively. Linearly sampling 100 values for \(E_1\)/\(E_0\) and 5 values for \(

u _0\) a dataset of 500 configurations (i.e. total combinations) is then constructed and split into 90 \(\%\) of training data and 10 \(\%\) of test data (sensitivity analysis with training data density reported in Fig. S12). The base materials information is naturally encoded into the node features substituting the previously used node type \(\xi _i\) with m for each node.

The compressed interfacial layer tends to deform into a wavy pattern upon the onset of buckling instability as shown in Fig. 4B. For different layer and matrix properties various wavy deformed shapes and strain field amplitudes are exhibited (see Fig. S6). Here the most challenging task is capturing the complex wavy patterns (i.e. amplitude and wavelength of the deformed shape) and strain contours (i.e. spatial distribution and local amplitude) upon buckling of the interfacial layer for different base material properties. Indeed as the phenomenon becomes more complex and larger deformations occur the ML model struggles to have similar low MAE values on the test dataset as those of the previous example (fiber composites). Nonetheless a non-uniform distribution of MAE values (both for training and test dataset) is exhibited (Fig. S7). Most of the predictions exhibit low MAE as shown in Fig. 4C closely resembling the FE simulated wavy patterns as well as the strain distributions. The average MAE value (on the test dataset) of \(\sim 0.22\) can be explained by highly localized mismatches in the strain field amplitude in a few regions close to the interface (error map in Fig. 4C) and in the wavy deformed shape for some test configurations (Figs. S7–S8). Specifically almost independently of \(

u _0\) the MAE of the predictions on the whole dataset tends to be smaller for microstructures with higher \(E_1\)/\(E_0\) corresponding to long-wavelength high-amplitude wavy patterns (Fig. S7). These results suggest that complexity rather than largeness of the deformation limits the accuracy of predictions. Despite predicting the wrong wavy pattern (i.e. wavelength) for low stiffness ratios the trained ML model tends to learn a relationship between the curvature of the interfacial layer and the strain distribution (Fig. S8). For each strain component positive and negative strains are associated to the concavity of the wavy pattern (Fig. S8). Considering for example the components \(\varepsilon _{11}\) and \(\varepsilon _{22}\) in Fig. S8 although the predicted wavelength does not match the real one the tensile and compressive regions in the composite matrix are qualitatively well captured based on the layer concavity. To better evaluate our predictions in Fig. 4D we compare the FE simulated and ML predicted wrinkled meshed interfaces. Although deviations of the predicted deformation from the smooth numerical solution exist (inset in Fig. 4D) the two meshes globally overlap indicating that the amplitude and wavelength of the post-buckled shape of the layer are accurately predicted by the ML model. This example demonstrates that GNNs which allow resolution increase close to regions where the local phenomenon is expected to occur can accurately capture localized complex phenomena just in a purely data-driven supervised setting. For future research we argue that smoothness in the ML predicted solution might be enforced by introducing physical constraints into the GNN model increasing accuracy and generalizability. To investigate if an image-based ML model can similarly solve this problem using the same dataset we implement a U-Net (recently adopted for heterogeneous materials with variable base material properties48) and report the results in Fig. S9. After several empirical tests performed by varying the perceptive field (increasing the kernel size the dilation step and network’s depth) the U-Net model tends to predict uniform strain fields (on the three components) with a relatively low average MAE of \(\sim\) 0.07 yet without capturing any local deformation. These results suggest that a GNN framework can not only predict highly localized phenomena for composites with variable base material properties but also reduce the need of training data compared to image-based ML models.

Compression of architected metamaterials

While image representations are generally effective to represent fully dense material systems such as those previously analyzed they are not when dealing with architected metamaterials with low volume fraction such as lattice structures in which the solid phase is sparsely distributed. These structures are instead more naturally suitable for graph representation. As an example here we exploit our GNN model to predict the deformation and stress field in finite-size lattice structures under compressive loading (Fig. 5AB). Based on a bottom-up generation procedure featured in our previous work57 a dataset of 762 structures is constructed with 2 \(\times\) 2 tessellations of randomly generated unit cells (Supplementary Materials) and split as before in training and test dataset (sensitivity analysis with training data density reported in Fig. S12). The lattice structures are composed of incompressible hyperelastic beams with initial shear modulus \(\mu\) and uniform thickness t and have constant volume fraction \({\overline{\rho }}\). Separately trained on two different deformation regimes i.e. small and large deformations the ML model is characterized by different node and edge features and output. For small deformations only the nodal coordinates of the undeformed mesh (10 beam-elements per beam) are encoded into the node features and analogous edge features as before are here adopted; the output is represented by the displacement field \(u_i\) and axial stress \(\sigma _i= \sigma _i^a\) along the beams. For large deformations accounting for local buckling the critical eigen-mode coordinates \(\tilde{x_i}\) are additionally encoded into the node features and the corresponding node-to-node distances (\(\tilde{x_{ij}}\) and \(|\tilde{x_{ij}}|\)) are included into the edge features; only the displacement field is output by the model. More details are provided in Methods and Supplementary Materials.

To demonstrate our ML model can learn the compressive behavior of non-uniform lattice structures for small and large deformations in Fig. 5CD we report the FE simulated and ML predicted stress distribution \(\sigma _i^a\) for small effective strain (\({\overline{\varepsilon }}=0.1 \%\)) and deformed shapes after the onset of buckling instability (\({\overline{\varepsilon }}=3 \%\)) for three different architectures randomly sampled from the test dataset (see Fig. S10 for other lattices). In the elastic regime the stress field is overall captured by our model with MAE values \(\sim 0.29\) (Fig. 5C). Carrying most of the load through the beams aligned with the loading direction the lattice structures are mainly stressed along the horizontal direction (x-direction). Predicting this behavior thus suggests that the ML model effectively learns the mechanics of the structure under compressive loading. The error map in Fig. 5C confirms these results except for a few localized regions mainly represented by the lattice junctions where the stress concentrations tend to be smoothed by the ML model to reduce the overall loss. This limitation however does not impact the prediction of the overall mechanical behavior of the structure without considering local cracking and damage mechanisms beyond the scope of this example. Upon reached the critical applied displacement the structure locally buckles and localizes the deformation transversally to the loading direction (Fig. 5B). The global displacement (thus the stiffness) of the structure is captured by the ML model as shown in Fig. 5D. Despite the highly localized nonlinear deformation converging to MAE values \(\sim 0.39\) on the test dataset the ML model can also predict the complex post-buckled deformed shape with satisfactory approximation (Fig. 5D). The mismatch between the predicted and simulated beams’ local deformations together with the good approximation of the global structure displacement suggests that the model trying to minimize the overall error gets stuck in a local minimum during training. We expect that much larger training datasets and physics constraints in the model could reduce such local mismatch. We also notice that without using the critical eigen-mode information as input the model is prone to converge to the un-buckled deformed configuration while properly predicting the global displacement (Fig. S11). This observation suggests that the GNN model tends to learn actual physical relationships between the given inputs and outputs (Fig. 1).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25vd25ld3MuY29tL2hlYWx0aC9zY2llbnRpc3RzLWRpc2NvdmVyLWFuLWFudGktYmFjdGVyaWFsLWFudGktdmlyYWwtY3JhbmJlcnJ5LWNvbG91cmVkLWxpcHN0aWNrLWFydGljbGUtOTYzMDIxMjDSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGltZXNub3duZXdzLmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvc2NpZW50aXN0cy1kaXNjb3Zlci1hbi1hbnRpLWJhY3RlcmlhbC1hbnRpLXZpcmFsLWNyYW5iZXJyeS1jb2xvdXJlZC1saXBzdGljay1hcnRpY2xlLTk2MzAyMTIwL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scientists discover an anti-bacterial anti-viral cranberry-coloured lipstick,"The deep-red coloured lipstick inactivates disease-causing viruses bacteria and a fungus that come in contact with it

Washington: Lipstick can improve confidence complement an outfit and keep lips from chapping. However sharing a tube with a friend or family member can spread illnesses. Researchers from ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces added cranberry extract to the formulation to create a version with antibacterial characteristics.

Their deep red cream quickly inactivates disease-causing viruses bacteria and a fungus that come in contact with it.

According to historians people in ancient Egypt were the first to use make-up applying pastes made from minerals and other substances in their environment. The formulations have evolved over the centuries but now researchers have come full circle looking again toward natural ingredients.

For example recent studies have reported that lipstick formulas incorporating natural colorants such as red dragon fruit can result in products with both vibrant colors and antimicrobial activity. And previously cranberry extract has been shown to inactivate viruses bacteria and fungi.

So Angel Serrano-Aroca and colleagues wanted to use cranberry extract to create a deep red lip tint with antimicrobial properties.

The research team mixed cranberry extract into a lipstick cream base which contained shea butter vitamin E provitamin B5 babassu oil and avocado oil. In experiments reddened cream was added to cultures containing different viruses bacteria and one fungal species.

Both enveloped and non-enveloped virus types were completely inactivated within a minute of contact with the cranberry-containing cream. And the multidrug-resistant bacteria mycobacteria and fungus were substantially inactivated within five hours of applying the cream.

The researchers suggest that their novel lipstick formula could offer protection against a variety of disease-causing microorganisms.

And second because it encourages me to tap into a younger version of myself who sometimes still can’t believe that he has the opportunity to collaborate with the New York Knicks. As a designer I find that my best work is produced from a place of reverence and nostalgia and some of my fondest memories as a kid are attending Knicks games with my mom. With this new collection specifically I think that youthful adoration for my favorite team is reflected throughout.”

Styles from the New York or Nowhere x Knicks collection.

This is the fourth collaboration between the Knicks and New York or Nowhere. The first one made the streetwear brand the number two bestselling label at Madison Square Garden and the pieces were seen on the likes of Lindsay Lohan Amy Schumer Rachel Brosnahan and others.

The Knicks collaboration comes after New York or Nowhere opened its first permanent flagship store in NoLIta this fall. Through the store the brand is expanding from apparel to also offer home goods.

The New York Knicks x New York or Nowhere collaboration will be available to purchase starting Tuesday at the New York or Nowhere store and on its website as well as at Madison Square Garden and its website. Products range in price from $15 to $150.

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

As such there are stringent qualifications one must meet to qualify. Here is a breakdown of the requirements:

If you are a crypto enthusiast and are into crypto apps  chances are you have already heard of Binance the leading crypto exchange platform in the world since 2018. What you have probably missed out on is that they have an especially rewarding affiliate program that you can apply for to earn money.

With the basics of affiliate marketing and its ways in the metaverse already tackled it’s now time to get to know some good examples of affiliate marketing programs you can look into for inspiration. If you are planning on setting up one for yourself or if you are an affiliate who wants to continuously earn through affiliate marketing don’t miss out on what’s coming.

Probably the most notable difference when marketing as an affiliate in the metaverse is the way an affiliate is paid. Here there are different options—the usual dollar or currency through a digital asset such as crypto or through a built-in or native currency that the platform you are partnering with uses.

The good thing about promoting in the metaverse using affiliate marketing is that it still keeps the same premise in the conventional manner of the strategy. An affiliate working in the metaverse can either move about in a virtual world where other consumers interact or be in another VR social media platform to recommend a product to their followers.

While affiliate marketing in the general picture is an efficient way to endorse a product doing it in the metaverse is something that has yet to be explored. However this does not mean that affiliate marketing in the metaverse is a hopeless case as both the metaverse and affiliate marketing are filled with potential individually and together they might possibly be the future of marketing.

With the growing influence of social media affiliate marketing has become a viable option for both marketers and affiliates to earn more. Tiktok Facebook Instagram Youtube and even personal blogs are the most commonly used platforms to facilitate affiliate marketing and the user-recommendation strategy has grown to be effective in marketing a product across varying platforms other than an online store.

Affiliate marketing is one of the leading marketing strategies today as it uses the help of a person called an “affiliate” to market the product by recommending it to others. In return the affiliate earns a percentage from each sale of the product otherwise known as a commission.

Business owners and marketers are eager to take full advantage of the opportunities the metaverse has to offer  and affiliate marketing is the modern solution that proves to be effective in achieving such a goal. But not every affiliate marketing program can be efficiently utilized in the metaverse so here are some examples that might actually be worth your time and money.

In general an affiliate can earn 41% worth of commission for every successful signup done on a spot trading. Once the count exceeds 500 the percentage of commission is increased to 50%. With these rates and effective marketing both Binance and an affiliate can mutually gain influence and sustain profits.

While this is more of a crypto affiliate program than a metaverse affiliate program you should consider that Binance allows you to trade NFTs which are the foundations of the metaverse as well as all other cryptos and metaverse-native tokens and currencies. So by promoting these types of assets and Binance in general you are in fact promoting the metaverse.

2. Aftermath Islands referral program

Aftermath Islands is a “blockchain-based virtual reality interactive platform” that allows users to purchase trade as well as develop virtual lands and other properties as non-fungible tokens or NFTs. They are best known for their themed islands where users can interact and communicate.

Like many affiliate programs the Aftermath Islands Referral Program gives an affiliate a commission as a percentage of every sale. It is both an affiliate and referral program as the condition requires you to be a user of the program itself to qualify.

When qualified an affiliate can earn either through Aftermath Island’s own currency which they call points or through the usual channels such as Paypal in regular fiat currency. It’s worth noting though that for this payment method the waiting time is 60 days before the payout can be made.

Quick Fact: The Aftermath Islands Referral Program has a tier system of bronze silver and gold status and an affiliate can earn 10% 15% and 20% commission on every sale respectively. Additionally commissions will be cut down by half if you choose to redeem them for cash and you need to meet a certain amount of sales to be able to jump from one tier to another ($1000 worth of sales to move from bronze to silver and $5000 to be a gold status affiliate).

3. Second Life affiliate program

If you are looking to study an affiliate program that has been in the metaverse for quite some time the Second Life affiliate program is the best choice. While it has received a surge of new users in the last year Second Life is actually one of the first metaverses to ever exist.

Second Life’s affiliate program works like any other previously discussed programs and it’s even easier for an affiliate to start earning as they can still get a commission for every successful sign-up with their 7-day free trial.

For the moment though Second Life’s affiliate program seems to be paused indefinitely since April 1st of this year. There’s still no news as to when the program will resume but many have raised speculations that this is due to the fact that Second Life’s affiliate program works with Commission Junction a platform specialising in affiliate marketing but that has since garnered only negative reviews.

4. Autodesk affiliate program

Virtual reality is a major component of the metaverse and 3D design animation and rendering software are its lifeblood. Autodesk the world’s leading design software company for architecture construction and entertainment industries has played a big part in the establishment of augmented realities to help the metaverse come about.

While they have certainly taken the lead in their respective industry for design Autodesk still aims to expand their network of influence through their own affiliate program especially because most of their services are paid. To be able to qualify for the program you just have to apply with CJ affiliate to get started.

As stated the requirements to be an Autodesk affiliate are much easier to comply with if you plan on applying and here are the benefits one can enjoy if they do get accepted into the program:

9% commission on all successful products sold

Cookie duration of 60 days

Full product data feed available

Affiliate Newsletter updates on new promotions product releases and more

Ability to promote products across geographies

Dedicated Affiliate Manager to assist you

Autodesk also has a recommendation for newbie affiliate marketers on which products they can start endorsing on their respective platforms among them being Autocad Autocad LT 3DS Max Fusion 360 Inventor Lt Maya Maya LT Revit and Autocad Revit LT Suite.

5. VR Sync affiliate program

VR Sync is a synchronization software that gives its users the ability to experience a synchronised 360 video playback across an unlimited number of Virtual Reality devices. From the name itself and the nature of the service they offer VR Sync is closely related to the front end that powers the metaverse.

VR Sync’s affiliate program promises its successful applicants a commission rate of 30% for every successful conversion hardware and shipping excluded. Additionally they also pay via bank transfer at the end of every month and all you need to do to get started is to fill up the application form which you can find on their official website.

Another good thing about VR Sync’s affiliate program is they also offer cookies that last for 60 days similar to that of Autodesk’s affiliate program. This is not something you commonly expect to see in many affiliate programs as most only last for a maximum of 30 days.

Quick Fact: VR Sync’s services have been supported by companies like Ford and Nikon as well as the organisation of the United Nations. Their affordable rates and free trials coupled with the already broad influence they have make it easy for affiliates to land conversions. Additionally they also offer guides for interested applicants to watch and learn from before getting started.

6. Ledger Wallet affiliate program

Another option for an affiliate program within the metaverse is Ledger’s own affiliate program. Ledger is one of the leading platforms used by cryptocurrency users to buy secure exchange and grow their digital assets without having to worry so much about security risks.

Becoming a Ledger affiliate is very easy as you only need to complete the application form and confirm your identity to be qualified as a marketer. After that you will be given access to a dashboard where you’ll find your affiliate link to share on your chosen platform (or platforms).

The affiliate program pays in Bitcoin though which can either be a dealbreaker or a deal maker to some applicants depending on their mastery of the digital asset. Benefits included in this program are the real-time reports that they provide under your account a dedicated support channel for affiliate marketers and promotional assets that can help affiliates secure a conversion effectively.

With over 20000 current members and a guaranteed influence on 4 million users in the crypto space Ledger’s affiliate program proves to be an ideal option for those who wish to venture into the industry of affiliate marketing.

Quick Fact: The Ledger’s affiliate program is open to anyone who has a voice and advocates for the security and self-custody of digital assets. Bloggers YouTubers Instagram influencers and even Crypto companies can enjoy the benefits of being an affiliate of Ledger’s program.

The metaverse has certainly upped its potential in hosting a wide variety of processes and for marketers and business owners it has also taken the form of an effective affiliate marketing platform. Despite being relatively new in this initiative it does not necessarily mean that the metaverse has limited options in hosting equally effective affiliate marketing programs.

While some companies will find more revenue by launching targeted promotional campaigns like offering discounts for seniors the six previously discussed examples of affiliate programs are relevant for a much wider base of businesses. These metaverse affiliate programs are proof of the potential of this new frontier for modern marketing strategies that would otherwise be limited to Web 2.0.

It is still worth keeping in mind though that no matter how famous the product you will be marketing is or no matter how competitive the commission rates and other benefits may be the conversion will still depend on how well you advertise the product and effectively use the affiliate links provided to turn a reader into a subscriber.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2h5ZGVyYWJhZC9tYWtlLWl0LW1vdmUtY2hhbGxlbmdlLWlpaXQtaHlkZXJhYmFkLXN0dWRlbnRzLXdhbGwtcHJvamVjdC1sZXRzLXlvdS1pbnRlcmFjdC13aXRoLWFydC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjI5MTMwMy5jbXPSAaYBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9oeWRlcmFiYWQvbWFrZS1pdC1tb3ZlLWNoYWxsZW5nZS1paWl0LWh5ZGVyYWJhZC1zdHVkZW50cy13YWxsLXByb2plY3QtbGV0cy15b3UtaW50ZXJhY3Qtd2l0aC1hcnQvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2MjkxMzAzLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Make it move challenge: IIIT-Hyderabad student's wall project lets you interact with art,"HYDERABAD: Students of the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad ( IIIT-H) have created an interactive wall art project which lets the audience engage with the artwork.This creation by students of MTech in product design and management won them second place in the 'Make It Move' challenge conducted by Autodesk Instructables  an online community of makers and innovators.This challenge invited projects with movement.For this they initially built an electro-mechanical tile consisting of 16 servo motors to move LEDs forward and backward. The tile could either be used individually or assembled with multiple other tiles to create a large 'wall'.""When a user's palm approaches the tile(s) the tiles move creating interesting visual effects and patterns. This has been made possible with the help of a camera and computer vision that tracks palm movement"" said Josh Ellas Joy  who was part of the team adding : ""The idea was also to make it a fun experience.""While the initial prototypes were made with 3D printers from the makers lab at the institute for the final version the team used a laser cutting machine and built it with a medium-density fibreboard (MDF) and acrylic. The acrylic sheets were assembled with individual cylinders fitted with a rack and pinion mechanism driven by servo motors to provide movement.""I have worked on similar electronics projects before but never controlled 16 motors that powered close to 990 LEDs. You can actually control the colour of each LED"" addedJosh and revealed that the project was designed by students as part of their two-month-long product design workshop which forms an integral part of the MTech coursework and submitted the same for the contest as they felt it was a perfect fit.The team said that they were constrained by time and hence restricted themselves to a small wall but added that they can scale it to something bigger like tracking the entire body or creating a more complex interactive exchange.",,,,,,
ADP,Automatic Data Processing,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzc2VtYmx5bWFnLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy85NzUxNy1zb2Z0d2FyZS1rZWVwcy1zdGlobHMtYXNzZW1ibHktbWFjaGluZXMtdXAtYW5kLXJ1bm5pbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Software Keeps STIHL's Assembly Machines Up and Running,"STIHL is a German manufacturer of chainsaws trimmers blowers and other handheld power equipment. Founded in 1926 the family-owned company is only chain saw manufacturer to make its own saw chains and guide bars. The company’s factory in Virginia Beach VA is ASSEMBLY magazine’s 2014 Assembly Plant of the Year.

At STIHL manufacturing facilities maintenance is organized into two divisions. Each division has its own maintenance team that uses their technical expertise to monitor and maintain the plant’s daily operations. Situated above them is a central maintenance pool which is made up of specialists whose job it is to support the on-site teams when there are time constraints or when specialized know-how is required.

Due to their geographical proximity the maintenance teams working at STIHL’s assembly plants in Waiblingen and Ludwigsburg Germany can easily exchange ideas and share experiences. That isn’t quite the case with the STIHL maintenance teams located in Switzerland the USA Brazil and China. However the lack of frequency is made up for by the quality of the exchanges; when they do take place they are run in the form of workshops conducted by in-house staff who make production equipment for the company.

STIHL believes that designing and making its own production equipment gives the company an important competitive advantage. The goal is to ensure the greatest possible utilization of plant capacity. According to Thomas Ruppmann who has been involved in the design of production facilities at STIHL since 1991 it is invaluable for operations that “the plant constructors are in-house and readily available. When we build our own plants then we are responsible for them for their entire service life. This means that from the planning stage to the manufacturing stage it is in our interest to ensure that the quality of the machinery is as high as possible so that it will pose few problems in the future.”

One tool that helps STIHL engineers keep equipment up and running is Versiondog software from AUVESY GmbH. The software provides uniform central data storage automatic data backup version management with detailed change detection and clear documentation.

Ruppmann has been a versiondog user since the very beginning. “We always carry out user management in twos then we create a backup job and check to see that the system continues to run as it should” he says.

Ruppmann’s team is supported by central IT who are responsible for ensuring the availability of the network infrastructure and server. Ruppmann previously worked with an older version-control system called VersionWorks and later helped the company to transition to Versiondog. “It is a convenient easy-to-use tool that helps us greatly in our daily work” he says.

At the beginning of the backup era data management was not yet a problem at least not when it came to the task of looking for the latest software version Ruppmann explains. This was because large programming devices were wheeled into the production areas. As such “it was always clear where the data was” Ruppmann recalls.

However as the task of backing up data began to involve the use of portable data storage devices especially USB sticks it began to get more difficult. There was a risk of misplacing data storage devices. As such the reason for introducing Versiondog did not so much stem from a need to reduce time spent looking for the latest software version. Rather it was part of an ongoing endeavor to optimize processes.

Bit by bit Versiondog was implemented across all machines and in all areas of production. Today at the STIHL headquarters in Waiblingen some 220 users work with Versiondog. Even though production facilities constitute the focal point of Versiondog’s work the software is not only involved in production. Building services engineers work with the software too. They use it for managing circuit diagrams and ventilation and light controller programs. It also helps those involved in quality assurance testing.

Since the requirements of these functional areas vary access rights are allocated differently. The information needed by the facility management is different from that required by maintenance. Versiondog enables managers to control access rights. For assembly line construction access rights are restricted particularly where specialized knowledge is involved.

“We are already using the system when we make production equipment to archive intermediate stages of construction” says Ruppmann.

Occasionally during the commissioning stage of a plant a section may need to be reprogrammed. On those occasions it is beneficial to go back to a previous version.

“I can certainly say that we have found a tool with which we are able to access all necessary information about the plant on the spot” says Ruppmann. “This ease of access frequently helps to reduce downtime at the plant.”

With the help of an extensive WLAN system it is possible to use Versiondog to access program versions of individual PLCs as well as electrical and pneumatic circuit diagrams which the maintenance team also refer to as “Quicktipps.”

It is possible to access instructions and documents of both common and not-so-common devices from all production areas.

The first task for Versiondog was the task of backing up PLC software. The more the team’s confidence in using the application grew the more possibilities the software revealed. One feature of the software that is appreciated is the fact that it can integrate important editors so engineers can work in a familiar environment.

“All we have to do is define the directories and project tree structure. There is no need to additionally program the system to do this” Ruppmann explains.

Today all STIHL production facilities in Germany have implemented Versiondog as part of their data management strategy. This encompasses some 3000 machines and 7600 components. Each production facility has set up three components as standard: controller programs circuit diagrams and documentation. If needed engineers can add additional subdirectories—for instance for robots or tightening system controllers.

Documentation includes a variety of files including PDFs and Excel spreadsheets—everything to do with control technology that can be saved in a file format. Since the introduction of Versiondog some 46000 file versions have been created and checked in. Despite that high total the software does not require a lot of memory. The amount of storage required on the server amounts to less than 1.5 gigabytes.

At STIHL only the latest version of a file is checked out by default to save time. “What’s more” says Ruppman “the process of carrying out a comparison of an S7 unit for example is very quick.”

Versiondog’s “Factory Floor Status” feature is a useful WebClient add-on that enables engineers to see the status of all devices and equipment that are integrated in the system according to a number of device-specific monitors such as installed firmware MLFB numbers force values RAM use and cycle time.

Devices are backed up at STIHL on a daily basis to ensure that the latest production data is always available. Backups enable the detection of unintended changes. As backups are run in the background they do not have to be constantly monitored. When anomalies are detected members of the appropriate team will receive immediate notification via email.

Ruppmann says he rarely needs to call the AUVESY support hotline. “The system is stable and very intuitive to use” he says.

It only takes a short amount of time to train new team members to use the system and acceptance of the software is high.

The new location at 109 Richmond Square replaces Maize Mexican Cantina which closed in mid-November. Tequila Mexican Grill is owned by siblings Sisly and Gerardo Ramirez who opened their first restaurant in August 2020 at 805A Rohrerstown Road a spot just north of Marietta Pike.

Tequila Mexican Grill & Bar features fajitas burritos chimichangas and other Mexican dishes as well as traditional Mexican pastries. The new restaurant in Richmond Square offers a slightly expanded menu from what’s available in East Hempfield Township.

The Ramirezes operate their new restaurant under a management agreement with Mick Owens who owned Maize Mexican Cantina along with four Mick’s All-American Pub locations. Owens said he closed Maize Mexican Cantina so he could concentrate on his other restaurants.

Maize Mexican Cantina opened in October 2018 in a 5000-square-foot corner restaurant space in Richmond Square a retail and residential development at Fruitville Pike and Route 272. It featured a menu that included burritos fajitas and tacos. The space had previously been home to Firepit Kitchen + Bar.

The Albertine Graben Refinery Consortium (AGRC) closed the agreement on capital investments or FID this week on the sidelines of the US-Africa Leaders Summit in the US capital Washington according to a statement from State House.

“The announcement today brings Uganda and the region one step closer to a long-held dream: to add value to our resources and achieve energy security and economic prosperity for all its citizens” Mr Museveni was quoted as saying.

AGRC’s executives were led by Ms Rajakumari Jandhyala the chief executive of Washington DC-based Yaatra Ventures LLC and the presidents of Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) Eastern and Southern Trade and Development Bank (TDB) Honeywell Baker Hughes.

AGRC is a special purpose vehicle formed by America’s General Electric International Operations Company Inc Italy’s Saipem SpA Mauritius-based private equity fund Intra-continental Asset Holdings (IA) and Washington DC based Yaatra Ventures LLC.

The consortium had been beaten to the tender by a Chinese joint venture but the deal was flipped on the premise of balancing foreign interests in Uganda’s oil sector.

The upstream (operation of the oil fields) are French TotalEnergies EP and China’s CNOOC which also carry stake in midstream (East African Crude Oil Pipeline).

The refinery once developed will be the first American-Italian investment in Uganda.

AGRC was handed the refinery tender on the basis of among others the reputable companies in its stable (General Electric with an estimated turnover of $300 billion and Saipem SpA) which meant “good corporate governance and strong project risk management principles” capable of attracting private equity financing.

The refinery is expected to be financed in a Public Private Partnership arrangement of 60:40 ratio.

The government’s 40 percent equity share is equivalent to Shs2 trillion ($500 million) and was defined in December 2017 by the Uganda National Oil Company (Unoc) shareholders; the ministries of Finance and Energy at their last annual general meeting.

Uganda’s share will be carried through the Uganda Refinery Holding Company a subsidiary of Unoc which is mandated to manage the country’s commercial interests in the oil sector.

Kenya and Tanzania had initially offered to buy 2.5 percent and eight percent stakes respectively as part of Uganda’s 40 percent share. TotalEnergies E&P also offered to buy a 10 percent stake leaving the government with roughly 19 percent stake. It remains unclear how far discussions progressed.





Standing his ground

After announcing discovery of commercial oil volumes in 2006 President Museveni stood his ground on developing a local refinery even when the project economics remain unconvincing for some industry players.

The President has variously argued that there is a ready market in Uganda for the locally refined petroleum products and a captive market in Rwanda East Congo and other neighbouring countries—making Uganda’s refinery viable.

According to the Energy ministry Uganda’s fuel/petroleum products imports as of last September averaged 85 million litres with demand growing at seven percent per annum.

The planned refinery will produce Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) diesel petrol kerosene jet fuel and Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO).

Uganda’s petroleum products imports as of mid- last September averaged at 85 million with demand growing at seven percent per annum according to the Energy ministry.

During the Washington meeting AFC’s chief executive officer Samaila Zubairu said they are one of the early-stage investors and committed to investing and supporting the mobilisation of capital from partners for the economically transformative refinery project.

“This project supports sustainable industrialisation provides employment to one of the youngest populations on the planet and helps achieve a more equitable energy transition in Africa” Mr Zubairu was quoted as saying.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2FmcmljYW9pbGdhc3JlcG9ydC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi9mYXJtLWluLWZhcm0tb3V0L3Npcml1cy13aXRoLWZ1bmRzLWluLWhhbmQtdGFrZXMtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1vZi1hYnVyYS1maWVsZC1yZWRldmVsb3BtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sirius with Funds in Hand Takes Over Management of Abura Field Redevelopment - Africa's premier report on the oil ...,"Sirius with Funds in Hand Takes Over Management of Abura Field Redevelopment

Sirius has now fulfilled all conditions needed to access the funding facility for the planned redevelopment of the Abura field in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 65 and will assume key senior management positions within CMES–OMS Petroleum Development Company (COPDC) Limited the organization which “owns” the project.

Sirius holds 30% in COPDC who in turn has a Finance and Technical Sales Agreement (FTSA) with NNPC Ltd the licenceholder of OML 65. But Sirius is the one bringing the finances as well as technical and managerial expertise to the project.

With these credentials Sirius takes fuller control of OML 65 redevelopment with its executives assuming the positions of Managing Director Finance Director Executive Director and Vice-Chairman of COPDC “and will immediately begin to accumulate cash flow entitlements related to the assumption of operational responsibility for existing production at the Abura field”.

Following the approvals previously secured from NNPC regarding the commencement of Phase 1 of the OML65 Approved Work Programme (AWP) Sirius can now start drawing down funds under the senior loan facility of up to $200Million executed with (the commodity trader) Trafigura to finance the well drilling re-entry and completion in OML 65 notably the Abura field to boost production by as high as 11000Barrels of Oil Per Day to reach around 16000BOPD.

The project has come a long way even though it is yet to take off.

The context: In 2019 COPDC the Nigerian E&P company founded by Hosa Okunbor who was very well connected to President Muhammadu Buhari secured an FTSA with the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) an NNPC subsidiary which holds the right to OML 65 located onshore mid-western Nigeria in the Niger Delta basin. COPDC had never operated an E&P asset before it was granted the FTSA a deal it clinched largely as a result of political connections of its principal.

Sirius Petroleum as of then was desperate to get in on the action on any bankable hydrocarbon project. The OML 65 revamp as it were has provided it the first real opportunity for relevance.

Phase 1 of the AWP will be undertaken in conjunction with Baker Hughes under a Master Services Agreement (“MSA”) which has been executed with Sirius and will involve the drilling of up to nine wells on the Abura field intended to produce the remaining 2P reserves of 16.2 MMbbl1.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNpYWxleHByZXNzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9pbnZlc3RpbmctYWJyb2FkLW5hc2RhcS0xMDAtYWRkcy1zaXgtY29tcGFuaWVzLXRvLXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1pbmRleC10cmFkaW5nLXRvLWJlZ2luLWZyb20tdGhpcy1kYXRlLTI5MTczMjgv0gGcAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmFuY2lhbGV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ludmVzdGluZy1hYnJvYWQtbmFzZGFxLTEwMC1hZGRzLXNpeC1jb21wYW5pZXMtdG8tc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWluZGV4LXRyYWRpbmctdG8tYmVnaW4tZnJvbS10aGlzLWRhdGUtMjkxNzMyOC9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nasdaq 100 adds six companies to stock market index trading to begin from this date,"The list of companies in the Nasdaq 100 the technology-heavy index will witness a change.

It’s one thing to build a strong and people-first culture but it’s a whole other ball game to sustain one. Hopefully you find this useful as we look ahead to 2023.

The entire Virgin brand has been built from Dad’s understanding that if you look after your people your people will look after your business. We’ve never under-estimated the collective power of like-minded people who are all committed to changing business for good and looking out for each other every step of the way. So the first way to build and maintain a healthy culture is to look after your people and make sure you’re hiring the right fit. At Virgin we look for optimists. We look for people who praise instead of criticise and who are passionate about making the world a better place. This is particularly important at a senior leadership level as an incompatible leader can quickly corrode the company culture and much more too. When we hire leaders and managers we make sure they understand that the company’s first obligation is to our people and our purpose.

Virgin Atlantic

Secondly you’ve got to walk the walk and talk the talk when it comes to creating a workplace that is 100% human focussed. At Virgin we pride ourselves on letting people bring their authentic self to work each and every day – and celebrating our differences. We also try to be as flexible as possible as we know people have lives outside of work. This shows up in many different ways across the Group. At Virgin Management our people benefits range from unlimited (and paid) annual leave to shared parental leave; private healthcare; dental insurance; adoption and surrogacy leave; fully flexible working; free lunches; and full-scale fertility support.

Beyond implementing forward-thinking people policies and benefits it’s crucial for businesses to build workplace cultures that break down the hidden barriers forcing far too many people to suffer in silence. When I returned to work from maternity leave I experienced a period of intense anxiety - but when I opened up to my colleagues and loved ones I realised I certainly wasn’t alone and I felt an incredible amount of support and compassion. This is why we need to facilitate and normalise these conversations at work and provide a safe place for people to reach out about the challenges they are facing outside of work. Creating a culture based off trust belonging and transparency is key.

Holly Branson

It's also critical to understand that culture is built off healthy relationships. As James Rutter (chief creative officer at COOK and a passionate B Corp advocate) put it at a recent 100% Human At Work gathering I joined said:

The unit of any culture is the relationship we have with one another.

Sometimes businesses get too caught up in the research papers and the workplace seminars and they forget that culture comes from people connecting with one another and forming healthy relationships. Nurturing these relationships in the same way as you nurture the relationships you have with friends and family is a simple way to help one another thrive. We’re all human at the end of the day and we’re always happiest when we’re in healthy relationships.

Virgin Stars 2019 | Image from Owen Billcliffe

Finally it’s important to know that when culture comes under threat you’re best to go back to the basics. Your purpose and your values should underpin everything you do so if they are healthy well communicated and prioritised everything will flow from there. When they become challenged or dismissed and culture becomes contaminated you can’t put your head in the sand. You’ve got to roll up your sleeves address the core issues go back to your values and make sure your leaders are modelling the values and the behaviours you want.",,,,,,,,,

The Federal Reserve's latest interest rate increase did little to change Bank of America's recession outlook.

Analysts wrote in a Thursday note viewed by Insider that the central bank's 50-basis-point hike ""provides little relief"" to their 2023 economic outlook.

""Following the Fed's recent 50bps rate hike our BofA economists remain cautious on the US economy and continue to expect a mild recession starting in 1Q23 with negative US GDP for 2023"" the note said.

While BofA posits stocks have a material downside of 36% next year analysts highlighted three market areas still worth considering.

""Our BofA strategists prefer quality income and small caps to growth stocks going into 2023"" the note said. Analysts also added that this outlook remains ""cautious for our Internet coverage group"" which includes companies like Amazon Alphabet Meta EBay and Expedia.

BofA specifically highlighted Meta and Google-parent Alphabet as best poised to navigate a potential recession successfully. And despite deep cuts to advertising revenue remaining a threat to both companies in a recession BofA says they still ""have potential investment spending and bonus accrual flexibility that could enable the companies to grow earnings in a mild to moderate recession scenario with flat to down revenues.""

Both companies did not perform well during the 2008 Great Financial Crisis but present economic headwinds are driven by inflation as opposed to a fundamental break in markets that investors saw in the last major recession.

And despite Meta laying off a record number of employees in 2022 the company's commitment to the metaverse and artificial intelligence investments remain positive points for the company's future the note added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbGF3Lm5kLmVkdS9uZXdzLWV2ZW50cy9uZXdzL2luLW1lbW9yaWFtLXBhdWwtai1wb2xraW5nLTU5LTY2LWotZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In Memoriam: Paul J. Polking '59 '66 J.D. | The Law School | University of Notre Dame,"It is with deep sadness that Notre Dame Law School announces the passing of dear friend alumnus and longtime Law Advisory Council member Paul J. Polking. He passed away December 14 2022 at the age of 85.

Paul was a devoted “Double Domer” having graduated with a B.S. from the University of Notre Dame in 1959 and his J.D. from Notre Dame Law School in 1966. He was a current and active member of the Law Advisory Council since 1994 including years of service as president of the Advisory Council.

He and his wife Joan Y. Polking were two of the most generous donors to Notre Dame Law School. The stained-glass window behind the tabernacle in the Law School’s St. Thomas More Chapel bears their names. The Polking Family Fellowships are a lasting testament of their commitment to Notre Dame Law School students.

Paul had a successful legal career culminating in his service as the executive vice president and general counsel of Bank of America. He was a member of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States and a member of the Knights of Malta. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws from Belmont Abbey College and the President’s Award from the North Carolina Black Lawyers Association.

“For me personally Paul Polking was a delight” said Joseph A. Matson Dean and Professor of Law G. Marcus Cole. “Despite illness distance and the pandemic Paul participated in Advisory Council meetings and gatherings always with cheerful support of our efforts to make Notre Dame Law School the best it can be for our nation our Church and our world.”

Arrangements include visitation from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. on Monday December 19 in the Activity Center at St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church 6828 Old Reid Road Charlotte North Carolina. A rosary will be held at 7:30 p.m.

A Funeral Mass will be held at 10 a.m. on Tuesday December 20 at St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church.

Interment will follow at 10 a.m. on Wednesday December 21 at Belmont Abbey Cemetery in Belmont North Carolina.

“I ask the entire Law School community to join me in praying for the Polking family including Joan their children and their grandchildren” Dean Cole said. “We will miss him.”

But is this your best option in a crowded 0% APR credit card market? Team Clark set out to measure the usefulness of U.S. Bank’s Platinum offering in this credit card review.

Table of Contents

Team Clark has spent time evaluating the credit card market in several categories including the best options for balance transfers and 0% APR introductory periods. We’ve compared the U.S. Bank Visa Platinum Card to the best cards in these segments of the market. And we’ve determined that it’s a viable choice for those seeking a 0% APR period on both new purchases and balance transfers because of its long introductory period.

As you’re making your decision on whether the U.S. Bank Visa Platinum Card is a fit for you please use Team Clark’s review of the card in conjunction with Clark Howard’s 7 Rules for Using Credit Cards.

What Is the U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card?

The U.S. Bank Visa Platinum Card is a credit card known for its generous 18-month introductory 0% APR periods for both new purchases and balance transfers (afterward the variable APR will be 18.99% – 28.99% based on creditworthiness).

The card carries no annual fee but it does not have a rewards program to incentivize purchases.

U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card: Specs and Perks

Before we get too far into whether or not this credit card is the right choice for you let’s take a look at the fine print to examine some of the card’s perks and drawbacks:

Cardholder Benefits and Perks

Welcome Period for New Purchases: There is a 18-month introductory period for 0% APR on new purchases. This means you could potentially spend — without interest — for nearly two years if you maintain your minimum payments and pay off the balance before the conclusion of the welcome period. Afterward the variable APR will be 18.99% – 28.99% based on creditworthiness.

Optimal Uses for the U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card

The U.S. Bank Visa Platinum Card is versatile enough to be a potential add for consumers who are in different stages of their financial lives.

Let’s take a look at some of the strategies for getting the most from this card:

Advertisement

As a 0% Purchasing Card

If you’re not carrying any credit card debt and are looking to make a significant purchase soon this U.S. Bank card could be an attractive option.

With such a long 0% APR period a new cardholder could have the better part of two years to pay off the balance on this card before the first dollar of interest will come due.

For example you could make a large purchase — such as a $3000 riding lawn mower — and pay it off with 20 $150 payments for the duration of the introductory 0% APR period.

As a Balance Transfer Card

If you already have a credit card balance you probably have your eyes on the generous balance transfer offer that comes with this card. U.S. Bank matches the 18-month period for 0% APR on new purchases with the same term for 0% APR on a balance transfer. Afterward the variable APR will be 18.99% – 28.99% based on creditworthiness.

But before you apply and start moving your money around there are a couple of things to consider.

First you must move balances to the U.S. Bank card within the first 60 days of card membership to get the promotional rate. So you’ll need to move quickly once you get the card.

Next you’re going to need to do a little math to make sure a balance transfer is a right move for your balance.

U.S. Bank charges 3% (or a minimum of $5) on all balance transfer transactions whichever is greater. So if you’re looking to move $3000 in credit card debt you’re going to owe $100 in transfer fees. Depending on the interest charges you’re paying with your current credit card it’s likely that you’d still save money over the next 18 months. But if you have a shorter payoff plan that may not be a given.

You can use this handy tool from Capital One to measure a payoff amount for your current credit card balance to see if a balance transfer is the best decision for you.

Clark Does Not Recommend Using It For Both Balance Transfers and New Purchases

Since U.S. Bank is simultaneously offering welcome periods for new purchases and balance transfers it could be tempting to take advantage of both offers.

Advertisement

Clark advises against that type of strategy because a person taking advantage of the 0% APR period for new purchases typically has a different financial situation from someone who needs to make a sizeable credit card balance transfer.

If you have an existing credit card balance in need of transfer Clark wants you to focus on eliminating that debt as soon as possible.

“I don’t want people to have a mixed message that while they’re paying off a balance they are getting rewards on additional purchases. I want the focus to be 100% on being credit-card debt free and not being lured in by a reward you may get for continuing your credit-buying habit” Clark says.

U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card vs. Bank of America Cash Rewards: Which Is Better?

Both the U.S. Bank Visa Platinum and the Bank of America® Cash Rewards Credit Card made Team Clark’s list of the best 0% APR cards on the market. And they’re both offerings from major bank brands where many readers already do their day-to-day banking. So we decided to take a closer look at the two to see which may be the best fit in the category.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the key characteristics of the cards:

Card Feature U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card Bank of America® Cash Rewards Credit Card Introductory 0% APR Period on New Purchases 18 months 15 months Introductory 0% APR Period on Balance Transfers 18 months 15 months Annual Fee $0 $0 Cash Back Rewards None 3% on category of choice; 2% at grocery stores; 1% everywhere else Welcome Bonus None $200 with $1000 spending in first 90 days Free Credit Monitoring Yes TransUnion Yes FICO Cell Phone Protection Yes No

As you can see the main difference in these cards is the length of the introductory period and the stark contrast in rewards. If you’re in the market for a longer 0% APR period for paying down some debt the U.S. Bank card may be the choice. If you’re interested in using the card frequently after the introductory period the Bank of America card is much more inviting with its cash back rewards structure.

Final Thoughts

Are you considering adding the U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card to your wallet? Let’s review some of the major pros and cons of the card before you make your final decision:

Pros Cons Generous intro APR period on purchases and transfers No rewards program $0 annual fee No welcome bonus Cell phone protection plan Very vanilla cardmember perks

Bottom Line: U.S. Bank is using a long introductory period on balance transfers and new purchases to lure new cardmembers. If you need an extended period of time to pay off a balance this card could provide the cushion that you need to get your finances in order. However if you’re planning on using the card for an everyday spender you’re going to be disappointed in the lack of a rewards program. Many other cards on the market could give you a better return on your spending."

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

Open this photo in gallery: Holburne Museum Bath's first public art gallery and former home of Sir Thomas Holburne.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vc3BvcnQvcnVnYnktdW5pb24vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY3cwdmxlMW41cnJv0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9ydWdieS11bmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy9jdzB2bGUxbjVycm8uYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Premiership: Newcastle Falcons 17-28 Bath,"It was a fast start by Bath who went over for the first time inside five minutes. Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

In truth Bath's discipline gave Newcastle hope of a comeback as the latter stages were littered with penalties but they managed to hold on for the win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDI0LTA1LTA5L2Zvcm1lci1iZWQtYmF0aC1zdWVzLWh1ZHNvbi1iYXktZm9yLTMwMC1taWxsaW9uLXRyYWRpbmctZ2FpbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Bed Bath & Beyond Sues Hudson Bay for $300 Million in Trading Profits,"Why did this happen?

The company operationally based in Fridley has been hit with 11 Class I recalls in 2022 and 12 in 2021 — far more than usual. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration reserves its Class I status for the most serious life-threatening medical device problems.

For comparison between 2017 and 2020 Medtronic averaged about five Class I recalls a year.

Seven of the company's 23 recalls in the last two years are related to the HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device (HVAD) that Medtronic acquired in 2016. Four of those recalls were in 2021; three were this year.

""Acquired products (such as HVAD) have been the biggest contributor to Class I … growth"" said Erika Winkels a spokeswoman for Medtronic. ""Improvements have been made to our process for assessing and integrating acquired products to reduce the contribution of acquired products to product quality issues moving forward.""

As of June 2021 when Medtronic stopped selling the beleaguered product the company said 14 deaths had been linked to defects with the HVAD device. So far Medtronic's 2022 recalls are linked to a small number of deaths.

The uptick in recalls at the world's largest medical device maker is troubling to many.

""Clearly there's a problem when a company has this many recalls — Class I recalls on important potentially life-saving devices"" said Diana Zuckerman president of Washington D.C.-based National Center for Health Research a nonprofit think tank that works to improve the safety and effectiveness of medical products.

Medtronic bet big on HVAD technology when it acquired Massachusetts-based HeartWare International Inc. for $1.1 billion in 2016. But it has cost Medtronic just as much to unspool the product's string of legal and regulatory problems. According to details in a financial filing earlier this year Medtronic has taken $1.1 billion in charges connected to exiting the HVAD business.

Acquiring technology from other companies Zuckerman said does not absolve Medtronic of its device safety responsibilities. She said one issue stems from the way the FDA regulates medical devices many of which — unlike pharmaceuticals — are not required to submit any clinical trial data prior to approval.

""That is a known weakness of the FDA but it does put the onus on the company"" she said. ""Regardless of what FDA requires them to do companies should be really careful making sure their product is safe.""

When the pandemic hit the FDA stopped most foreign and domestic inspections except for cases considered mission critical.

Class I medical device recalls are increasing across the industry said Rachna Shah of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota who studies medical device and pharmaceutical recalls.

""In general recalls are higher"" Shah said. She said one possible explanation for more serious recalls is that device companies may have become less rigorous in safety reviews for their products as the FDA was doing less monitoring.

She expects marginally higher recalls to continue through the end of next year.

But Medtronic's rate of recalls has significantly outpaced its competitors. Illinois-based Abbott has seen only one recall this year. Massachusetts-based Boston Scientific Corp. has had no recalls in 2022. Illinois-based Baxter International has had five recalls. All three of those companies have operations in Minnesota.

Medtronic with fiscal 2022 sales of $31.7 billion is the largest medical device manufacturer in the industry which puts it at higher recall risk because it simply makes more products than anyone else.

Abbott has diverse business lines; its medical device sales for 2021 were $14.4 billion. Boston Scientific posted revenue of $11.9 billion. Not counting its pharmaceutical division Baxter had $10.5 billion in medical device sales last year. Medtronic's revenue is equivalent to 86% of the combined sales of those three companies.

""The number of Class 1 recalls in recent years is atypical for us"" Medtronic's Winkels said.

Medtronic has established a central medical safety organization and added a patient safety and risk board. The board includes senior leaders from several departments — medical safety quality regulatory and legal — and provides oversight for patient safety decisions. Both were implemented in 2022.

""We have examined our end-to-end quality performance and we are focused on making sustainable improvements"" said Noel Colon Medtronic's chief quality officer. He said the company has increased oversight in such areas as risk assessment product design and integration of acquired therapies and solutions.

Medical device recalls often begin with the company which sends out alerts to doctors and patients when a problem is discovered. The FDA doesn't typically classify the severity of the recall — Class I II or III — until a few months later meaning that a recall listed on the FDA's index for 2022 may have first been launched by the company in 2021.

Unlike food and consumer product recalls a medical device recall does not necessarily mean that the product is removed from a patient and returned to the company. Recalls can often involve adjustments to device settings software updates or re-labeling a product.

In the case of any recall Medtronic undertakes a detailed investigation to resolve the issue and prevent its recurrence Winkels said.

This year's high number of recalls prompted Medtronic to implement new plans and programs that include a more rigorous review of a device's risk assessment.

Winkels said the company has ""leveraged external experts for independent perspective subject matter expertise and to supplement internal Medtronic resources.""

In September the FDA identified the company's recall of NIM endotracheal tubes as a Class I case. Medtronic reported 15 complaints two deaths and three injuries related to the device between March 31 2020 and March 31 2022.

The FDA issued a Class I recall of Cobalt Cobalt XT and Crome defibrillators in August due to the potential for delivering lower-than-necessary shocks to the patient. That issue was addressed with a software update. Medtronic reported 27 complaints and zero deaths or injuries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWVkaWFsaW5lLm9yZy9uZXdzL29waW5pb24vb25lLW9mLW1vdGhlci10ZXJlc2FzLW1pcmFjbGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One of Mother Teresa’s Miracles,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='themedialine.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/opinion/one-of-mother-teresas-miracles/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D8030B1C0>, 'Connection to themedialine.org timed out.

I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that Stephen Baxter’s work sprawls narratively spatially temporally conceptually and cosmologically. He also has a fondness for extravagantly displacing his protagonists and for setting his stories in strange and mysterious environments. And he does love a comprehensive apocalyptic disaster – see his recent World En­gines: Destroyer or Galaxias. What I find espe­cially interesting is how many ways he manages to reconfigure these motifs tropes and options in his latest The Thousand Earths.

The novel alternates two narrative threads whose precise relationship is hinted at but not made clear for most of the book’s length. The novel is named for the setting of one thread: some­where and somewhen there is a flat artificial human-inhabited world one of ‘‘the bright blue-green diamonds of the thousand Earths in their regular array’’ (perhaps along the lines of a Dyson swarm) and it is decaying – literally crumbling along its edges at a predictable rate of 60 meters a day. The girl Mela sees this for herself at age 12 when her parents take her to the Perimeter to witness the destruction as it proceeds:

The grassy sward she walked on came to a visible end not far beyond the crimson rope like the edge of a ragged cliff in some storybook depiction of the Heartland Moun­tains. Beyond that only a pearly featureless light…. She did see a fence running down to the edge and ending in a ragged dangling rip – and then further back what looked like a collapsed house – or rather half-collapsed. Somebody’s home falling into – what?

The experience shapes the next 30 years of her life as she (like everyone else) copes with the creeping and then galloping disaster. Mela’s world is filled with parallels to what we can see on the news any given morning: guarded borders refugee caravans and camps opportunistic exploi­tation and abuse and all the varieties of response to massive dislocations.

The other story line will eventually somehow converge with Mela’s. It begins with the departure of a 22nd-century exploratory round trip to the Andromeda galaxy which is predicted to col­lide with the Milky Way in a few billion years. This supremely unlikely expedition depends on some miraculous enabling starship technology and eventually on the stubborn dedication of its sole surviving member John Hackett. But we barely hear about Andromeda. Instead the story picks up on Hackett’s return to Earth five million years later to find what has become of humankind which has managed to survive in a recognizable state even though the homeworld is much changed. And the Andromeda mission is just the start of Hackett’s travels which take him on a series of vastly longer voyages making him into a temporal tourist who witnesses the fate of our species and its solar system and eventually of much more.

The two story lines operate in quite different modes and have different emotional effects. Mela’s story is part bildungsroman and part slow-motion disaster tale and her life is dominated by her ef­forts to mitigate the effects of a collapsing social and physical environment on those fleeing the relentless advance of the Perimeter that is shrink­ing the world. These ‘‘Immies’’ – Immigrants – are refugees lacking the paperwork (or means or political influence) to ensure a safe harbor in some untouched city or territory fenced out and left to fend for themselves often scorned by the (so far) safe citizenry and abused by city border guards.

Hackett’s thread on the other hand is a kind of Wellsian-Clarkean tale of temporal-cultural displacement with a big dash of utopian possibili­ties – a far future of miraculous technologies of Eloi without Morlocks – against a background of Stapledonian cosmic change. And Hackett’s time-dilated voyages increase by orders of magnitude taking him deep into the future and the senescence of the universe.

As fantastical as the ideas on both sides of this novel are Baxter plays the hard-SF game with net up at least insofar as every major element is rooted in serious science – or at least serious scientific speculation – and he shows his work in an Afterword that lists more than a half-dozen sources/inspirations. Nor is it all science. The social disruptions of Mela’s story are modeled in part on dislocations familiar from the last two centuries of Earthly history from the Trail of Tears to World War II to the partition of India.

These wildly different story lines do converge though their thematic resolution may not click together as neatly as one might want. I suspect that the proper position from which to see this novel may be the context of Baxter’s earlier work which often returns to questions of our place among the infinities (to appropriate Robert Frost’s phrase). In fact much of his fiction operates as an intellectual/emotional supercollider in which mind-bending cosmic questions are smashed into social and personal worlds at high energy levels. The resulting shower of effects – special and emotional and artistic – are what science fiction is designed to produce.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaWNpdHluZXdzLmNvbS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2NvcXVpdGxhbS1hdGhsZXRlLWpvaW5zLWNhbmFkYXMtcXVlc3QtdG8tcmVwZWF0LXUxOC13b21lbnMtaG9ja2V5LWdvbGQtNjI2MjgyMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coquitlam's Jordan Baxter earns second stint with Canada's U18 worlds squad,"Jordan Baxter notched two points in her first international tournament and helped the red and white end its gold-medal drought.

Jordan Baxter is heading to Sweden in the new year in hopes of bringing a second straight world title back to Canada.

The Coquitlam athlete has earned another stint with the national squad for the 2023 under-18 women's world hockey championships building on what's already been a successful senior year in the minors thus far.

The 17-year-old forward collected two points in six games this past June in helping Canada lift its first trophy in three years for the IIHF division.

The 2022 tournament was originally rescheduled to be played in Sweden but was postponed and ultimately moved to Wisconsin due to the then state of the COVID-19 pandemic and backlash against the organizing committee.

As a result Baxter's first-ever appearance in a maple leaf sweater was delayed by two years.

Canada finished with a record of 4-2 that ended in a 3-2 victory over the United States to erase the under-18 squad's gold-medal drought.

The Tri-Cities Predators alumna made a difference in the offensive zone recording 26 shots on net and posting a 43.83 average win-percentage in the face-off circle.

Her first goal in red and white was against Slovakia in a a 7-0 quarter-final rout.

Baxter is currently serving as captain of Delta Hockey Academy and is their leading scorer as of this publication (Dec. 17) with 18 goals and 30 points in 16 games.

That's also good for second among female under-18 prep players in the Canadian Sport School Hockey League (CSSHL).

She's committed to playing for Ohio State University in NCAA Div. I women's hockey starting in the 2023-24 campaign and will be one of three B.C. players jetting off to Europe next month.

Canada's quest for another championships starts on Jan. 8 2023 in Östersund Sweden.

When Warren Buffett one of the greatest investors of all time makes a move the market listens. His company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) maintains an equities portfolio worth roughly $337 billion and investors through regulatory filings can see what stocks Berkshire is buying and selling every three months.

While Berkshire's buys often get a lot of attention investors should also keep an eye on his sales.

Berkshire selling a stock is not always indicative of that stock's performance or whether you should sell it's still something to be aware of. If you're holding a stock Berkshire is selling maybe you're missing something in your investment thesis. Here are six stocks Berkshire completely exited this year.

1. Verizon

Berkshire entered the year holding roughly 158.8 million shares of the large telecommunications company Verizon (VZ 1.53%) which were valued at close to $8.3 billion. But in the second quarter Berkshire completely closed out that position possibly because the company was repositioning for a much different economic and monetary outlook.

Berkshire may have been right to be concerned. When it released its second-quarter results Verizon also lowered its adjusted earnings guidance for the full fiscal year to a range of $5.10 to $5.25 down from $5.40 to $5.55. The company also lowered its guidance for revenue growth.

2. STORE Capital Corp

Heading into 2022 Berkshire held a little under $840 million in STORE Capital Corp (STOR) the sole real estate investment trust (REIT) in Berkshire's portfolio. As a REIT that gets special tax treatment STORE paid out at least 90% of its annual taxable income in dividends.

The company ran a triple-net lease single-tenant model in which it bought properties and then leased those properties back to the owners so the company didn't have to deal with the expenses of maintaining the property. In September the fund GIC and funds managed by Oak Street announced they would acquire STORE Capital for roughly $14 billion in cash so the stock has now really gone as far as it's going to go.

3. Abbvie

Berkshire came into the year holding about $410.7 million of the biopharmaceutical company Abbvie (ABBV 0.22%) but quickly exited the company in the first quarter of the year. It hasn't at all been a bad year for Abbvie with the stock up more than 21% and widely beating the broader market.

Abbvie reported mixed results for the third quarter with adjusted earnings beating estimates but revenue coming in less than expected. The company also confirmed the midpoint of its full-year earnings guidance range but lowered the upper bound.

4. Royalty Pharma

Berkshire sold its stake in the company Royalty Pharma (RPRX 0.43%) which totaled about $344 million at the start of 2022. Royalty Pharma funds biopharma research and development in a number of different ways and then acquires royalty interests in those companies so it's a bit like an incubator.

It's hard to see exactly what Berkshire didn't like as the stock is up more than 5% in a down year. The company's third-quarter earnings and revenue beat analyst estimates and the company raised full-year guidance. Perhaps Berkshire just didn't think the company had good long-term prospects.

5. Bristol-Myers Squibb

It was a bad year to be a pharmaceutical company in Berkshire's portfolio as the company clearly didn't like its exposure to the sector. Berkshire entered 2022 with about $324 million of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 0.45%) stock but exited its position in the first quarter of the year. This is another stock that has done quite well up more than 24% this year so it seems pretty clear that something earlier this year left Buffett and Berkshire with a bad taste in their mouths when it came to the pharmaceutical space.

6. Wells Fargo

Heading into this year it was well known that Buffett and Berkshire had had enough of the large bank Wells Fargo (WFC 1.00%). Wells Fargo found itself in the hot seat in 2016 when it came to light that bank employees had been opening credit card and bank accounts for people without their consent.

Since then the bank has faced a number of fines and punitive regulatory actions including an asset cap which prevents it from growing its balance sheet. It was also rumored that Buffett didn't like the bank's hiring of Wall Street veteran Charlie Scharf as CEO in 2019 even though Scharf appears to be doing a decent job. The sale ends more than three decades of Berkshire owning the stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YW1mb3JkYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL3JlYWxlc3RhdGUvYXJ0aWNsZS9MYXVyZWwtUm9hZC1jdC1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWJvd2xpbmctbW92aWUtMTc2NTcxMjIucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$5.9M New Canaan estate has indoor basketball court golf simulator and bowling lane,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/realestate/article/Laurel-Road-ct-basketball-bowling-movie-17657122.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YW1mb3JkYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL3JlYWxlc3RhdGUvYXJ0aWNsZS9MYXVyZWwtUm9hZC1jdC1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWJvd2xpbmctbW92aWUtMTc2NTcxMjIucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzE3L3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0cy1wb3J0Zm9saW8taXMtaW4tY29uc3VtZXItc3RhcGxlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11.5% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in These 2 Consumer Staples Stocks,"The market closely follows the investments of Berkshire Hathaway the company that Buffett runs.

It should come as no surprise that nearly all investors -- from retail traders to those working at hedge funds -- closely follow the moves of Warren Buffett and his company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%).

After all between 1965 and 2021 Berkshire's stock generated a compound annual gain of more than 20% while the broader benchmark S&P 500 has only compounded at a rate of 10.5% including dividends. Berkshire's stock has also soundly beaten the market this year.

Part of the reason for Berkshire's outperformance is due to its large equities portfolio which is currently valued at more than $332 billion. While a lot of investors know about some of the biggest positions in Berkshire's portfolio such as Apple what they may not know is that just two consumer staples stocks currently make up a little over 11.5% of Berkshire's entire portfolio.

Let's take a look.

Coca-Cola: $25.6 billion (7.7%) of invested assets

Buffett and Berkshire have plenty of notable names in their equity portfolio but few have the brand power of beverage giant Coca-Cola (KO 0.60%). Buffett first bought shares of Coca-Cola in 1988 and now it's the fourth-largest position in his portfolio.

When you have a great brand like Coca-Cola it makes it easier for management to pass its higher costs of running the business on to consumers without too much of an impact on sales which can enhance the company's ability to weather inflation.

In the third quarter Coca-Cola management saw success with this strategy boosting prices by 12% in the quarter. Unit case volume was also up 4% implying that sales stayed strong despite the price increases. Net revenue rose 10% in the quarter and earnings grew 14%. Furthermore management raised the company's full-year guidance.

In recent years Coca-Cola has really focused on building out a strong line of beverages that its customers simply can't get enough of and will always want to drink regardless of whether there is a recession or high inflation. There is still a lot of uncertainty in the environment that could impact demand next year including a recession but so far so good.

Kraft Heinz: $13.2 billion (3.9%) of invested assets

Just as you've likely heard of Coca-Cola you've probably also heard of food conglomerate Kraft Heinz (KHC 1.48%) due to its famous and beloved products such as Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and Heinz ketchup.

Berkshire currently owns 26.6% of all outstanding shares of the company so although it's not the biggest position in its portfolio it's up there in terms of the total stake it owns in the company.

Berkshire first invested in Heinz in 2013 teaming up with 3G Capital to purchase the company for $23 billion. In 2015 Heinz merged with Kraft and shares debuted for around $71. Today those shares trade for less than $40 and Kraft Heinz is viewed as one of Buffett's largest mistakes having paid too high a purchase price.

Kraft Heinz has a lot of debt but management has been more aggressively paying it down in recent years. The company has been doing this by selling off business units and lowering its dividend although it still has a healthy 4% annual yield.

There's still a long way to go but investors are getting more confident about Kraft Heinz's ability to continue to lower debt. The stock trades at less than 15 times forward earnings which isn't necessarily cheap but also not crazy expensive when you think about some of the brands the company has.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVudmlsbGVvbmxpbmUuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvZ3ZuMTE3MjAz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joanne Patterson Beresh Obituary - The Greenville News,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.greenvilleonline.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /obituaries/gvn117203 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D802BACB0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVudmlsbGVvbmxpbmUuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvZ3ZuMTE3MjAz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vY2FuZHlzZGlydC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8xNy9lYmJ5LWhhbGxpZGF5LWNvbXBhbmllcy1uYW1lZC1uby0xLW5vcnRoLXRleGFzLWJyb2tlcmFnZS1ieS1kYWxsYXMtYnVzaW5lc3Mtam91cm5hbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ebby Halliday Companies Named No. 1 North Texas Brokerage by Dallas Business Journal - CandysDirt.com,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vY2FuZHlzZGlydC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8xNy9lYmJ5LWhhbGxpZGF5LWNvbXBhbmllcy1uYW1lZC1uby0xLW5vcnRoLXRleGFzLWJyb2tlcmFnZS1ieS1kYWxsYXMtYnVzaW5lc3Mtam91cm5hbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D802BA5F0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

8. Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14

Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) operates as a resource company in the United States and Argentina primarily exploring for lithium deposits. The company was incorporated in 2007 and is headquartered in Vancouver Canada. In the beginning of November Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) announced plans to separate its North American and Argentine business units into two independent public companies. It is one of the best battery stocks to buy for next year. The lithium miner has several ongoing projects in the U.S. and Argentina while lithium faces potential supply shortages due to the huge EV demand which will benefit the stock.

On December 15 Piper Sandler analyst Charles Neivert reiterated an Overweight rating on Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $36 from $38. As a result of the high electric vehicle costs and a slight easing in the short-term lithium demand growth rate the analyst modestly lowered earnings estimates for the company. However the new target still factors in meaningful upside for the stock since lithium ""will essentially be sold out for the foreseeable future"" the analyst wrote in a research note.

According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data 14 hedge funds were long Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) compared to 9 funds in the prior quarter. Jay Chen’s Himension Capital held the leading stake in the company comprising 3.26 million shares worth $85.6 million.

Here is what Massif Capital has to say about Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:

“Lithium Americas: The volatility noted above in LAC has resulted in solid returns via our options trades around our core equity position. At the current time we are short calls on LAC as we have done multiple times throughout the position’s life expiring on May 21 2021 at a $17.5 and $22.5 strike price. The volume of contracts sold at each strike corresponds to the size of the equity position we want should the calls expire in the money and the underlying equity gets called away from us. The thought process behind this trade construction is that if we know the size of the position we want at a particular price point there is no reason not to accumulate additional returns by pre-selling the stock we would have sold anyway. High levels of volatility positively impact the price of options increasing the premium we can earn from selling covered calls. To date we have sold covered calls on LAC that have expired worthless four times yielding a roughly 7% return on the equity position’s current value of 71 bps for the portfolio overall. The outstanding covered calls appear to be trending towards a similar worthless expiration. If they do the covered call trades on LAC will result in us owning the shares with committed capital of -$0.28 per share. Although we believe in the fullness of time LAC warrants a $30+ valuation the prices achieved in early January of this year were not justified by the underlying fundamentals. Some will argue we should have sold down our position. We had already established our option positions and believe LAC is an emerging major in the lithium mining industry. Thus we decided to maintain the position unchanged. Although still relatively high the current $15 per share valuation is not crazy compared to where we think the firm should be trading based on fundamentals so we are no longer overly concerned with the position as is. LAC management also took advantage of the volatility issuing stock on January 22 for $22 a share. The ~$400 million in proceeds will be used to develop Thacker Pass the US-based clay lithium deposit which will likely be the largest producing Lithium mine in America when turned on. In our opinion the stock issuance could not have come at a better time. LAC management has advanced the project through various development stages (de-risking) but with the share issuance they have significantly reduced the need to bring in an outside partner to develop the asset as the first phase of the project is expected to cost roughly $581 million. After-tax and at an 8% discount rate the Thacker Pass project’s present value is approximately $2.6 billion (the firm’s current market capitalization is $1.5 billion). Although the share issuance was dilutive increasing the total shares by 17% we believe it will in the long run prove a forward-looking value-additive decision by management. The lithium market remains an area of interest and focus for us. This reflects our belief that the most exciting investment opportunities to capture secular trends in EV’s and batteries are found upstream in the mining industry. It is also a reflection that there is a greater diversity of lithium investment opportunities relative to other battery metals.”

7. Solid Power Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15

Solid Power Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) was founded in 2011 and is headquartered in Louisville Colorado. The company is engaged in the development and commercialization of all-solid-state battery cells and solid electrolyte materials for the battery-powered electric vehicle market in the United States. It is one of the premier battery stocks to buy heading into 2023. Solid Power Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP)’s Q3 revenue of $2.81 million climbed 346% year-over-year beating market estimates by $2.07 million. Solid Power Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) expects to have total cash cash equivalents marketable securities and long-term investments of between $460 million to $470 million at the end of this year.

On December 14 Citi analyst P.J. Juvekar initiated coverage of Solid Power Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) with a Neutral rating and a $3 price target. Solid-state batteries while promising face a challenging path to commercialization by 2026 with potential for delays and technology risk the analyst told investors in a research note. Longer term there is no doubt that the Inflation Redaction Act bill will quicken EV adoption in the U.S. and automakers will be keen to bring new technologies like solid state noted the analyst.

According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database 15 hedge funds were long Solid Power Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) compared to 17 funds in the preceding quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group held the largest position in the company consisting of 688515 shares worth $3.6 million.

Each share is being offered at $11.50 per share and the gross proceeds to FREYR from the offering are expected to be $230 million.

On October 31 Cowen analyst Gabe Daoud initiated coverage of FREYR Battery (NYSE:FREY) with an Outperform rating and no price target. Lithium-ion battery tailwinds have only increased in the last year due to supportive policies and additional auto announcements and battery JVs underscoring the significance of battery supply chains the analyst told investors. He called FREYR Battery (NYSE:FREY) ""a de-SPAC that has less technology risk than other startups"" noting that it stands out as a well-positioned advanced lithium-ion battery company.

According to Insider Monkey’s data 22 hedge funds were long FREYR Battery (NYSE:FREY) at the end of September 2022 compared to 16 funds in the prior quarter.

This process is called additive manufacturing meaning that material is added not removed.

With 3D printing you create a 3D digital design in a 3D modeling program known as CAD software and then use a 3D printer to produce layers of material to form the finished object. Businesses researchers medical professionals hobbyists and more use 3D printing for a range of applications.

Here's a look at how 3D printing came to be how it works what it's used for and what the future holds for this technology.

3D printing might be part of your favorite movie. Props in movies such as Black Panther Iron Man The Avengers and Star Wars use 3D printing allowing set designers to create and recreate props easily and inexpensively.

The History (and Future) of 3D Printing

In the early 1980s 3D printing technology appeared but it was known as rapid prototyping technology or RP. In 1980 Dr. Kodama of Japan filed a patent application for RP technology but the process wasn't completed.

In 1984 Charles ""Chuck"" Hull invented a process he called stereolithography which used UV light to solidify material and create a 3D object layer by layer. In 1986 Hull was issued a patent for his stereolithography apparatus or SLA machine.

Chuck Hull went on to form 3D Systems Corporation one of the largest 3D tech companies in the world.

Other 3D printing processes and technologies were being developed around the same time and further enhancements continued throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Still the primary focus of 3D printing technology was prototyping and industrial applications.

3D printing technology started to get noticed by the mainstream media in 2000 when the first 3D-printed kidney was created though the successful transplant of a 3D kidney didn't happen until 2013. In 2004 the RepRap Project had a 3D printer print out another 3D printer. More media attention was drawn in 2008 with the first 3D-printed prosthetic limb.

Other 3D advances rapidly followed including a 3D-printed house a family moved into in 2018.

Today 3D printing isn't only about prototypes and industrial manufacturing. Hobbyists scientists and everyone in between use 3D printing for product manufacturing consumer goods medical advances educational materials and more. It's fast becoming more useful for the everyday consumer.

Oscar Adelman CEO of Remi says that the process is becoming more popular in the dental industry for example. The accuracy of 3D printing is incredibly impressive and can help dental customers save as much as 80 percent on products compared to traditional dental office pricing.

""As printing technology becomes faster cheaper and more commonplace we will see industries like the dental sector rely more heavily on the technology for everyday procedures"" he says.

4D printing is on its way as well with printed objects that can change shape over time.

How 3D Printers Work

There are several types of 3D printing technologies including Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) also known as Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF). FDM is the most common and popular method and is used in most affordable 3D printers.

The FDM printing method uses a filament of plastic material a bit like a string. The filament is fed from a roll into a heated head which melts the plastic. The head extrudes the melted plastic onto the bed of the machine. The head moves over the bed in 2D depositing the first layer of material.

Once the first layer is complete the head is moved up by the thickness of the first layer and it deposits the next layer on top. The part is built up layer-by-layer like baking a loaf of bread slice by slice.

Popular FDM 3D printers include MakerBot and Ultimaker.

Example of How to Use a 3D Printer

Here's a look at how simple 3D printing might work on an FDM printer.

Download a 3D model you want to print or design one yourself. Find downloadable models on Thingiverse or GrabCAD. To design a model yourself try SketchUp or Blender. For engineering parts try CAD software such as SolidWorks. If it isn't already convert the model into a 3D printing format such as an STL file. Import the model into slicing software such as MakerWare Cura or Simplify 3D. MakerWare works with MakerBot 3D Printers. Cura and Simplify 3D produce G-code which works with most 3D printers. Configure the build in the slicing software. Decide how to orientate the model on the 3D printer. For FDM minimize overhangs steeper than 45 degrees because these require support structures. When deciding on the orientation consider how the model will be loaded so layers don't separate easily. Marina Skoropadskaya / Getty Images To save time and materials models are generally not solid. Specify the infill percentage (typically 10 to 35 percent) the number of perimeter layers (typically 1 or 2) and the number of bottom and top layers (typically 2 to 4). There are other things to consider when preparing a model for 3D printing. Export the program which is typically a G-code file. The slicing software converts the model and the build configuration you specified into a set of instructions. The 3D printer follows this to build the part. Transfer the program to the 3D printer using an SD card USB or Wi-Fi. Print the model on the 3D printer. vgajic / Getty Images When the 3D printer finishes building the model remove it and possibly also clean it. Break off any support structures and rub off any remaining lumps with fine sandpaper.

Other Types of 3D Printing Machines

Other than FDM printers 3D printing methods also include stereolithography (SLA) Digital Light Processing (DLP) Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) Selective Laser Melting (SLM) Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) and Digital Beam Melting (EBM).

SLA is the oldest 3D printing technology and is still in use today. DLP uses lighting as well as polymers while SLS uses a laser as a power supply to create strong 3D-printed objects. SLM LOM and EBM have largely fallen out of favor.

The Future of 3D Printing

Will 3D printing lead to a future of on-demand customized products instantly made to our exact specifications? While this remains unclear 3D printing technology is growing rapidly and being used in many areas.

Tariq Fancy accused his former boss and the chief executive of the world’s biggest money manager of failing to engage with criticism of BlackRock’s environmental social and governance (ESG) position and turning the $106bn (£87bn) company into a “political football”.

He told The Telegraph: “Larry Fink should stop ducking the fight and enter the [ESG] debate to clarify what he’s saying. If he’s not going to do that then he should resign.

“You can’t show the world that the emperor has no clothes if he locks himself in the bathroom and doesn’t come out.”

The broadside comes just a week after a small British activist investor also called for Mr Fink to quit accusing him of “hypocrisy” over the company’s ESG strategy.

Meanwhile BlackRock continues to face attacks from Republicans in the US over its commitment to so-called ethical investing with politicians accusing the money manager of pursuing a “woke” agenda.

Last month the state of Florida pulled $2bn from BlackRock and announced further plans to withdraw more funds last week in the latest backlash against its sustainability drive.

Mr Fancy said: “BlackRock’s biggest mistake was getting involved in political issues. When they started talking about ESG it wasn’t objective it was intended to sell to progressives.

“They’ve now found themselves in a place where they’re a political football and there’s no way to satisfy either side.”

BlackRock which manages nearly $8 trillion in assets has seen long-term net inflows of almost $250bn this year amid difficult economic conditions.

The company has been attacked from both sides over its ESG stance with activist Bluebell Capital saying the company was not doing enough in terms of sustainability and had “alienated clients and attracted an undesired level of negative publicity”. Bluebell only owns a 0.01pc stake in BlackRock.

Earlier this year Mr Fink said BlackRock would not act as “the environmental police” as it announced that it was likely to vote against most shareholder resolutions brought by climate lobbyists pursuing a ban on new oil and gas production. Previously Mr Fink sought to position BlackRock as a leader in ESG investing.

A spokesman for BlackRock said: “Tariq Fancy has been gone from BlackRock longer than he spent at the firm but three years later continues to trade on BlackRock’s name.

“It’s absurd that he would suggest a chief executive step down who has delivered a cumulative total return to shareholders over 23 years of 7700pc – the best performing financial firm in the S&P over that time – by consistently putting clients’ interests first.

“The money BlackRock manages doesn’t belong to Tariq Fancy or anyone else with a political agenda – it belongs to our clients. We will continue to manage that money consistent with their long-term goals and objectives not those of Tariq Fancy.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5pZS9zcG9ydC9ydWdieS9pdHMtdW5iZWxpZXZhYmxlLWJsYWNrcm9ja3MtYnJpbGxpYW50LWVueWEtYnJlZW4tcmVsaXNoaW5nLWNoYW5nZS1vZi1mb3J0dW5lLXdpdGgtd29tZW5zLWFpbC13aW4vNDIyMjg5ODYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'It's unbelievable' – Blackrock's brilliant Enya Breen relishing change of fortune with women's AIL win,"Blackrock College players Enya Breen (left) Emma Hooban and Laura Feely celebrate after their side’s victory in the Energia AIL Women’s Division final against Railway Union at Energia Park.Photo: Seb Daly/Sportsfile

There might be players with bigger and more established reputations in Irish women’s rugby who deservedly found their names on various end-of-season award lists but if you want a common link between some of the high points of 2022 then you’ll find the name of a 23-year-old from Skibbereen Co Cork.

Enya Breen was named player of the match in the Women’s AIL final in Donnybrook on Saturday after guiding Blackrock College to their first title since 2008. It consolidated a season in which Breen has been involved in some of the year’s finer moments.

She was the player who scored the injury-time try and added the conversion to salvage a dramatic 15-14 win for Ireland over Scotland in the final game of this year’s Women’s Six Nations in April in Belfast which guaranteed Ireland a fourth-place finish in the table rather than face the unthinkable wooden spoon.

​In what had been a tough championship and seven-month period the absence of that Breen moment could have floored the national team even more. She was among the players who helped save it.

Breen was also a player central to Ireland’s 57-22 win over Japan in their opening Test on the historic first summer tour in August.

She may not have scored a hat-trick like Neve Jones but she was an influential performer at 12. Her impressive stats included 10 carries and three defenders beaten while she helped rookie out-half Dannah O’Brien in a role as an impressive second playmaker.

And then the icing to the end of the year. Breen was the out-half who ran the play for Blackrock College in a 27-7 win over Railway Union in the women’s club showpiece in front of 467 spectators in the refixed final in Energia Park.

There will be missed kicks she’ll regret but Breen finished with a try a conversion a try assist and came up with big moments in open play.

“It’s unbelievable to be honest” an almost breathless Breen said after their win. “(Blackrock) came off the back of losing a final last year. I lost a final with Bohs three years ago to Railway as well. To put one over on Railway – they’ve been the top team in the country in the last two or three years. To finally do that is great.”

When Blackrock lost the AIL final to Railway in February this year Breen watched the game from the stand. She was playing with UL Bohemians but made the switch to Blackrock for this season as she became one of the 15s players to start with the IRFU women’s high-performance programme. And her development was evident as she became a key-note performer in this AIL final.

She had an assist for the first try of the game which started with her clever back-field kick. She also delivered a skip pass to Maeve Liston to put the winger over after five minutes.

​For her try Breen powered past a handful of Railway defenders in the second half to score Blackrock’s third five-pointer. It effectively ended this game as a contest.

Ireland head coach Greg McWilliams was there to watch the final from the stand. There’s a big year coming up in 2023 between the Six Nations and the new WXV competition and Breen wants to be in that selection mix.

“Yeah obviously it’s going to be a big season and a big year. It’s going to be a long year as well. If I can get back into that squad back into that jersey that’s where I want to be” Breen said. “I’m loving playing at the moment and hopefully I can keep that going as long as I can.”

The star quality of Béibhinn Parsons and Amee-Leigh Murphy Crowe would have undoubtedly added to the occasion but others did stand out.

Dorothy Wall was playing in an all-international back-row for Blackrock and she had two carries in the build-up to her own try in the second half. Her potential remains huge. While Scuffil-McCabe was a live-wire presence for Railway which she illustrated with her try. She’s another who should add to her internationl cap count next year.

Bring it on."

Adstiladrin nadofaragene firadenovec from Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S will be commercially available in the U.S. in 2H23 following its approval by on Friday more than two years after CMC issues led the agency to issue a complete response letter (CRL). The approval comes two months after Ferring assumed control of FerGene Inc the entity it set up in 2019 with Blackstone Life Sciences to commercialize the non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) treatment. Adstiladrin comprises an intravesically administered non-replicating adenovirus which engages the biosynthesis of interferon alfa-2b protein in the bladder.

Does Vici own everything now? Can you please give us a rundown of what Vici owns and who pays rent and how much?

A:

On the east side of the Strip Vici owns Venetian/Palazzo Harrah's and MGM Grand; on the west Mirage Caesars Palace Park MGM Excalibur Luxor New York-New York and Mandalay Bay.

Vici is the landlord for all these properties while MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment own the operations.

Vici also owns 30-odd other casino properties around the U.S. including Harrah's Laughlin and Lake Tahoe; Harvey's Lake Tahoe; Harrah's in Council Bluffs North Kansas City New Orleans Gulf Coast Metropolis Joliet Atlantic City and Philadelphia; and several Horseshoes MGMs Caesars and others. More than half of the rent that Vici collects comes from outside of Las Vegas.

As you mention Vici owned only half of MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay but it bought the other half from Blackstone recently. Blackstone still owns Bellagio and the Cosmopolitan whose operations are owned by MGM Resorts.

As to how much rent Vici collects with the MBay/MGM acquisition it's nearing $3 billion per year. Breaking down exactly who pays exactly what for each property is beyond what we can do but here are some examples.

MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay will pay $310 million. Venetian/Palazzo pays $250 million a year. The Mirage which will be owned by Hard Rock starting tomorrow now that the Gaming Commission approved the sale (on Friday) will pay $90 million.

Vici is a publicly traded company. You can buy its stock and own a piece of all these casino renters. The stock as of this writing is trading around $34.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuaW4vdGhlbGlmZS9uZXdzL3RoZS1uZXctbWlzcy1hbWVyaWNhLXdpbm5lci1kb2VzbnQtYmVsaWV2ZS1jb250ZXN0YW50cy1zaG91bGQtYmUtbWFycmllZC1vci1oYXZlLWNoaWxkcmVuL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2Mjg3OTMyLmNtc9IBogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuaW4vdGhlbGlmZS9uZXdzL3RoZS1uZXctbWlzcy1hbWVyaWNhLXdpbm5lci1kb2VzbnQtYmVsaWV2ZS1jb250ZXN0YW50cy1zaG91bGQtYmUtbWFycmllZC1vci1oYXZlLWNoaWxkcmVuL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjI4NzkzMi5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The new Miss America winner doesn't believe contestants should be married or have children,"Miss Wisconsin Grace Stanke won Miss America 2023 on Thursday night.

Stanke told Insider she stands by the rule that contestants can't be married or have children.

Mothers and married women currently can't compete for Miss America and Grace Stanke who was crowned the new winner on Thursday doesn't believe those rules should change.

Stanke represented Wisconsin during the pageant which took place at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville Connecticut.

While speaking with Insider on Friday Stanke said she believes the Miss America winner shouldn't be married or have children because it's a demanding role.

""It is Miss America and we are aged 18 to 26 and it's described in the contract right now that you have to be unmarried"" Stanke told Insider. ""We spend a lot of time on the road.""

She added: ""The position of Miss America is an incredibly demanding one requiring an average of 20000 miles of travel monthly and visiting cities across the country for no more than 48 hours at a time.""

""It's a very rigorous position and I'm excited to be in the role and excited to step into it"" Stanke said.

Stanke also credited Miss America for helping pay for her education. She has received almost $70000 in scholarship funds from the organization and said attending graduate school is now an option.

""The Miss America organization awards $5 million a year to women all across the country and that's changing lives"" Stanke said. ""Receiving an education is allowing me to continue pursuing my career as a nuclear engineering student and a future nuclear energy advocate.""

It was announced earlier this year that married women and mothers would be allowed to compete in Miss USA and Miss Universe for the first time starting in 2023. It was a major change one that Miss Universe 2020 Andrea Meza told Insider was a long time coming.

Brian Lowe a spokesperson for the Miss America organization told Insider there are no plans to change the rule ""at this time.""

Stanke isn't the first Miss America winner to stand by the organization's rule. Camille Schrier who won the title of Miss America 2020 also told Insider at the time that she doesn't believe contestants in the competition should be married or have children.

""I think that Miss America is a very unique job and quite honestly I'm worried about what I'm going to do with my cats at home right now when I take this job and I'm on the road constantly"" Schrier said.

Both Schrier and Miss Georgia 2020 Victoria Hill said during the Miss America broadcast that they believe the pageant winner should be single and have no children. Karamo Brown and Kelly Rowland who were judges for that year's competition later spoke out against their answers.

""I felt it was important that there be a counter-voice in case there is a mother out there who is watching this because we never know the circumstances of how anyone becomes a parent"" Brown said.

""If there's one young parent who is in college and trying to get her degree or just working and wants to be in the Miss America pageant I felt like it was important for her to know that she can do it and that there are no limitations"" he continued.

""I was so happy that Karamo said that"" Rowland said. ""We're approaching our next decade in 2020. We can do whatever whenever and however we want we make the rules.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdmVybWlsaW9uY291bnR5Zmlyc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTgvaXJvbi1taWtlcy13ZWxjb21lcy1uZXctb3duZXJzaGlwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iron Mike's Welcomes New Ownership,"THE FOLLOWING IS A VERMILION ADVANTAGE RELEASE

This past week the airline placed an order with Boeing for 100 wide-body 787 Dreamliner jets with another 100 options.

It was the biggest single order for wide-body jets ever placed by a U.S. airline United said and will carry the airline through its fleet renewal and expansion plans through the next decade.

As part of the order United also exercised options for additional 737 MAX aircraft while placing a new order for even more of the narrow-body jets.

United and Boeing teamed up to throw a big event at the plane-maker's Dreamliner assembly plant in Charleston South Carolina to mark the order signing with appearances by Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal most of United's C-suite — including CEO Scott Kirby — and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.

But underneath the dignitary-laden splash lies a high-stakes dynamic as United charts its strategy through the mid-2030s a gamble with huge potential upside but also one with high risks and costs if the airline misjudged the situation.

United Airlines' splashy announcements

Such events and using a grandiose ""historic"" announcement to outline a business plan have become the standard M.O. at United largely to its benefit as it's dominated aviation headlines in recent years.

Last year for instance even as the airline industry was still struggling to claw its way back to profitability from the lows of the pandemic United held a boisterous event at its Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) hub to announce its ""United Next"" plan: a road map to reconfigure its capacity and fleet which included an order for 270 narrow-body jets the largest-ever single order by a U.S. carrier.

This week's event did not involve the reveal of a new cabin or product but still saw the airline go big with a heavy media and marketing push even chartering one of its own 737 MAX 8 aircraft to fly its army of employee-influencers — staffers from work groups across the airline who use their personal social media accounts to promote the airline with their employer's tacit guidance — to Charleston to share images and videos. The Boeing assembly line in Charleston meanwhile came to a brief halt as employees left their stations to don matching blue T-shirts and sit in the plane-maker's gigantic hangar.

DAVID SLOTNICK/THE POINTS GUY

While United's CEO clearly enjoys being seen as an industry leader and enjoys making headlines — as airline journalist Brian Sumers wrote in a recent newsletter Kirby will either be remembered as ""one of the top three most transcendent U.S. airline executives in modern memory"" or ""one of the all-time failures ... for spending billions on aircraft his airline didn't need"" — and chief communications officer Josh Earnest's team has an unparalleled ability to capture the news cycle and online virality last week's announcement is exceptionally revelatory.

Planning a fleet in turbulent times

Should the first scenario Sumers described come true it will be because Kirby led the airline through the COVID-19 pandemic and the turbulence of the years after with an incredible degree of prescience.

When United placed last year's narrow-body order travel demand was trickling back but was still far from recovered. United was still deep in the hole and did not have an obvious path to the cash flow to support any near-term capital investment. The idea of retrofitting its existing fleet with new interiors seemed wild.

But 18 months later the move seems like a good one.

Runway and other infrastructure constraints at major airports — and what are effectively slot limitations at its Newark hub — put a limit on how many flights airlines can operate. Part of United's strategy is to ""upgauge"" aircraft on many smaller routes to combine frequencies — in other words for example flying a route twice daily with a 100-seat airplane instead of operating it four times in a day with a 50-seat airplane saving two takeoff and landing slots.

DAVID SLOTNICK/THE POINTS GUY

Ongoing supply chain constraints meanwhile seem likely to last for a while longer across the global economy. With the orders in place and delivery slots secured United has a degree of relative certainty for its new aircraft assuming Boeing can stabilize its production rate. It also locks in pricing terms during a period of high inflation while the cabin retrofit plan ensures that it can continue using its existing narrow-bodies for the foreseeable future.

United thinks that the supply chain issues are something that will work out over the long run. That project to retrofit the interiors of its cabins has gone slower than it expected but is still expected to be largely finished by the middle of this decade Kirby told reporters on Tuesday at a deal-signing event at Boeing's Charleston factory.

""Not much has been done so far"" Kirby said. ""It's on track to be if not 100% complete by 2025 substantially completed by 2025.""

""There have been some supply chain [issues] but we've mostly gotten those wrestled to the ground.""

Notably it was the first time that United has suggested the project could slip beyond 2025.

It's too soon to say whether last year's order will prove to be the right call over the long run and it's far too early to see how the wide-body order holds up.

Based on the initial signs though United's reasoning for placing the order seems valid.

United tries to seize a post-pandemic advantage

International travel demand has rebounded Kirby said and there's no reason to expect it to decrease. Long-haul travel also offers United a growth opportunity that it can't quite replicate in the domestic market. Executives at United frequently point to their 2020 decision not to retire any of its wide-body fleet as allowing it to seize returning demand in the following two years and to return to a global route-building initiative.

""It really is just the next logical step on the journey that United has been on since the beginning of the pandemic"" Kirby told reporters at the event in Charleston this week referring to the new order. ""United wound up positioned on the other side of the pandemic in a totally unique way.""

United CEO Scott Kirby speaks with reporters at a signing event with Boeing. DAVID SLOTNICK/THE POINTS GUY

Kirby also said that the airline chose to place such a big order to try and seize the opportunities created by the pandemic — after all before the pandemic an order for just 50 wide-body jets would have been considered a big deal.

""The reason we went big is one we are big"" Kirby told reporters ""and we have a unique position in our hubs for international growth and I think international's going to be really strong in the years to come.""

""The structural changes that happened during COVID mean it's going to be a long time before many of our competitors can get back to growing even get back to where they were in 2019"" Kirby added. ""We start with a head start and we're going to run even harder.""

United has grown ambitiously since international borders began reopening following 2020's lockdowns trying out new and surprising destinations like Ghana Jordan and Malaga Spain.

A risky but potentially rewarding strategy

Importantly from a cost-savings perspective the 787s average about 25% better fuel efficiency per seat than United's current international fleet which offers an extra incentive to replace the older jets.

Even so airplanes are expensive and United's commitment to the 100 new wide-bodies is a large one.

At list price the order would be worth around $30 billion depending on how many of each variant United settles on. While airlines never pay full price for new aircraft and United received favorable terms — ""I'm smiling that's all I'll say on price"" Kirby laughed in response to a reporter's question in Charleston — it nevertheless is a large amount of money for a company that already has hundreds of aircraft on order. For reference United ended the third quarter of this year reporting $942 million in profit on revenue of $12.9 billion with $20.4 billion in liquid assets.

Still speaking at Tuesday's event in Charleston chief financial officer Gerry Laderman said that the airline expects no issues.

""The aircraft you build are profit machines"" he said. ""We'll make so much money with these aircraft that the more the merrier as far as I'm concerned.""

During a pre-event briefing Monday Laderman specified that the airline expects to pay for the aircraft out of its incoming revenue but said that it could choose to finance some ""to the extent we find capital market financing attractive.""

""We have the luxury of making that choice"" he added.

What ultimately will make or break United is demand over the next decade. If Kirby and the airline are correct and international demand stays strong the airline will approach the 2030s with a wide-body fleet at least as big as today's — with 100 additional planes United can opt to buy should the ""opportunity"" to expand to new routes or markets arise as Laderman said during Monday's briefing.

But if travel demand contracts or begins to look different — perhaps renewing a trend toward larger jumbojets or a hub-and-spoke preference for international travel — or if the plan to upgauge routes and decrease frequencies ends up failing then United is stuck figuring out what to do with and how to pay for 700 inbound aircraft.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS93aHktdGhlLWJvZWluZy0yNzA3LWZhaWxlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Did Boeing's Proposed Supersonic 2707 Airliner Fail?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS93aHktdGhlLWJvZWluZy0yNzA3LWZhaWxlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1YnVybi1yZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbmV3cy9ib2Vpbmcta25ldy1vZi1lbGV2YXRlZC1taXNjYXJyaWFnZS1yYXRlLWluLTgwcy1idXQtZm9sbG93dXAtZml6emxlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing knew of ‘elevated’ miscarriage rate in ’80s but followup fizzled,"Editor’s note: This is part of ongoing coverage examining the dangers of chemical exposure to Boeing workers in the Puget Sound region. According to records obtained exclusively by The Daily Herald in Everett the aerospace company has attempted to study the toxicity of chemicals used in its factories — and their potential to impact worker health — with mixed results.

AUBURN — After a series of miscarriages among her pregnant colleagues in 1985 a shop steward in Plastics Fabrication was the first to ask the troubling question.

Women in building 17.05 of the Boeing Company’s Auburn plant began to wonder if the chemicals they used were to blame. Their concerns triggered a company study.

But the answer was neither simple nor definitive.

In short Boeing’s health and safety experts found what appeared to be an “elevated” rate of miscarriages: 11 of 41 pregnancies among the cohort of study participants or about 27 percent of cases according to a health survey. The normal rate was more like 10 to 20 percent according to studies cited by Boeing.

Further analysis found the worker sample size was too small to “conclude with certainty whether or not the overall rate of miscarriage in the Auburn Plastic Bench Mechanics is higher than the overall rate of miscarriage in the general population.” A corporate memo reported that “no single agent can be identified as a cause of miscarriage in this study” but pointed to a few chemical products that were “implicated by this study as being associated with miscarriage” records show.

The Environmental Protection Agency reviewed the results of the miscarriage study and opined that it warranted further research. However according to depositions of Boeing officials this year that follow-up never happened.

The internal documents were among hundreds of pages of historical company records discussed in the depositions taken in a series of lawsuits claiming Boeing factory employees sustained reproductive harm from chemicals they handled on the job. The exposure resulted in “catastrophic” birth defects in the workers’ children born between 1980 and 2014 the lawsuits allege. The families’ attorneys suspect there are many more people who suffer from lifelong health problems or genetic disorders because of the toxins their parents worked at Boeing manufacturing facilities during the past four decades.

Over the years Boeing has tried to analyze the health repercussions of industrial poisons routinely used by its workforce the records show. Yet some of these efforts fizzled before reaching any firm conclusions.

Company epidemiologists spent years building the foundation for a database to find links between specific chemicals employees used and workers’ health ailments according to the testimony of Dr. J. Michael Muhm manager of epidemiology for Boeing from 1987 to 1992.

But as Muhm explained in a June 7 deposition “it was very very difficult to link the chemicals with which employees worked to the employees.”

“It was not something that was reasonably done on a corporate-wide — or on a company basis” said Muhm who worked for Boeing until he retired in 2010. “… I think this was an intent but I don’t believe we were ever successful at creating this database.”

The documents underscore the complexities of understanding the harm workers could suffer — and possibly pass on to their children.

“One of the realities of industrial workplaces is that unless the company chooses to do a study to determine whether the chemicals it’s using are causing adverse effects amongst its workers and the children of its workers then it’s very hard for regulators and the scientific community to know what is going on and what health effects are occurring” said plaintiff’s attorney Michael Connett a partner at Waters Kraus & Paul who specializes in birth defect litigation.

That’s a massive conflict of interest he explained.

If a study provides evidence that chemicals cause harm “then the company is inviting liability” Connett said. “So companies are disincentivized from doing studies that would bring to light the full spectrum of consequences of the chemicals it handles.”

Boeing has declined to comment on the lawsuits and depositions citing company policy.

In court filings the company has argued that the children’s birth defects were not caused by chemicals in its facilities and that it has always taken measures to protect its employees from potential health hazards.

In October the company reached terms on an out-of-court settlement with one of the plaintiffs a North Bend woman born with a heart defect in 1980 when her mother worked at a Boeing Field factory.

Two other lawsuits still pending were filed by the families of two men who became fathers while working as mechanics at the Everett plant.

While reporting on the litigation The Daily Herald obtained eight depositions of current and former employees including more than a hundred exhibits of corporate memos reports and scientific studies discussed by high-ranking company officials over the past 40 years.

‘Baseline data’

As early as the 1940s there was recognition in the medical community that pregnant women are more sensitive to industrial chemicals than the general population.

A top doctor at Boeing warned the company president in 1980 of the disastrous potential of a long list of chemicals and urged improvements to the “industrial hygiene” program The Herald has reported.

But the suggestion wasn’t well received by then-President Malcolm Stamper noted Dr. Barry Dunphy then the company’s occupational health manager. Dunphy remarked that Stamper “did not appear at all sympathetic or indeed faintly happy” about having “this organizational problem brought to his attention” the deposition records show.

The Auburn Reproductive Health Survey marked a recognition by the company in July 1986 that more information was needed about the harmful effects of chemicals in use at its workplace.

Despite growing concerns about reproductive hazards childbearing women and their partners might encounter on the job the survey noted “many chemicals have not been studied for reproductive health effects.”

“The reasons for lack of information on reproductive effects of chemicals include insufficient data from animal experiments on most commercial chemicals and the difficulty of collecting valid information from studies of human populations exposed to chemicals” says the survey report written by a company epidemiologist.

The Auburn plant study considered dozens of chemicals including some organic solvents already suspected of being dangerous to the reproductive system. On the list were toluene xylene petroleum distillates and methyl ethyl ketone — some of the same organic solvents named in the recent birth defect lawsuits.

Following the initial 1986 survey Boeing began evaluating more of its materials for the potential to cause reproductive harm to mothers and fathers working in its factories records show. An internal report drafted in 1987 outlined the company’s plan to build a list and “continue to add to our information profile” as scientific knowledge advanced.

“At the same time an increasing number of chemicals are being introduced into the workplace and new industrial processes/tasks are utilized” says the report. “Evaluation of potential exposure should keep pace with these developments and this represents the baseline data upon which future studies can be performed.”

‘Study the relationship’

Two years after the first report on the Auburn plant miscarriages the company’s corporate health and safety manager documented mixed conclusions about the data in a 1988 memo addressed to the Auburn Human Relations and the Auburn Executive Safety Council.

“The overall rate of miscarriage in the organizations included in this study is not conclusively higher than that in the general population but the results of this study do more to support that contention than to refute it” says a draft of the memo.

Chemicals associated with higher rates of miscarriage included solvent components in “Frekote 700” a parting compound and “Scotchweld adhesive film AF 163-2K.” Miscarriages were also clustered among women whose jobs involved heavy lifting.

The memo noted the study’s limitations including its small size. It also only accounted for “medically confirmed” pregnancies so it could have missed early-term miscarriages.

“My understanding of the conclusion of the study was that there wasn’t a significant difference in the number of miscarriages in this group compared to the general population” said Boeing Senior Toxicologist Brittany Weldon when she was deposed to speak on the company’s behalf in August.

She was not aware of any further study of the miscarriages.

But according to the January 1988 memo Boeing had plans to revisit the issue.

“The Boeing Company is currently developing an Employee Health and Safety Module as part of the Integrated Employee Record System a computerized data base which will enhance our ability to study the relationship between exposure to various hazardous agents and adverse medical outcomes” wrote M. H. Stewart Boeing’s corporate safety and health manager in the memo. “When this system is functional a study of the Auburn area will be repeated to reassess the rate of miscarriage in Plastic Bench Mechanics.”

That spring Boeing also shared these plans with the EPA when disclosing the Auburn study results as required by the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act. The EPA asked Boeing to report back with any further findings and suggested that there were other outcomes such as low birth rate that Boeing could examine for signs of reproductive harm.

“Boeing’s investigations demonstrate the difficulty involved in studying reproductive hazards in the workplace” says an EPA report from April 1988.

“Although it cannot be determined that any particular chemical exposure or process or workplace activity was the cause of miscarriages among the employees at this Boeing facility” the report continues “the studies do signal the need for a more extensive examination of the rate of miscarriages at the facility and suggest the need for a monitoring program for workplace exposure to numerous chemicals.”

‘White with dust’

In the 1980s and 1990s Boeing faced mounting pressure for more information about the connection between chemicals and workforce maladies. Controversy erupted in 1987 over the use of phenol formaldehyde resin a component in a woven fiberglass cloth that the company began using that year to meet Federal Aviation Administration regulations on flammability.

Though the company discontinued the use of the chemical the following year it faced the blowback for the next decade including criticism for its handling of related workers compensation claims and scrutiny from regulators. A lawsuit brought by sickened workers led to a landmark state Supreme Court ruling and — ultimately — a multi-million dollar settlement.

When the company began testing the new material at the Auburn plant in February 1987 a supervisor noted employees “complained of dizziness dryness in nose and throat burning eyes and upset stomach” according to court records in the lawsuit.

There was an “obnoxious odor” according to the court records and the air at the production facility was “white with dust.” The supervisor remarked that he expected the problem would only get worse “as temperatures rise and production increases.” Records show he asked for improved ventilation but management denied the request saying odors didn’t warrant the cost of the upgrades.

The problem did indeed get worse according to court records and media reports. Workers started to pass out on the job.

The company discontinued the use of phenol formaldehyde in December 1988 the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported.

Dozens of workers filed claims with the company’s in-house insurance saying they had been sickened by the chemical during the short time it was in use. Boeing questioned the legitimacy of many of them.

A physician panel assembled by the company to review the claims opined in 1989 that some of the physical symptoms were likely the result of anxiety and there was no clear link between the chemical and the health problems.

The complaints fueled a growing recognition among doctors that more research was needed to understand the impact of industrial toxins on workers’ health. Some doctors adopted the term “multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome” to refer to chemically induced illness. However many in the mainstream medical community didn’t accept the term as a real diagnosis. The concept remains controversial today.

Fourteen of the Auburn factory workers took their concerns to King County Superior Court in 1991. They sued the company alleging they suffered lasting injuries and disabilities because of Boeing’s “deliberate intent to injure” and “outrageous conduct.”

The plaintiffs accused the company of removing chemical labels harassing employees who sought protective gear threatening to fire those who sought medical restrictions and using workers as human experiment subjects without their consent. They also alleged the company would clean facilities and ventilation before regulatory inspections to skew test results.

The Washington State Supreme Court remarked in a 1995 ruling that the case was the first to reach the court “in which the acts alleged go beyond gross negligence of the employer and involve willful disregard of actual knowledge by the employer of continuing injuries to employees.”

The landmark ruling in the case Birklid v. Boeing Co. expanded the ability of workers to sue companies for injuries they sustained on the job. The state’s highest court held the plaintiffs “demonstrated facts sufficient to justify a jury in finding a deliberate intention by Boeing to injure them.”

“Boeing contended that the workers were not exposed to toxic chemicals beyond safe levels” the ruling said. “The plaintiffs note however that regardless of so-called ‘safe’ levels of exposure Boeing anticipated that those levels would make its workers sick and in fact the workers became sick.”

The company settled the case out of court for an undisclosed amount according to a 1997 report by The Seattle Times. One source told The P-I it was in the millions of dollars.

‘High exposures’

Amid the controversy over phenol formaldehyde worker unions and scientific experts questioned whether regulations were enough to protect workers given that federal officials found levels of the chemical passed air quality tests at the Auburn plant.

Deposition records in the recent lawsuits also highlight potential shortfalls of regulatory limits on chemicals in workplace air — especially when it comes to birth defects.

The plaintiffs’ attorneys have argued that federally accepted standards weren’t designed to protect everyone.

As of 1991 Boeing’s Occupational Health Examination Guide for Physicians acknowledged that “the potential for adverse reproductive effects were given only minimal consideration” in establishing widely used safety limits for worker chemical exposure.

“Nevertheless if exposures are maintained within these limits the possibility of any adverse reproductive effects will be minimized” says the guide.

A 1990s-era “instructor’s guide” for Boeing’s hazard communication training advises that chemicals can still cause adverse health effects even below legal thresholds set by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

For decades OSHA has required companies to inventory their chemicals and disclose the risks of each to its workers.

“For many substances exposure below the limits can be hazardous” says the instructor’s pamphlet created to guide factory worker training. “In addition people vary a lot in their response to chemicals. There are always people who will react to even low concentrations of chemicals.”

As the pamphlet explains the only way to know if someone’s exposure to a chemical exceeds the legal limit is monitoring — by measuring the concentration of the chemical in their breathing zone.

The most effective ways to protect workers from overexposure include “replacing hazardous chemicals with safer ones” and “local exhaust ventilation are the best controls” says the guide. Boeing also instructed workers on when and how to wear personal protective equipment or PPE such as gloves and respirators.

But protective gear can only do so much the instructor’s guide says.

“It does nothing to remove chemicals from the environment” it says “so that if the PPE is no good or fails high exposures could result.”

‘A very weak type of study’

As a Renton-based corporate epidemiologist Dr. Muhm tried to find data sources to analyze the health of Boeing’s workforce in the late 1980s and early 1990s he testified. His team laid the groundwork for an analysis of employee mortality data for any “unusual” trends among the company’s employees or subgroups of workers.

“That was an end point that was fairly definite and could be used to determine if the employees of The Boeing Company had health experiences similar to the general population or higher” he explained. “… The company used a number of toxic chemicals and clearly we were interested if there was any adverse effects of those.”

The epidemiology group collected employee death certificates showing how current and former employees died he said. The group also gathered corporate illness and injury statistics as well as some health information from the employee health insurance provider.

“There were efforts to modify externally sourced databases and make them work in the Boeing environment” Muhm said. “That was an exceedingly complex and for me frustrating effort that had never (come) to pass.”

Muhm said there might also have been some “rudimentary analysis” when he was a manager of the epidemiology group but said that he did not remember the results.

“The best we could do at that point was called a proportionate mortality study where you looked at the portions of deaths out of the total number of deaths due to a certain cause and determine whether or not those proportions were similar to or different from that in a standard population and as a very — a very weak type of study” he said.

Toward the end of his time in the epidemiology group he was reassigned to a “corporate-wide search” for any documentation of negative health effects that the company had failed to turn over to regulators.

The Toxic Substances Control Act required such documents be turned over to the EPA at a price of roughly $25000 per day late per document. However the federal agency had announced an amnesty program allowing companies to turn them in without penalty according to Muhm’s testimony. Muhm said he didn’t remember exactly how many documents he gathered that met the legal reporting requirements — or what they said.

But what he found he testified was enough to save the company millions.

‘By submitted diagnosis’

From 1992 to 2000 Muhm served as manager of Boeing Occupational Health Services in the medical department. He oversaw a program “responsible for testing and monitoring health of 40000 employees” according to his curriculum vitae.

During his time in the role the company obtained employee insurance claims data from King County Medical deposition records show.

“Occupational Health Services has recently begun processing the Boeing employee insurance claims data received from King County Medical” Muhm wrote in a 1994 internal memo to the company’s medical director. “To date we have counted the numbers of employees submitting claims and the number of claims submitted by submitted diagnosis. This provides information that is of value to other physicians in Boeing Medical.”

Attached to the memo was a one-page “sample report” that listed employee claims data for 200 different cancers diseases and other health conditions from 1987-1993. However the one-page list lacks context such as the total number of employees whose data was sought or the baseline prevalence of the diagnoses in the general population.

In his deposition Muhm said he could not recall any further analysis of the data.

“Whether or not we went beyond this I don’t know” Muhm testified when asked about the numbers “but we did get access to this private insurance data.”

In the mid-1990s the company also contracted with the University of Washington to study the incidence of lung cancer among Boeing workers who used chromium.

The study did not rely on insurance claims data though. Instead the cancer data came from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Cancer Surveillance System said Muhm one of the study’s authors.

The study cost Boeing about $30000 according to a contract with the university. Boeing provided the school with employee job history data and UW agreed not to identify Boeing in the study published in 1996.

The study cohort consisted of 2500 workers who had spent at least six months in jobs involving hexavalent chromium exposure from 1974 to 1994. Among them researchers counted fifteen cases of lung cancer and four other cases of respiratory cancer.

“Although based on few cases an elevated lung cancer risk was found in subjects who had worked for 5 or more years as a chrome plater or surface processor tank tender … and sander/masker or polisher” the study concluded. “A clear association was not observed between chromate exposure and the risk of lung cancer in this population of workers.”

Today Chromium-6 or hexavalent chromium is widely considered carcinogenic to workers. According to OSHA the longer a worker is exposed the more likely they are to develop lung nasal and sinus cancer.

‘Historically exposed’

For years Boeing also collected data on employee health through “medical surveillance” or health monitoring as part of its occupational health and safety program.

According to the 1991 physicians’ exam guide these periodic examinations were required for employees who were exposed to chemicals over certain thresholds established either by law or the corporate medical director. Sometimes the exams included “biological monitoring” tests of a worker’s blood or urine.

As a result of new OSHA regulations in the 1990s Boeing was required to offer medical screenings to employees who worked with materials containing cadmium records show.

In 1994 Boeing began testing employees who were being exposed to cadmium on the job.

As of August of that year more than 500 Boeing Puget Sound employees had been tested according to an internal company memo. About 10 of those tests yielded abnormal results Muhm wrote in the memo.

“Boeing’s tested population continues to be very similar to the OSHA non exposed populations in all measures” says the memo.

With promising early results the company initially hoped to get a “variance from the requirement to identify and biomonitor historically exposed employees” records show.

But they encountered resistance from the union representative who still wanted to see testing results from employees who might have been exposed in the past. Muhm was involved in identifying who needed to be tested to comply with the new rules according to his deposition. As he confirmed in his deposition as more time passed cadmium levels measurable in those employees’ bodies would diminish.

To meet the regulations Boeing began offering medical screening to employees whose past assignments involved potential exposure to cadmium for five years or more.

In January 1995 the company started by mailing screening paperwork to “historically exposed” workers in Everett. Those results too largely came back normal records show.

But at Muhm’s recommendation employees considered “historically exposed” were given the chance to opt out of screenings.

“In this case the exposures no longer exist for historically exposed employees (or they would be currently exposed) and the information gained by the testing will have little/no effect on their health” Muhm wrote in a 1994 memo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vY2VudHJlZm9yYXZpYXRpb24uY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL3JlcG9ydHMvb2Vtcy1vbi10aGUtcGF0aC10by1yZWNvdmVyeS1hcy1haXJjcmFmdC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWFuZC1vcmRlcmluZy1yZWJ1aWxkLTYzMzE4OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OEMs on the path to recovery as aircraft production and ordering rebuild | CAPA,"Summary:

Narrowbody output growing rapidly but supply chains still not completely healthy.

Airbus to fall short of its 700 aircraft target in 2022 but committed to long term production plans.

Boeing makes further cuts to its full-year delivery target.

Ordering on the right path - with more deals closed in early Dec-2022.

Narrowbody output growing rapidly but supply chains still not completely healthy

Over the first 11 months of 2022 Airbus and Boeing delivered a combined 878 aircraft - Boeing with 409 and Airbus with 566.

Airbus' annual total has shrunk to 564 - as two A350s nominally transferred to Aeroflot Russian Airlines in Dec-2021 were subsequently 'undelivered' due to the sanctions imposed on Russia in 2022.

Narrowbody deliveries over the period which was a 93% share of overall deliveries totalled 818 aircraft.

This is well above historical norms with narrowbodies typically accounting for about 77%-80% of deliveries in a given year.

Airbus and Boeing narrowbody and widebody aircraft deliveries: Jan-2016 to Nov-2011

However pandemic-era travel recovery patterns have favoured the production of smaller aircraft - domestic and short haul international were among the earliest markets to recover whereas long haul transcontinental travel has been among the slowest to recover.

Widebody output has also suffered from the fallout from geopolitical issues production problems and several high-profile customer disputes complicating deliveries.

Airbus to fall short of 700 aircraft target in 2022 but committed to long term production plans

Airbus delivered 68 aircraft in Nov-2022 and announced in early Dec-2022 that it did not expect to meet its 2022 full-year delivery target of ""around 700"" aircraft.

However the OEM also stated that its final delivery total for the year is ""not expected to fall materially short"" of the 700 aircraft.

In a normal year Airbus is more than capable of delivering above 100 aircraft during December.

However the OEM is facing a ""complex operating environment"" and still grappling with supply chain and workforce issues - some a hangover from the pandemic and others a result of efforts to rebuild output - that are slowing delivery rates.

Airbus deliveries for the final two months of the year: 2016-2021

Year November deliveries December deliveries Two-month total 2016 61 111 172 2017 74 127 201 2018 89 127 216 2019 78 138 216 2020 64 89 153 2021 58 93 151

Airbus also announced that it would adjust the speed of the ramp-up of A320 production over 2023 and 2024. The company has ramped A320 family production from 40 to 45 aircraft per month since 3Q2021 and had been targeting reaching a rate of 65 by early 2024.

Challenges in the supply chain have meant that Airbus had already pushed this target back once (from mid-2023).

At the same time A220 build rates at the Mirabel and Mobile assembly lines have grown from five to six per month over 2022 although actual delivery numbers have not been commensurate with this increase.

Due to the A220s long supply chain - which includes significant work outsourced to China and parts of Europe - a number of aircraft remain unfinished and waiting on supplier deliveries. Because of this situation deliveries and line production rates are not expect to match up until well into 2023.

Airbus remains committed to raising A220 output to 14 per month by 2025.

At the same time the OEM is targeting a 20% reduction in supplier costs on the aircraft and reaching operational break-even on the programme.

A350 deliveries have totalled 50 aircraft mostly for the smaller A350-900. Airbus is producing on average five A350s per month and the planned increase to six per month is now unlikely until 2023 or even beyond that.

A330 production remains at just two per month with only 28 delivered to the end of Nov-2022. Production is mostly focused on the A330-900 with 17 delivered so far. The A330-900 makes up the vast majority of the A330 backlog.

Airbus has outstanding orders for 189 A330neos (five A330-800s and 184 A330-900s) and 21 A330ceos (13 A330-200s and eight A330-300s). Some of the A330ceo orders are unlikely to be filled.

Airbus somewhat unexpectedly announced plans to increase A330 output to three per month by the end of 2022 bolstered by expectations of a pick-up in ordering for the type.

Boeing makes further cuts to its full-year delivery target

During its late Oct-2022 financial results announcements Boeing trimmed its full-year delivery outlook (the second such reduction this year).

This was mostly due to the company dealing with supply chain issues in the 737 MAX programme.

CFM International is the sole engine supplier for the narrowbody family and slower than hoped for output of the LEAP-1B engine has forced Boeing to adapt.

Earlier in 2022 Boeing decided to take engines from grounded MAX airplanes - of which there are at least 150 remaining - and then installed them on new-build aircraft in a bid to get new-build aircraft to customers and to avoid producing engineless 'gliders'.

Boeing had initially been looking to deliver more than 500 of its 737 MAX aircraft in 2022 but had lowered this to the ""low 400s"".

This has now been cut again to ""around"" 375 aircraft which means Boeing hopes to deliver approximately 50 737 MAX aircraft in Dec-2022.

The US aircraft maker has also announced that 737 MAX production will be maintained at a rate of 31 per month and will stay there until the company is satisfied that the supply chain can handle a ramp-up.

The OEM had been contemplating output of 38 per month by the end of 1H2023 - but the engine situation made that untenable.

As a result the OEM has also has dropped its outlook for 737 MAX deliveries for 2022 from a little under 400 to around 375 (including deliveries of aircraft produced during the 737 MAX grounding).

Boeing 737 MAX deliveries Jan-2018 to Oct-2022

Boeing is making progress on widebodies with 12 going to customers in Nov-2022.

Key to the increase in output is the resumption of 787 shipments to airlines which occurred in early Aug-2022 after a delay of 15 months. Six went to customers in Nov-2022.



During the grounding Boeing lowered production but continued to build 787s at a rate of at least two per month leaving it with a pool of around 120 aircraft awaiting delivery.

While Boeing runs down this backlog the OEM reportedly intends to maintain 787 production at around 2 per month.

Beyond this Boeing is considering its options to return production to at least five aircraft per month.

Boeing 787 deliveries Jan-2019 to Nov-2022

Apart from the Boeing 787 the freight market has been a key market for Boeing.

Of the 63 widebodies supplied to customers in the first 11 months of 2022 39 of them have been for dedicated freighters (five 747-8Fs 16 767-300Fs and 18 777Fs).

Boeing has also confirmed that the final 747 - a 747-8F for Atlas Air - will be delivered in early 2023.

The delivery will be the 1574th for the programme putting an end to a production run at the Everett Washington facility that has covered more than 54 years.

Ordering on the right path - with more deals closed in early December

Airbus has announced 1062 new orders (gross) in 2022.

Nov-2022 ordering was subdued with just 29 new orders from six customers.

For 2022 to date Airbus has suffered 237 order cancellations pulling its net total for the first 11 months of the year to 825 aircraft.

Boeing's ordering has been solid although the OEM didn't have as much success at the 2022 Farnborough International Air Show during Jul-2022.

Boeing has logged 685 gross orders for the year to date.

This total will shoot up in Dec-2022 with the company announcing a huge order from United Airlines for 200 aircraft (100 new 787s and 100 737 MAX aircraft including exercising 44 purchase options and new orders for 56 more).

Airbus and Boeing gross orders for Jan-2022 to Nov-2022

Even with the recent cuts to delivery targets the major OEMs are set to deliver more than 1000 aircraft to airlines in 2022 which is an increase of at least 25% over 2021.

Orders are set to end the year close to 2000 aircraft - which would be the best year for new orders since 2016."

The company operationally based in Fridley has been hit with 11 Class I recalls in 2022 and 12 in 2021 — far more than usual. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration reserves its Class I status for the most serious life-threatening medical device problems.

For comparison between 2017 and 2020 Medtronic averaged about five Class I recalls a year.

Seven of the company's 23 recalls in the last two years are related to the HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device (HVAD) that Medtronic acquired in 2016. Four of those recalls were in 2021; three were this year.

""Acquired products (such as HVAD) have been the biggest contributor to Class I … growth"" said Erika Winkels a spokeswoman for Medtronic. ""Improvements have been made to our process for assessing and integrating acquired products to reduce the contribution of acquired products to product quality issues moving forward.""

As of June 2021 when Medtronic stopped selling the beleaguered product the company said 14 deaths had been linked to defects with the HVAD device. So far Medtronic's 2022 recalls are linked to a small number of deaths.

The uptick in recalls at the world's largest medical device maker is troubling to many.

""Clearly there's a problem when a company has this many recalls — Class I recalls on important potentially life-saving devices"" said Diana Zuckerman president of Washington D.C.-based National Center for Health Research a nonprofit think tank that works to improve the safety and effectiveness of medical products.

Medtronic bet big on HVAD technology when it acquired Massachusetts-based HeartWare International Inc. for $1.1 billion in 2016. But it has cost Medtronic just as much to unspool the product's string of legal and regulatory problems. According to details in a financial filing earlier this year Medtronic has taken $1.1 billion in charges connected to exiting the HVAD business.

Acquiring technology from other companies Zuckerman said does not absolve Medtronic of its device safety responsibilities. She said one issue stems from the way the FDA regulates medical devices many of which — unlike pharmaceuticals — are not required to submit any clinical trial data prior to approval.

""That is a known weakness of the FDA but it does put the onus on the company"" she said. ""Regardless of what FDA requires them to do companies should be really careful making sure their product is safe.""

When the pandemic hit the FDA stopped most foreign and domestic inspections except for cases considered mission critical.

Class I medical device recalls are increasing across the industry said Rachna Shah of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota who studies medical device and pharmaceutical recalls.

""In general recalls are higher"" Shah said. She said one possible explanation for more serious recalls is that device companies may have become less rigorous in safety reviews for their products as the FDA was doing less monitoring.

She expects marginally higher recalls to continue through the end of next year.

But Medtronic's rate of recalls has significantly outpaced its competitors. Illinois-based Abbott has seen only one recall this year. Massachusetts-based Boston Scientific Corp. has had no recalls in 2022. Illinois-based Baxter International has had five recalls. All three of those companies have operations in Minnesota.

Medtronic with fiscal 2022 sales of $31.7 billion is the largest medical device manufacturer in the industry which puts it at higher recall risk because it simply makes more products than anyone else.

Abbott has diverse business lines; its medical device sales for 2021 were $14.4 billion. Boston Scientific posted revenue of $11.9 billion. Not counting its pharmaceutical division Baxter had $10.5 billion in medical device sales last year. Medtronic's revenue is equivalent to 86% of the combined sales of those three companies.

""The number of Class 1 recalls in recent years is atypical for us"" Medtronic's Winkels said.

Medtronic has established a central medical safety organization and added a patient safety and risk board. The board includes senior leaders from several departments — medical safety quality regulatory and legal — and provides oversight for patient safety decisions. Both were implemented in 2022.

""We have examined our end-to-end quality performance and we are focused on making sustainable improvements"" said Noel Colon Medtronic's chief quality officer. He said the company has increased oversight in such areas as risk assessment product design and integration of acquired therapies and solutions.

Medical device recalls often begin with the company which sends out alerts to doctors and patients when a problem is discovered. The FDA doesn't typically classify the severity of the recall — Class I II or III — until a few months later meaning that a recall listed on the FDA's index for 2022 may have first been launched by the company in 2021.

Unlike food and consumer product recalls a medical device recall does not necessarily mean that the product is removed from a patient and returned to the company. Recalls can often involve adjustments to device settings software updates or re-labeling a product.

In the case of any recall Medtronic undertakes a detailed investigation to resolve the issue and prevent its recurrence Winkels said.

This year's high number of recalls prompted Medtronic to implement new plans and programs that include a more rigorous review of a device's risk assessment.

Winkels said the company has ""leveraged external experts for independent perspective subject matter expertise and to supplement internal Medtronic resources.""

In September the FDA identified the company's recall of NIM endotracheal tubes as a Class I case. Medtronic reported 15 complaints two deaths and three injuries related to the device between March 31 2020 and March 31 2022.

The FDA issued a Class I recall of Cobalt Cobalt XT and Crome defibrillators in August due to the potential for delivering lower-than-necessary shocks to the patient. That issue was addressed with a software update. Medtronic reported 27 complaints and zero deaths or injuries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxhcmtpbm1vcnR1YXJ5LmNvbS9vYml0dWFyeS92aWV3L3JvYmVydC1wYXRyaWNrLW8naGFyYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Patrick O'Hara,"Robert Patrick O’Hara was born on August 1 1969 in Evanston Wyoming to Pat and Ruth Anne O’Hara and passed away peacefully in Pleasant Grove Utah on December 6 2022.

Bobby will be remembered as a man who loved his family deeply and held friends close for life. His wife Teri was the light of his life and his children Chassidy (Amanda) and Kevin (Scarlette) were his pride and joy. Throughout his life there was a loving unshakable bond between him and his parents. The family circle was completed by his cherished uncles and aunts Jerry and Joleene and Bob and Tai. Also by his cousins who were in a higher sense his sister and brothers – Diane (Jonathan) Cory (Meggin) Kelly (Brenna) Chris (Emily) and Mike (Lauren). Teri strengthened this circle by bringing to it her children Alicia and Cody along with Alicia’s children Aly Jayde Kenzie and Scarlett allowing Bobby to proudly add the title “Grandpa.”

Bobby’s family could appropriately be called a team considering the bonds that grew from decades of fishing and hunting trips family Dutch-oven cookouts in the Wind River Mountains music concerts near and far and skiing with family at Brighton and Park City. He was a life-long Dallas Cowboys fan and considered it a treasured experience to attend a game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. This was a highly adventurous soul who loved his home state of Wyoming and held close to his heart many glorious experiences at the family cabin on the Hams Fork. He was at home in the mountains behind the wheel of his jeeps and trucks.

Music was an important part of Bobby’s life both the country music he identified with and the music he played. When he held that silver Bach Stradivarius trumpet in his hands he was a force to be reckoned with. A 1987 graduate of Evanston High School his musical career started with his membership in the Davis Middle School Jazz Band that annihilated the competing bands across Wyoming Utah and Colorado. He would be appointed principal trumpet in the symphony orchestra and jazz ensembles at Interlochen as a 15-year-old. He followed with the MVP summer camp at USU and then took to the field at Rice-Eccles stadium as a high stepping member of the Ute Marching Band. He was profoundly affected by the experience of playing ‘Taps” at many burial services for veterans at the Evanston city cemetery and would take away from that experience a life-long respect for this nation its flag and our military services. Indeed it was consistent with the family’s identification with the United States Army and he proudly wore the title “Army Brat.”

Bobby was known for his strong work ethic starting out stocking shelves at the Trail Boss – the family business – and would enjoy five productive years with his own side business Rocky Mountain Log Crafters. He was as gifted with a chain saw as with the trumpet and produced some beautiful log furniture still in use in the western U.S. During this period he attended the University of Utah and Utah Valley University.

Bobby found his career calling in the medical devices industry. For five years he was employed by Boston Scientific followed by a 24-year career at Merit Medical at its South Jordan and Malvern Pennsylvania facilities culminating in his most recent position as Director Quality Assurance. He was extremely proud of his association with the Merit team and grew close to many employees over the years.

Robert Patrick O’Hara was preceded in death by his grandparents Otto and Ruth Kennedy and Geneva O’Hara his uncle Mike Jett and his cousin Kevin Bret Kennedy. He is survived by his loving wife his parents children grandchildren and his uncles aunts and cousins and their families. He leaves to everyone’s care the family dogs Miley Zoey Gracie and Lucy.

A viewing for family will be held at Larkin Sunset Gardens mortuary 1950 E. Dimple Dell Road (10600 So.) Sandy Utah at 11:00 A.M. Saturday December 17 2022. A public graveside service will follow at 12:00 Noon in the adjoining cemetery.

When Warren Buffett one of the greatest investors of all time makes a move the market listens. His company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) maintains an equities portfolio worth roughly $337 billion and investors through regulatory filings can see what stocks Berkshire is buying and selling every three months.

While Berkshire's buys often get a lot of attention investors should also keep an eye on his sales.

Berkshire selling a stock is not always indicative of that stock's performance or whether you should sell it's still something to be aware of. If you're holding a stock Berkshire is selling maybe you're missing something in your investment thesis. Here are six stocks Berkshire completely exited this year.

1. Verizon

Berkshire entered the year holding roughly 158.8 million shares of the large telecommunications company Verizon (VZ 1.53%) which were valued at close to $8.3 billion. But in the second quarter Berkshire completely closed out that position possibly because the company was repositioning for a much different economic and monetary outlook.

Berkshire may have been right to be concerned. When it released its second-quarter results Verizon also lowered its adjusted earnings guidance for the full fiscal year to a range of $5.10 to $5.25 down from $5.40 to $5.55. The company also lowered its guidance for revenue growth.

2. STORE Capital Corp

Heading into 2022 Berkshire held a little under $840 million in STORE Capital Corp (STOR) the sole real estate investment trust (REIT) in Berkshire's portfolio. As a REIT that gets special tax treatment STORE paid out at least 90% of its annual taxable income in dividends.

The company ran a triple-net lease single-tenant model in which it bought properties and then leased those properties back to the owners so the company didn't have to deal with the expenses of maintaining the property. In September the fund GIC and funds managed by Oak Street announced they would acquire STORE Capital for roughly $14 billion in cash so the stock has now really gone as far as it's going to go.

3. Abbvie

Berkshire came into the year holding about $410.7 million of the biopharmaceutical company Abbvie (ABBV 0.22%) but quickly exited the company in the first quarter of the year. It hasn't at all been a bad year for Abbvie with the stock up more than 21% and widely beating the broader market.

Abbvie reported mixed results for the third quarter with adjusted earnings beating estimates but revenue coming in less than expected. The company also confirmed the midpoint of its full-year earnings guidance range but lowered the upper bound.

4. Royalty Pharma

Berkshire sold its stake in the company Royalty Pharma (RPRX 0.43%) which totaled about $344 million at the start of 2022. Royalty Pharma funds biopharma research and development in a number of different ways and then acquires royalty interests in those companies so it's a bit like an incubator.

It's hard to see exactly what Berkshire didn't like as the stock is up more than 5% in a down year. The company's third-quarter earnings and revenue beat analyst estimates and the company raised full-year guidance. Perhaps Berkshire just didn't think the company had good long-term prospects.

5. Bristol-Myers Squibb

It was a bad year to be a pharmaceutical company in Berkshire's portfolio as the company clearly didn't like its exposure to the sector. Berkshire entered 2022 with about $324 million of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 0.45%) stock but exited its position in the first quarter of the year. This is another stock that has done quite well up more than 24% this year so it seems pretty clear that something earlier this year left Buffett and Berkshire with a bad taste in their mouths when it came to the pharmaceutical space.

6. Wells Fargo

Heading into this year it was well known that Buffett and Berkshire had had enough of the large bank Wells Fargo (WFC 1.00%). Wells Fargo found itself in the hot seat in 2016 when it came to light that bank employees had been opening credit card and bank accounts for people without their consent.

Since then the bank has faced a number of fines and punitive regulatory actions including an asset cap which prevents it from growing its balance sheet. It was also rumored that Buffett didn't like the bank's hiring of Wall Street veteran Charlie Scharf as CEO in 2019 even though Scharf appears to be doing a decent job. The sale ends more than three decades of Berkshire owning the stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFqbWMuY29tL3ZpZXcvYXN4bDEtbXV0YXRpb25zLWFzc29jaWF0ZWQtd2l0aC13b3JzZS1wcm9nbm9zaXMtaW4tbWRzLWFuZC1hbWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ASXL1 Mutations Associated With Worse Prognosis in MDS and AML,"Many studies have identified additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1) mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) but data on their potential prognostic value have not been definitive. A recent meta-analysis published in the Asia-Pacific Journal of Clinical Oncology found ASXL1 mutations to be independent risk factors for worse overall survival (OS) and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

MDS encompasses a group of hematopoietic stem cell diseases that cause peripheral cytopenia and can potentially transform into AML. ASXL1 is often found to be mutated in cases of bone marrow tumors such as MDS and AML but the role of these mutations is not clear. The goal of the meta-analysis was to examine the relationship between ASXL1 mutations and prognosis in MDS.

To study the prognostic impact of ASXL1 in patients with MDS researchers initially identified a total of 2364 studies in the PubMed Embase and Cochrane Library databases. After excluding repetitive articles review articles case reports laboratory studies meeting minutes studies that did not focus on the prognostic value of ASXL1 mutations in MDS and articles with insufficient data 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis.

Of the 10 studies reporting on ASXL1 in MDS 9 reported on multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) 3 reported on univariate HRs for OS and 2 reported on multivariate HRs for transformation to AML.

ASXL1 mutations were found to have an adverse prognostic impact on OS in patients with MDS (HR 1.68; 95% CI 1.45-1.94 P < .0001). They were also associated with AML transformation (HR 2.20; 95% CI 1.68-2.87 P < .0001). The association between mutations and OS was similar regardless of age group.

A total of 2416 studies were initially identified to explore the impact of ASXL1 mutations on AML prognosis. After a similar exclusion process 10 studies were included in the final meta-analysis of ASXL1 in AML. Of these studies 7 reported multivariable HRs for OS 4 reported univariate HRs for OS 3 provided multivariable HRs for OS when patients were aged 60 years of age or older and 3 studies provided HRs for OS of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML).

In patients with AML ASXL1 mutations were associated with poorer OS (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.20-1.56 P < .0001). In the cohort of patients aged 60 years or older the association was especially strong (HR 2.86; 95% CI 1.34-6.08; P = .006). In CN-AML there was still an association between mutations and poorer OS (HR 1.78; 95% CI 1.27-2.49; P = .001).

“The results of our meta-analysis show that patients with MDS and ASXL1 mutations had a shorter OS than those without the mutation. This result is consistent with a previous meta-analysis” the authors wrote. “… When exploring the effect of ASXL1 mutations on the prognosis of patients with AML we found that patients with AML and ASXL1 mutations had shorter OS than patients without mutations which is consistent with previous studies.”

In addition to prognostic value regarding OS the findings suggest that ASXL1 mutations in MDS also increase the likelihood of transformation to AML. Only 2 studies were included in the meta-analysis for this specific outcome but the authors conclude that the results are significant.

Taken together the meta-analysis suggests that ASXL1 mutations are independently associated with worse OS in MDS and AML as well as transformation to AML in patients with MDS. These findings could apply to prognostication for MDS and AML patients as well as help guide treatment strategies. Prospective randomized controlled trials would be beneficial to assess the impact of ASXL1 mutations in tandem with other clinical characteristics.

When her good friend and colleague Judith Shizuru MD professor of blood and marrow transplantation and cellular therapy was struggling with a difficult case Brown was always her first call.

“She would really dig into the details think outside the box and she could reach into her own understanding” Shizuru said. “She could guide you as if she was a third eye. I’ve never encountered another clinician like her. It takes insights smarts and a real sense of boldness.”

It also helped that she was fully grounded in life — whether inside the lab or clinic or at home. Weissman remembers what she did for his mother during her recovery from cancer and how she approached the life-threatening riddles facing so many others.

“She was the kind of doctor who considered the lives of others just as important as her own family” he said. “And if they’re like your family you’re not going to stop until you figure it out.”

The mom in the stands

Shizuru still doesn’t understand how Brown and Hoffman did what they did as full-time researchers and clinicians and as parents. “Two working physicians who somehow made it to every one of their kids’ events” she said. “She was the mom always in the stands the one who brought the Gatorade.”

Hoffman said his wife had a unique ability to apply multiple passions simultaneously. “From virology to immune cells to the clinical care and research — she loved them all” Hoffman said. “But most of all she loved being a mother.”

At home on bed rest during her first pregnancy Brown managed to work on her stem cell research papers. Then she homeschooled the twins until fourth grade while continuing her research.

“While she was bringing this incredibly important science to bear in my lab she was also homeschooling her twins” Weissman said. “I have no idea how she did all that — and did it so well. But that was Wes.”

She was in the stands even as the kids got older — at her son Jacob’s Stanford baseball games at the lacrosse matches of her daughter Samantha and her son Zach at every Stanford sporting event she could get to.

“She was a very enthusiastic and very loud Stanford fan” Hoffman said. Jacob was able to get the whole family field passes for last November’s Big Game against Cal — exactly the type of gathering “that made her really happy” Hoffman said.

Brown was treating patients during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic when a routine exam uncovered the cancer. She underwent surgery and numerous rounds of radiation and chemotherapy. She and Hoffman spent January through March in Boston at Brigham and Women’s Hospital hunkered down and enduring a phase 1 clinical trial.

“We researched everything we could — she wasn’t going to give up” Hoffman said. “Till the end when she would be hospitalized and she’d learn the life story of every nurse who took care of her.”

She was a unique person and her loss is so tough to grieve. It leaves a big hole.

Benedetti was a blood and marrow transplant nurse who recalls bonding with Brown over their mutual commitment to work and family. She remembers her as a selfless nurturer who always made time to listen never looking for the spotlight herself. That was saved for those closest to her. “Family was everything to her” she said. “Wes was a brilliant humble loving family-oriented person.”

Brown’s biggest disappointment was that she was too ill to return to work after the cancer diagnosis. But she wasn’t about to miss out on the landmark family moments that remained.

She was there for Samantha’s wedding in Los Gatos California in the spring and then at her PhD defense at Harvard University. Recently the whole family spent a weekend at Sierra Family Camp at Fallen Leaf Lake in the Lake Tahoe basin — a Stanford tradition they had enjoyed for years when the kids were growing up.

“That was so important to her — and she hung in there” Shizuru said. “She was a unique person and her loss is so tough to grieve. It leaves a big hole. It’s painful.”

Hoffman knows. He said he has a hard time accepting the death of his wife so early. “She was only 63 — she had so much more life to live” he said. But he draws comfort in the immense legacy she leaves behind. It’s everywhere he looks.

“She was known and loved by so many people” he said. “I never realized how many people she touched.”

Brown is survived by her husband Andy Hoffman and their children — Samantha Jacob and Zachary Hoffman.

Gifts in memory of Brown can be made at memorial.stanford.edu or by sending a check payable to Stanford University and mailed to Medical Center Development 485 Broadway University Hall 4th Floor Redwood City CA 94063. Please indicate on the online form or check that the gift is in memory of Dr. Wes Brown."

This in no way per our editorial policies influenced the final outcome of this review. It should also be noted that by clicking the buy link towards the bottom of this review our site receives a small referral payment which helps to support but not influence our editorial and other costs.

Old Forester Birthday Bourbon is a product that is well-known and beloved in the whiskey community despite the fact that so few are able to obtain a bottle — or even a taste. This vintage line is released annually in early September in an extremely limited number sometimes selling out within the day. The 2022 release had the added spin of being by sweepstakes only — no store sales.

The birthday bourbons are in celebration of George Garvin Brown founder of the original distillery (thus the “Brown” in Brown-Foreman). Brown didn’t come at the product from a spirit-loving angle but from a business one: whiskey as medicine. He was working as a pharmaceutical salesman when whiskey was still being prescribed (and often). The distillery made both Old Forester Bourbon Whisky and Early Times Kentucky Whisky.

The former followed the rules of bourbon and focused on quality to find its niche in the medical market. The brand’s namesake Dr. William Forrester (no that’s not a typo – the brand later dropped one of the “r”s) was an influence in the creation of the product searching for a more consistent product for his patients. The fact that he himself enjoyed Brown’s whiskey probably didn’t hurt.

The company was also the first to sell whiskey in the bottle rather than by the cask (or from one). An important move considering that it was easy for those selling whiskey to tamper with the product when they controlled the cask.

This became more important during Prohibition when American whiskey production was required to halt with few exceptions. Old Forester was one of only a few distilleries allowed to keep distilling in the name of creating medicine. As such Old Forester has a legacy of being the only bourbon that has been sold before during and after Prohibition by the same company.

I’ll admit that I get an excitement akin to my own birthday every time I get a taste of one of the birthday bourbons (and due to COVID it’s been quite some time). The birthday line was a standout to me in my early whiskey education and I’ve lost no enthusiasm for them since.

Tasting Notes: Old Forester 2022 Birthday Bourbon

Vital Stats: 96 proof 48% ABV aged 11 years 750ml MSRP $149.99

Appearance: A light honey tone approaching golden brown but remaining translucent. Few to no legs in sight.

Nose: Perfume-y to the point of light muskiness meets you first in a heady manner. This mellows into a light brown sugar with notes of clove and almond along the way.

Palate: Thin in texture at first but gains some chewiness over the course of a sip. A light cola flavor leads into deep vanilla as the boldest flavors. Mid-palate brings a banana flavor less like fresh fruit and more like the artificial flavoring in bubblegum (in a good way!). The finish brings in hints of latex and a touch of bitter broccoli.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vY3VybHl0YWxlcy5jb20vYmUtcmVhZHktdG8tcGF5LW1vcmUtZm9yLXlvdXItYm9vemUtYXMtYWxjb2hvbC1pbi1pbmRpYS1taWdodC1nZXQtY29zdGxpZXIv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9jdXJseXRhbGVzLmNvbS9iZS1yZWFkeS10by1wYXktbW9yZS1mb3IteW91ci1ib296ZS1hcy1hbGNvaG9sLWluLWluZGlhLW1pZ2h0LWdldC1jb3N0bGllci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Be Ready To Pay More For Your Booze As Alcohol In India Might Get Costlier,"Due to hefty taxes the alcohol industry in India is sailing on choppy waters. The AlcoBev industry in India accounts for 25% to 30% of the Indian revenue. The International Spirits & Wines Association of India (ISWAI) has warned that excessive taxes may endanger the viability of the alcoholic beverage industry. Around 67% to 80% of the prices of these products include taxes.

High Taxes Might Be A Threat To The Future Of Alcohol Industry In India: ISWAI

According to a press release Nita Kapoor CEO ISWAI said “The Indian AlcoBev industry is in deep crisis due to the inflation on one hand and high taxation on another. ” Kapoor has said that immediate action is required to correct the problem by reducing taxes or raising product prices. She added that with the threat of high taxation India might have to be ready to lose its ‘golden goose’.

Alcohol Industry Lacks Pricing Freedom

Kapoor stated further that the AlcoBev sector does not enjoy pricing freedom like other industries. She stated that industries like pharmaceuticals and automobiles increased the rates of their products. But the liquor industry doesn’t have that freedom. With no freedom to hike prices and the compulsion to pay high taxes the liquor industry might face a dire crisis.

What Is ISWAI?

The Indian AlcoBev industry ranks ninth globally with a market size of around USD 52.5 billion. It employs around 1.5 million people. ISWAI is a credible representative of the Indian Premium AlcoBev Industry with deep knowledge of governmental initiatives. Top brands in the liquor industry like Bacardi William Grant & Sons Diageo-United Spirits Beam Suntory Brown Forman and Pernod Ricard are members of ISWAI. These brands create mammoth business and employment opportunities all across the country.

While online sports betting has rapidly gained popularity in recent years the brick-and-mortar casino industry was severely impacted by COVID-19 restrictions -- and now it's being hindered by the combination of high inflation and a slowing economy.

That said according to research firm Statista the $231 billion global casino and online gambling industry will continue growing through 2024 and likely beyond. Properly positioned casino companies stand to benefit from this growth as do their investors.

Let's take a look at two major players in this space MGM Resorts International (MGM -0.69%) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR -3.00%) and weigh the question of which of these casino stocks is a better buy now.

The case for MGM Resorts International

With MGM Resorts stock down by more than 28% from its November 2021 high investors might be asking themselves if it's time to buy the dip. While the company's $3.4 billion in Q3 revenue was a quarterly record it was still unable to eke out a profit.

Room occupancy was a prime driver of that record revenue reaching 93% during the third quarter. That's the highest this metric has been since COVID-19 hit. The top-line result also came in 26% higher than the same period in 2021 and that's despite a 70% decline in revenue from MGM China due to that country's zero-COVID restrictions.

After strong back-to-back quarters CEO Bill Hornbuckle cited the attractiveness of MGM's properties both as vacation spots and as meeting places for business travelers. Convention business not only creates a considerable revenue stream for the casino operator but also helps to gauge future occupancy levels due to its far-in-advance lead times.

BetMGM the company's partner for both online and in-person sports betting also continues to make significant progress. After adding Kansas to the list of states where it was available in Q3 MGM next plans to debut it in Massachusetts Ohio and Maryland. MGM controls a 29% share of the online casino gambling market making it the leading U.S. player in this fast-growing space.

The case for Caesars Entertainment

Caesars Entertainment stock has fallen even more dramatically during the past year and now trades more than 58% below its October 2021 peak. However Caesars also posted record third-quarter results and management recently described October 2022 as the ""strongest month ever"" for its Las Vegas business.

In Q3 the casino company observed its first taste of ""normal seasonality"" since the pandemic and booked more than $1 billion in adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Occupancy in Caesars' Las Vegas segment reached 94% during the quarter and the company broke quarterly records for hotel revenue hotel profit and gaming revenue.

But while revenue soared so did utility expenses. The company normally operates at a 48% to 49% profit margin but in Q3 its profit margin only reached around 35%. A combination of high utility expenses and construction interruptions contributed to that drop in profitability.

Caesars Digital the company's digital sportsbook and online casino enjoyed a remarkable 121% revenue increase in the third quarter. While it was still unprofitable for the quarter its net loss was much smaller than last year's and reflected strong year-over-year improvement for the digital segment.

As for Q4 Caesars CEO Tom Reeg called October ""the strongest month in the history of Las Vegas for Caesars.""

How do the two companies differ?

On the surface both MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment share similar business models. Both operate a robust portfolio of casinos and resorts worldwide and both offer a digital gambling and sportsbook option. However there are subtle differences between the two. Caesars for example is known for plentiful luxury shopping options on its properties. MGM meanwhile has a better hold on the flourishing online sportsbook market.

The self-titled ""King of Sportsbooks"" MGM has emerged as a leader in this space. Considering rapid adoption and popularity of online sports betting MGM Resorts International should have a bright future taking this industry forward. Currently a more passive participant in the online sports betting revolution Caesars might not benefit as substantially.

Which stock is a better buy right now?

Based purely on revenue a stock's price-to-sales ratio can indicate whether a company is undervalued or overpriced -- the lower the ratio the better.

Metric MGM Resorts International Caesars Entertainment Market capitalization $14.0 billion $10.6 billion Price-to-sales ratio 1.11 1.00

Although Caesars Entertainment has a slightly lower price-to-sales ratio I think MGM stock makes the better buy at this point due to its leadership role in the online sportsbook game ever-present marketing efforts and significantly larger market capitalization.

However both of these casino stocks look to be gaining steam as the world wakes up from its COVID slump. Considering Caesars stock is down nearly 60% from its 2021 highs it could also represent an extremely opportunistic buying opportunity for long-term investors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYWx5d2FsYW5za3kvMjAyMi8xMi8xNy9kb21pbmlxdWUtYW5zZWwtZ29lcy1mdXR1cmlzdGljLXdpdGgtYW4tYXV0b21hdGVkLWNvb2tpZS1zaG90LXJvYm90L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dominique Ansel Goes Futuristic With An Automated Cookie Shot Robot,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.forbes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /sites/alywalansky/2022/12/17/dominique-ansel-goes-futuristic-with-an-automated-cookie-shot-robot/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024DFE15E020>, 'Connection to www.forbes.com timed out.

Each is vying for what is predicted to be a single license to open a legal casino in New York City. Technically three licenses are on offer for downstate but it is expected that two of the licenses will go to Genting Resorts World at Aqueduct and MGM-Empire City Yonkers (established successful “racinos” which will further benefit from having table games such as blackjack and paigow poker).

Mets owner Steve Cohen real-estate scion Stefan Soloviev Gristedes CEO John Catsimatidis Hudson Yards developer Stephen Ross and music mogul Jay-Z are all gunning for that license to win money.

As a source in the casino business told The Post “Every billionaire wants a casino. The epitome of success in the US is to own your own casino.”

Here are the five would-be bosses and their plans to ace out the competition:

Player: Stephen Ross

Net worth: $8.39 billion

Location: Hudson Yards which was developed by Ross through his company Related

Ross is no stranger to betting big — or losing big. In 2008 he acquired 95 percent of the Miami Dolphins for $1 billion. Last year he divorced jewelry designer Kara Ross after 18 years. A legal source told The Post that the split could have cost him as much as $300 million.

But that payout pales alongside what it will cost Ross through his Related Companies if he CEO Jeff Blau and president Bruce Beal prevail. First of all even just applying costs $1 million. If approved you have to shell out $500 million for the license.

Then there is the $700000 that Ross contributed last year to Kathy Hochul’s gubernatorial campaign which is viewed as a savvy investment.

Ross 82 has partnered with Wynn Resorts a top casino company with outposts in Las Vegas Macau and Boston. “They’ll drive the most revenue for the city” a source familiar with the project told The Post. “They’re not worried about their competitors. It’s all about what they can do versus what the competition can’t do.”

At least one of the competitors remains unruffled. “Hudson Yards has failed to live up to its potential” Stefan Soloviev told The Post. “Hudson Yards should concentrate on the promises it made for middle-income housing and green spaces instead of building a casino.”

Odds: 4–1 “If I had to have a Manhattan casino Hudson Yards is where I would want it to be” Alan Woinski president of the casino consultant Gaming USA told The Post. “And it helps that they have Wynn Resorts one of the most successful casino companies as a partner.”

Player: Stefan Soloviev

Net worth: $4.4 billion

Location: Just south of the UN — First Avenue between 38th and 40th Streets

Soloviev the son of late power-player developer Sheldon Solow is known for being tough in his business deals — and allegedly on the homefront.

Earlier this year the 47-year-old made headlines when nannies who had looked over some of his brood of 20 children — yes 20 — described Soloviev as a “time bomb” with another telling Business Insier the gig was “eight days in hell.”

Soloviev declined to talk about the allegations telling The Post: “This is a business interview.”

Acknowledging that his opponents are “smart businessmen” Soloviev said that he and his company’s CEO Michael Hershman “are smart enough to know that politics are involved but we are not going to play the political game. There have been lobbyists and [political] contributions. That happens. We hope politicians will realize our project is not just a casino.”

9 Stefan Soloviev’s bid for the license would have a casino hotel and democracy museum — as well as a London Eye-like ferris wheel — situated on six acres just south of the UN. The Soloviev Group

Soloviev told The Post that he is in talks with among others Las Vegas Sands Corp. as a potential partner. Sands owns the Venetian in Las Vegas and Macau.

He hopes to situate a casino on six blank-slate acres just south of the United Nations campus and overlooking the East River that he called “shovel ready.” He anticipates a deluxe Ferris wheel — similar to the London Eye — as well as green spaces below-ground gaming (“Casinos don’t have windows because they don’t want people to know if it is night or day”) and a museum dedicated to democracy. “With authoritarianism growing we thought it would be important” Hershman said of the museum.

“We’re not looking at a Las Vegas-type building” he added although the gambling den will include a hotel.

But one source sniped to The Post that traveling to and from the proposed casino near the UN will be nightmarish: “It will be like having the UN General Assembly 52 weeks a year.”

Odds: 1000–1 without a casino partner; 3–1 if Soloviev partners with Las Vegas Sands Corp.

“This guy has no knowledge of casinos. But if Sands gets involved I take a much closer look” said Woinski. “[Sands’] Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is the most successful casino in the world.”

Player: Steve Cohen

Net worth: $12.8 billion

Location: Citi Field home to the Mets — which Cohen bought in 2020

Hedge-fund billionaire and NY Mets owner Steve Cohen splurges. According to the book “From Scratch” Cohen once “paid Guy Fieri $100000 to be his friend for a day.” It entailed the spiky-haired chef enacting a fantasy episode of “Diners Drive-Ins and Dives” with Cohen riding shotgun. He’s amassed a $1 billion art collection and along with his wife Alexandra has made some $1.7 million in political contributions.

And then of course there is his $2.4 billion purchase of the New York Mets and the spending sprees ($102 million for closer Edwin Díaz $162 for outfielder Brandon Nimmo) that are part of Cohen’s quest to nab a World Series title by 2027.

Now teamed up with Hard Rock International — which has 14 casinos in the US Canada and Dominican Republic — Cohen hopes to strategically situate a casino in the parking lot of his team’s Citi Field near a planned $780 million NYCFC soccer stadium.

Cohen 66 has proven he can get what he wants by overcoming Bill de Blasio’s attempt to strike out his Mets deal. When the former mayor wanted the team to go to Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez he touted Cohen as a “prohibited person” due to his former hedge fund S.A.C. Capital Advisors pleading guilty to insider trading in 2013.

Meanwhile a competitor bashes Cohen for other reasons.

“You already have casinos out there at Aqueduct [eight miles away from Citi Field]” said Soloviev. “Citi Field makes no sense.”

Cohen’s representative did not return calls for comment.

Odds: 3–1 “Steve Cohen will spend more money than anyone” said Woinski. “He likes to do whatever it takes to get what he wants.”

Net worth: $4.1 billion

Location: Coney Island

A consummate New Yorker Gristedes CEO and WABC owner/talk-show host John Catsimatidis already faces competition on his turf. Also staking out Coney Island for a casino/hotel project: Thor Equities joined by Saratoga Casino Holdings the Chickasaw Nation and Legends.

Unlike Thor and company Catsimatidis approaches the billionaire casino brawl with trepidation. “We are not an official bidder at this point” Catsimatidis told The Post. “We have some interest and we are proceeding with caution.”

If the grocery billionaire takes the Coney Island plunge he may not have problems in figuring out casino security and surveillance.

Tight with private eye Bo Dietl 74-year-old Catsimatidis also knows a thing or two about facial recognition software. Not only was it briefly used to fight shoplifting at a Gristedes he also employed Clearview AI software to check up on a suitor of his daughter Andrea.

As for a casino’s prospects in the land of Nathan’s hot dogs a source brought up one major wrinkle: “How do you get 40000 people a day to Coney Island? Traffic is already crazy … and the planned ferry service from downtown and Midtown has been halted” for reasons that include shifting sand. “It would be hard for a casino to operate.”

Odds: 90–1 “[Catsimatidis] hasn’t named a casino partner and he’s running out of people” said Woinski. “I don’t think Coney Island is completely out of the question but it would not be my first choice.”

Considering all that Jay-Z has going on — including his own music career the Roc-A-Fella Records label Rocawear clothing Armand di Brignac champagne and Monogram cannabis — you’ve gotta wonder why the 53-year-old would get involved in the gambling business.

“You can have as many yachts and private jets as you like but a casino is a great inducement to do business deals over and over again” a source told The Post. “You can impress your business partners … by giving them free chips throwing private parties and putting them up in your best rooms.”

The rap mogul has partnered with real-estate firm SL Green — which claims to be NYC’s largest commercial landlord — and Caesars Entertainment which already owns or is partnered with more than 50 casinos in the US Canada and UAE.

“It is hoped that Jay … could handle residencies like the one that Adele has in Las Vegas” a source close to the project told The Post. “It would make the casino a full-on entertainment destination with a lot of New York swagger.”

Odds: 10–1 “They have a lot of opposition” said Woinski of Jay-Z and SL Green. “They have to get past the Broadway League [the trade group which includes theater owners and producers has warned a casino will be “disruptive to theater goers”].

""Our analysis has shown that the allegations made against PUMA as they were made in the 'Uyghurs for Sale' report were incorrect. Forced labor does not occur in PUMA's value chain. PUMA has no direct or indirect business relationship with manufacturers in Xinjiang the province in Western China where the Uyghurs live.

""Compliance with human rights labor rights and environmental standards is a top priority at PUMA and has been specified in our Codes of Conduct for over 20 years.""

Alstom/Bombardier (Alstom acquired Bombardier in 2021. Both companies provided a comment and were considered separate companies for counting purposes.)

Alstom: ""Following the publication of the ASPI report Alstom and ex-Bombardier Transportation (BT) have undertaken a review of potential forced labour issues in the KTK Group factories supplying Alstom and ex-BT. Based on the scope and methodology of the audit the documentation and information received from the Supplier and external audits undertaken no human rights incidents were identified at the plant that supplies Alstom.

Bombardier: ""Conducting business with integrity and the highest ethical standards is a top priority for Bombardier. Our company upholds this commitment by following a rigorous Supplier code of conduct which strictly prohibits the use of forced or compulsory labour in any of our operations or by our business partners.

The company also pointed to a previous statement.

Esquel Group

""Esquel has never and will never use forced or coerced labor. We morally oppose the use of forced labor which is completely contrary to our principles and the business practices by which we have operated for more than 40 years. We remain one of the few companies in the textile and apparel sector that is vertically integrated and able to provide our customers end-to-end traceability and extensive documentation on where they source their cotton.""

""Regarding our suppliers: We take the respect for human rights very seriously and as a general principle all Siemens suppliers must commit themselves to comply with our 'Code of Conduct' for Suppliers. This code is the basis for supplier selection and qualification. Siemens cooperates exclusively with suppliers who are committed to combating forced labor — and this applies globally. In addition the auditing of our suppliers includes the topic of 'respect of human rights' and explicitly mentions 'the prohibition of forced labor.'""

Japan Display Inc.

""After finding the report we immediately conducted a fact-finding investigation but did not find evidence that those suppliers were involved in the forced labor. Although no evidence was found at the investigation we later received a report from the primary supplier that they had terminated business with the second-tier supplier in August 2020 and the third-tier supplier in October 2020 and started using other suppliers. We have confirmed this transition of suppliers and will continue to monitor their labor practices on an ongoing basis.""



""We require compliance from all of our suppliers to the 'JDI Supply Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook' and require them to audit and report their CSR compliance via the JDI

Suppliers CSR Self-Audit Checklist.

""Also in the JDI standard procurement contract we prohibit all suppliers from using forced labor and also require the entire supply chain including the second- and third-tier suppliers and contractors to the suppliers to comply with JDI's CSR principles and confirm the status of this compliance. We will continue to respect human rights and take a strong stand against forced labor.""

View the current offers here.

There is a wide range of hotel options in the Wyndham Rewards program — from budget-friendly hotels like Days Inn and Super 8 through Ramada and Tryp to upscale brands like Wyndham Grand and Registry Collection Hotels. That includes Caesars Rewards locations as well thanks to its partnership with Wyndham.

With so many options to choose from which credit card should you use to pay for a Wyndham Rewards hotel: a Wyndham Rewards card or something else? Here's a closer look.

Comparing credit cards for a Wyndham hotel stay

Aside from using a Wyndham cobranded credit card you might also consider using a good travel rewards card that earns transferable points. Let's look at some common options and what you could get when using these cards.

* Bonus value is an estimated value calculated by TPG and not the card issuer.

The information for the Wyndham Earner Business Wyndham Earner American Express Green and Wyndham Earner Plus cards has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Which card should you use?

In many of life's choices you can't have everything you want at the same time. However with Wyndham hotel stays that's not necessarily true. The most important benefits given to you by having a Wyndham credit card don't require you to actually pay with that credit card to receive the perk.

Related: Which Wyndham Rewards credit card is right for you?

For example if you hold the Wyndham Earner Plus card you'll enjoy benefits like late checkout and room upgrades regardless of what credit card you pay with during your stay. Interestingly this even applies to the ""cardmember discounted rate"" for saving money on hotel bookings. The terms and conditions of this benefit don't require you to pay with a Wyndham card to unlock the cardmember discounted rates. You can enjoy this benefit as long as you are logged in to your associated account when booking online or by providing your account number if booking over the phone.

You'll also enjoy other benefits with Wyndham Rewards regardless of which card you use to settle your final bill. This includes earning bonus points associated with your elite status tier. Members earn 10 points per dollar and elite members can earn 10% 15% or 20% extra points depending on their status. This isn't contingent on paying with a Wyndham credit card. You also don't need to pay with a Wyndham credit card to take advantage of the reduced rate on Go Free (free night awards) redemptions; this benefit allows cardholders to use 10% fewer points on award stays.

Furthermore you can enjoy a unique benefit of Wyndham Rewards: rollover nights. Here's how this works: You need nine nights per year to qualify for Platinum status and 24 nights to qualify for Diamond. If you stay 15 nights with Wyndham this year you have six nights more than you needed for Platinum but not enough to reach Diamond status. Those extra nights will roll over into next year to give you a head start. And this benefit is available regardless of how you pay for your stays throughout the year.

Since these benefits will apply regardless of how you pay the question becomes what type of points and how many of them you want to earn.

Do you want to earn an 8.8% return on spending (according to TPG's valuations) but have points that can only be used in one way (i.e. with Wyndham Rewards)? This is your path if you pay with the Wyndham Earner Business card. Or would you prefer to earn a 5.4% return on spending with the Citi Premier Card (see rates and fees) and have options for how to use your points including transferring them to Wyndham for hotel redemptions?

It's also worth pointing out that you can earn more rewards by booking through the Chase portal or Capital One portal. However you will likely forgo your status perks and benefits since these are considered third-party bookings.

Bottom line

There are many hotel credit cards and numerous other travel rewards credit cards that you could use to pay for an upcoming hotel stay at a Wyndham property. Whether you're staying at the most expensive or most affordable hotel in the Wyndham Rewards program the way you earn points and the perks available to you won't change. Thus the decision hinges on the type of points you want to earn — Wyndham Rewards points or transferable points — and the value you assign to them.

As I’ve made my way through it now at a country count of 141 I’ve seen that media reports are often misleading cities are not what they may seem to outsiders and some of the most joyous moments of my travel have been in the places I have been warned to stay away from. That said there is one place that I strongly hesitate to visit right now…and yet I wonder if I am guilty of the same fear-mongering.

The One Country I’m Too Afraid To Travel To: Haiti

I remember when I took my family to Israel a couple years ago many well-intentioned readers urged me not to go. I was told that it was too dangerous and that Jerusalem was bad enough but if I took my family into the West Bank I was really showing a disregard for their safety and well-being.

While I did not simply dismiss such warnings we went anyway and had a remarkable trip. We also felt quite safe in both Jerusalem and in Bethlehem.

Years earlier I decided to spend a weekend in…Iraq. The war was still waging but things were calm in Erbil the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan in northern Iraq. I had a wonderful time and never felt like I was in danger. In fact I even walked from the walled city to the airport at night by myself.

People warned me not to travel to Iran Saudi Arabia Cuba and Afghanistan and I did anyway. In Afghanistan I even hired a security detail (driver guide and armed guard) that accompanied me everywhere but in retrospect that probably was not necessary.

The last time I wrote about this topic (over a decade ago!) I said that I would not visit Venezuela. At the time I felt that there was too much risk for U.S. citizens. Ten years later the situation has not improved and there is still some angst that an airport agent would drop some drugs in my bag or something nefarious like that…but I would go to Venezuela in a heartbeat. My friend was in Caracas recently and had a lovely visit. Yes times are tough in Venezuela but you can enjoy a visit there and need not fear for your safety.

I’ve been hesitant to go to Somalia but despite the elevated danger I am planning a trip there next year and want to have a coffee at Beydan in Mogadishu. I’m also ready to travel to Yemen despite the never-ending civil war there. I am also open to Sudan.

But whether rational or not there is one place I cannot seem to stomach even considering: Haiti. Last week I was talking to a pastor that used to do missions work there. It’s so dangerous right now. Of course I have been reading reports in the news as well about the armed gangs running Port au Prince. And then this morning this headline from the UK Daily Mail:

I don’t get (all) my news from a British tabloid but this report merely confirms what I have been hearing over and over again.

And yet American Airlines still flys to Haiti each day. Can it really be a total failed state if American Airlines is still sending crews there?

CONCLUSION

I want to visit every country in the world. Over time some doors open and others close. Syria for example has returned to a degree of stability not seen in years and I would feel very comfortable going now and even taking my family with me. Haiti on the hand seems to me to be the definition of a failed state. But while it seems too dangerous to brave right now I wonder if this (like Israel Venezuela Iraq and others) is just media sensationalism rather than an accurate reflection of what is really going on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbm92YWNhcHNmYW5zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzE3L2EtZ29hbC1mb3ItZ3VzLWVyaWstZ3VzdGFmc3Nvbi1zY29yZXMtZmlyc3QtZ29hbC1hcy1hLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tY2FwaXRhbC_SAXFodHRwczovL25vdmFjYXBzZmFucy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8xNy9hLWdvYWwtZm9yLWd1cy1lcmlrLWd1c3RhZnNzb24tc2NvcmVzLWZpcnN0LWdvYWwtYXMtYS13YXNoaW5ndG9uLWNhcGl0YWwvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Goal For Gus: Erik Gustafsson Scores First Goal As A Washington Capital,"Screenshot: NBC Sports Washington

Washington Capitals defenseman Erik Gustafsson scored his first goal of the 2022-23 regular season on Saturday night against the Toronto Maple Leafs and former Caps goaltender Ilya Samsonov in his 32nd game of the campaign.

Gustafsson notched his first lit lamp at the 11:12 mark of the first period at Capital One Arena on assists from Sonny Milano and John Carlson.

The goal marks Gustafsson’s first as a member of the Capitals who signed him to a one-year contract in free agency this past summer to bolster their defensive corps. The 30-year old blueliner has now recorded a goal and 10 assists on the 2022-23 season coming into the night’s game averaging 19:11 of ice time a night for Head Coach Peter Laviolette.

The multitalented Jaden Lucas Miller an accomplished sprinter in the track circuit and burgeoning actor is not staying in one lane.

The 17-year-old Miller will play a key role in a feature film ""Not Another Church Movie"" directed by James Michael Cummings and Johnny Mack. During filming Miller found himself beside household names like Mickey Rourke Tisha Campbell Vivica A. Fox Kyla Pratt and Kevin Daniels for the role.

""Some people were amazed...even the teachers are like 'you're in a movie dude'"" he said of the reception at Cardinal Gibbons High School where he's a junior.

Miller has dabbled in modeling dancing and theater. Over the last two years he's come into his own enough to grow confident in his acting ability.

""I had an entertainment personality but I was shy"" Miller said. ""As I'm getting older I'm starting to break out of my shell more and more.""

Miller said he didn't expect to win the part but got a couple hints from the staff that he was a top candidate after auditioning. He auditioned for roles with big productions like Space Jam: A New Legacy and Till but was not selected.

Eventually a thrilling phone call changed everything.

""My agent called me and said 'well hello Michael Jr'"" he said.

In the movie Miller plays the role of Michael Jr. a devoted basketball player with NBA dreams scraping by with his mother in a less fortunate home life while battling teenage temptations.

""I can relate to him"" Miller said. ""He wants to come back and help his mother.""

Cardinal Gibbons High student Jaden Miller poses with actress and singer Tisha Campbell.

Miller got the chance to brush elbows with the stars like Pratt and Williams while filming in Savannah Georgia. He said they inspired him with positive reinforcement and uplifting messages.

""When I met Kyla I thought she was going be all bougie"" Miller said. ""She came up to hug me.""

Because of his athleticism Miller said he didn't have to work on his basketball skills too much for the role. In Raleigh he shows off his speed competing in the 400 and 800-meter dashes on the Crusaders' track squad. He's won the conference in the 400 and has broken the 50-second mark in the event. He might get some of that skill from his mother Georgia Miller who ran track herself at St. Augustine's University.

In 2020 he was in a commercial for NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson and has done voiceover work.

Getting lost in a role and evolving a character is the appeal for Jaden who hopes to major in psychology when he graduates high school. His mother said he's an A-B student.

""I like the psychological part of it"" Miller said of acting. ""You're developing a character and enhancing their objectives and knowing their arc to be able to see it on screen it's just magical.""

The movie is slated for a spring release.

By Salvatore Cernuzio

At the beginning of his pontificate in 2013 when Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone was still Secretary of State Pope Francis handed in a resignation letter ""in case of impediment due to health reasons."" Revealing this decision which Pope Paul VI had also taken during his time Pope Francis spoke about this matter in a wide-ranging interview granted to the Spanish daily ABC. The full interview appeared on Sunday with previews posted a day earlier.

The Pope met with the newspaper's editor Julián Quirós and its Vatican correspondent Javier Martínez-Brocal when he addressed numerous topics on current events regarding the life of the Church and the world.

The conversations touched on the war in Ukraine where the Pope said he does not see ""a short-term end to it since it is a world war"" the cases of abuse by clergy the role of women in the Roman Curia (where he says ""within two years a woman will head a Dicastery"") Benedict XVI's 2013 resignation and his own possible resignation.



Resignation letter



The Pope spoke about the existence of his letter of resignation saying ""I have already signed my resignation. It was when Tarcisio Bertone was Secretary of State. I signed the resignation and told him: 'In case of a health impediment or whatever here is my resignation. You have it'. I don't know who Cardinal Bertone gave it to but I gave it to him when he was Secretary of State."" The two ABC interviewers asked if the Pope wished this to be known and the Pope said ""that's why I'm telling you"" recalling that Paul VI had also left his resignation in writing in the event of health issues and Pius XII had probably done so as well. ""This is the first time I am saying this"" the Pope adds. ""Now maybe someone will go and ask Cardinal Bertone to 'give me that letter' (the Pope said jokingly)... surely (Cardinal Bertone) will have given it to the new Secretary of State.""

War in Ukraine



The interview also focuses on the ongoing war in Ukraine against which the Pope has spoken out more than a hundred times. He also states bluntly: ""What is happening in Ukraine is terrifying. There is enormous cruelty. It is very serious...""

The Pope sees no short-term end to the war on the horizon: ""This is a world war. Let us not forget that. There are already several hands involved in the war. It is global. I think a war is fought when an empire starts to weaken and when there are weapons to use to sell and to test. It seems to me that there are many interests involved."" The Pope has spoken out against the war more than a hundred times saying ""I do what I can. They don't listen"" adding ""What is happening in Ukraine is terrifying. There is enormous cruelty. It is very serious. And this is what I decry continuously."" The Pope confirms his openness in receiving and listening to everyone: ""Now Volodymir Zelensky has sent me one of his religious advisors for the third time. I am in contact I receive people I help...""

Vatican diplomacy

Pope Francis own outreach goes hand in hand with the Holy See's diplomatic efforts. On this topic the ABC interviewers asked why the Vatican is so cautious in speaking out against totalitarian regimes. ""The Holy See always tries to safeguard peoples...through dialogue and diplomacy"" Pope Francis replies. ""The Holy See never goes it alone...It always tries to safeguard diplomatic relations and to save what can be saved with patience and dialogue.""

Abuse cases



Answering a question on the cases of sexual abuse by the clergy the Pope says ""it is very painful very painful"" when referring to his meetings with victims that have taken place during his pontificate. ""These are people who have been destroyed by those who should have helped them mature and grow up. This is very difficult. Even if there were only one case it is horrendous and that a person who should lead you to God destroys you on this path.""

Role of women



The ABC interview then focuses on topics of a more 'ecclesial' nature starting with possible leadership roles for women in the Roman Curia. ""There will be"" Francis says assuredly. ""I have someone in mind for a Dicastery where a position will be available in two years. There is no obstacle to a woman leading a Dicastery where a lay person can be prefect. If it is a Dicastery of a sacramental nature it must be presided over by a priest or a bishop"" the Pope explained.

Future Conclaves



The Pope then addressed the debate over how the work of future Conclaves could be made difficult given that the new cardinals he has created do not know each other well and come from different and distant places. The Pope said it is true that there could be issues ""from the human point of view"" but ""it is the Holy Spirit who is at work in the conclave."" The Pope then recalled a proposal of a German cardinal during the August meetings on Praedicate Evangelium ""that in the election of a new Pope only cardinals living in Rome should participate"". The Pope then asked rhetorically ""is this the universality of the Church?""

Benedict XVI: a saint a great man

Speaking on the relationship with his predecessor Benedict XVI Pope Francis described him as ""a saint"" and ""a man of great spiritual life"" revealing that he visits with him often and always feels ""edified"" by his transparent gaze. ""He has a good sense of humour he is lucid very alive he speaks softly but follows the conversation. I admire his lucidity. He is a great man'. Pope Francis on the other hand says he has no intention of defining the juridical status of Pope emeritus: ""I have the feeling that the Holy Spirit does not have interest that I deal with these matters.""

Church in Germany



Regarding the Church in Germany grappling with the synodal process that has generated and still generates various reactions even negative ones Pope Francis recalls the ""very clear"" letter he wrote in June 2019: ""I wrote it on my own. It took me a month. It was a letter as if to say: 'Brothers reflect on this'.

Visit to Marseilles



During the interview conversations the Pope mentioned that he has a journey planned to Marseilles for the 'Mediterranean Encounter' noting that it is not a trip to France per se and that the priority for his apostolic journeys has been to visit the smaller countries of Europe.

Asked about the issue of Catalonia the Pope said that ""each country must find its own historical path to solve these problems. There is no single solution."" He then cites the case of North Macedonia or South Tyrol in Italy with its own status. As for the role that the Church should maintain in this matter he emphasises instead: 'What the Church cannot do is to be a propaganda voice for one side or the other but yes to accompany the people so that they can find a definitive solution."" In the same vein the Pope recalls that: ""When a priest meddles in politics it is not good.... The priest is a pastor. He must help people to make good choices. Accompany them. But not to be a politician. If you want to be a politician leave the priesthood and become a politician.""

Motu Proprio on Opus Dei



In conclusion when asked about last July's Motu Proprio Ad Charisma tuendum on Opus Dei the Pope said that the document addressed an area that needed to be redefined and resolved. It was not a disciplinary measure or takeover as some have claimed. ""Please. I am a great friend of Opus Dei I love the people of Opus Dei very much and they work well in the Church. The good they do is very great.""

Francis told the Spanish newspaper ABC he had “already signed my renunciation” when asked in an interview what would happen if health issues or an accident left a pope unable to carry out his duties.

“I signed it and said: ‘If I should become impaired for medical reasons or whatever here is my resignation. Here you have it”’ he told ABC.

Francis who had bowel surgery in 2021 and has been affected by knee pain that for months forced him use a wheelchair said he had given the note to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone who then was the Vatican secretary of state.

“In practice there is already a rule” he said.

The pontiff who turned 86 on Saturday quipped that now that he had revealed the existence of his resignation note “someone will run up to Bertone [saying] ‘Give me that piece of paper.’” He added he was sure Bertone would have passed on the letter to the current secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin.

In past remarks Francis has hailed the decision of his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI to resign because he felt due to advancing age he would not be best able to carry out his duties. Benedict who is living in a monastery on the Vatican’s grounds was the first pontiff to resign in 600 years and his stepping down paved the way for Francis’s election as the first pope from South America.

Francis in the interview played down his mobility issues saying: “One governs with the head not the knee.” He has increasingly used a cane instead of a wheelchair to get around in public.

Catholic church law requires a papal resignation be “freely and properly manifested” – as was the case when Benedict startled the world when he announced his resignation to a gathering of prelates at the Vatican in February 2013."

The carnival held every September by the Billings Education Foundation to benefit the public school system raised $62000 for participating school groups. By comparison only $2100 total was raised by school groups in 2020-21 combined after the COVID-19 pandemic canceled the carnival in favor a fun run. $43000 was raised in 2019 when the carnival was forced inside Skyview High School due to a winter storm.

2022's revenue almost matched the $64000 raised during the last outdoor carnival in 2018.

""It is the biggest fundraiser of the year"" said Skyview senior Jessica Walks.

Walks and the rest of her Business Professionals of America club members remember it well after they set up four different booths to raise money.

""I did a soccer kick"" said fellow senior Jacob Hanson. ""We set up a goal and gave kids candy if they made it in. (Jessica) did facepainting - bless her for doing that.""

""We had an endless line. Everybody wanted their faces painted"" Walks said. ""My favorite design was definitely the Minnie Mouse. It was a little bow on the forehead and some whiskers. It was the easiest one and the most fun for me.""

It’s a blend of fun and future for Walks who used the Saturday Live booth as business training.

""They're my favorite classes I've taken at Skyview"" she said. ""It showed me that I want to be in a business field in the future and what I'm going to major in so it's been a lot of fun for me.”

""We approached it as a business"" Hanson said. ""We tried to make it fun for the kids but the bottom line was trying to build funds.""

Skyview BPA estimated that they raised several thousand dollars during Saturday Live. It helped pay for Hanson Walks and others to go to regional and national conferences but more importantly it felt like normal again.

""I always enjoyed Saturday Live when I was a kid"" Walks said ""so it was great to experience working it because I remember when I was in their place.""

NEW ORLEANS — The United States Library of Congress has announced the addition of a short film entitled Mardi Gras Carnival to the National Film Registry.

Mardi Gras Carnival is an 1898 film of the Krewe of Rex rolling through New Orleans.

Earlier this year the Eye Filmmuseum in Amsterdam discovered the oldest surviving film of the parade in its collection following a previous request from the Louisiana State Museum.

Mardi Gras Carnival includes part of Rex rolling and shows the floats and riders. This edition of Rex also included a live bull. The theme of Rex that year was ""Harvest Queens.""

The film became the focus of attention thanks to its inclusion in the Rex: The 150th Anniversary of the School of Design exhibition curated by the Louisiana State Museum in New Orleans.

“As we gear up for the kickoff of carnival season in Louisiana which starts with Twelfth Night on January 6 this film takes us back in time to show us what Mardi Gras parades were like almost 125 years ago. While there are many traditions in the city that are the backbone of the annual celebration the image of Rex parading through the streets of New Orleans is known worldwide. Now thanks in part to the Louisiana State Museum this rare footage is preserved for many generations to come” said Lieutenant Governor Billy Nungesser.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50ZnJlYWtpbnJvYm90LmNvbS90ZWNoL3NlZS1jYXJuaXZhbC1yaWRlLWJyZWFrLWFjY2lkZW50Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,See A Carnival Ride Break Mid-Air Sending Riders Crashing Into Metal Pole,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.giantfreakinrobot.com', port=443): Read timed out.

According to AAA the average price per gallon for diesel on Friday in the U.S. was $4.80 down nearly 20 cents from a week prior and down 55 cents from last month’s average.

A drop in Brent crude oil prices decreases in wholesale and retail margins along with increased refinery output continues to chip away at historically high prices.

Tom Kloza head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service expects the downward trend to continue particularly in the spring following a rough year of high prices.

“Diesel prices have some upcoming anniversaries that are quite staggering” Kloza said. “In 2022 January was ushered in with street prices around $3.63 per gallon and February saw a $3.89/gal average. Post Ukraine invasion we saw sequential prices (March through December) of $5.08/gal; $5.52/gal; $5.74/gal; $5.55/gal; $5.08/gal; $4.98/gal; $5.17/gal; $5.31/gal and $4.99/gal (December so far).

U.S. Energy Information Administration



“I expect that diesel is quite expensive on a year-on-year basis in January and February but prices in most other months should be $1/gal or more beneath the numbers endured in this wild 2022” Kloza continued.

Patrick De Haan head of petroleum analysis at Gas Buddy expects “a noticeable improvement in supply and high refinery runs” to continue to bring down diesel prices.

“For now I think there's plenty of room for diesel prices to keep declining. How long that extends into 2023 is a bit uncertain but for now I'd say there's a drop of roughly 40 to 80 cents per gallon still coming” De Haan said.

In its latest short-term energy outlook issued last week the U.S. Energy Information Administration changed its forecast from November with “Brent crude oil price forecast averaging $92 per barrel in 2023 $3/barrel less than we had forecast last month.”

The report goes on to say that “a slight contraction in the U.S. economy and refinery maximization of distillate fuel production will reduce distillate prices” in the first half of 2023. EIA expects U.S. diesel refining margins to fall by 19% in 2023 compared with 2022.

Kloza also sees diesel margins dropping in 2023.

“Right now we find street prices for diesel at extremely hefty margins to wholesale costs but those should come down to where diesel largely moves for less than $4.25/gal at retail with considerably lower numbers available to fleets that buy on cost-plus basis” Kloza said.

If you’ve played Mario Kart 8 Deluxe online you’ve likely come across a lot of players using Waluigi with the Wild Wiggler Rollers and Paper Glider. Although part of the reason for this might be the humorous contrast of watching Waluigi ride on a caterpillar the main factor behind this build’s ubiquity is that it is one of the most optimal character and kart combinations in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. This naturally leads into the question of why this build is so good and if there are other builds in the game that might be able to compete with it. This guide will aim to answer both of those questions first by explaining some of the hidden mechanics that make certain builds more viable than others and then by providing examples of some of the more competitive builds Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has to offer.

When it comes to the best character kart builds and setup in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe first and foremost it should be made clear that while the character and kart used certainly have an impact on a player’s performance individual player skill is by far the most important factor in winning races. A competitive player can beat an average one even while using the worst possible character and kart while an inexperienced player will still struggle against a more skilled opponent even with an optimal setup. This is just to say that if there is a particular character or kart you enjoy using it’s absolutely possible to compete with it in all but the most competitive scenarios.

That being said stats do have an impact and it’s time to get into what that impact is. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe sadly leaves out a fair amount of information related to the stats assigned to gear. For starters individual characters have specific stats themselves despite these not being shown in-game. This is why you’ll often see a bevy of Waluigi players online as he is one of the characters with the most ideal stat spread relative to the builds we want.

Speaking of stats what exactly are they? Well the game offers five different stats for players to customize these being Speed Acceleration Weight Handling and Traction. However the game actually accounts for a total of fourteen different hidden stats which are the true determining factors in a build’s performance. These are Weight Acceleration On-Road Traction Off-Road Traction Mini-Turbo Invincibility and Ground Water Air and Anti-gravity variants for Speed and Handling. This may seem like a lot to consider but in reality there are only two important stats here in determining a build’s effectiveness: Ground Speed and Mini-Turbo.

Ground Speed is straightforward it’s simply the maximum potential speed of the vehicle while on the ground. Given that most races will take place almost entirely driving on the ground wanting to optimize this value makes a lot of sense. Mini-Turbo is a bit more interesting; it affects Mini-Turbo boosts the small boost in speed obtained after drifting shown by the presence of blue yellow or purple sparks. The Mini-Turbo stat affects the charging speed and duration of Mini-Turbo boosts; in essence the higher the stat the faster and longer your Mini-Turbo boosts will be. This is a crucial stat to be focusing on as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe places huge emphasis on Mini-Turbos with these arguably being the most important technique in the game when it comes to building up and maintaining speed.

With that out of the way the character and kart setups we are going to look at for our Mario Kart 8 Deluxe guide are all ones that focus on these two attributes Ground Speed and Mini-Turbo. However a balance needs to be struck between the two as it’s impossible for any one kart to max out both of these stats. As such three builds will be offered below; one which tries to maintain a comfortable balance between both stats one which prioritizes Mini-Turbo and a final one which prioritizes Ground Speed.

Balanced Build

Waluigi/Wild Wiggler/Roller/Paper Glider

Note: Several characters and kart elements actually share stats with others; for instance Waluigi is interchangeable with Roy or Donkey Kong Roller wheels can be swapped with the Azure Rollers and the Paper Glider can be exchanged for the Parachute Cloud Glider or Flower Glider.

The most common kart setup seen online this build strikes a very nice balance between Ground Speed and Mini-Turbo making it a comfortable choice for any track on any speed. This build also possesses a decent amount of Weight letting it push lighter karts out of the way while not being completely knocked aside by heavier karts. As mentioned above several elements of this build can actually be swapped out for others but this is the most common setup for visibility and hitbox reasons (hitboxes do vary between characters and karts but differences are typically negligible).

However I do want to offer a similar equally viable build which can be made by swapping out the Wild Wiggler for the Biddybuggy or Mr. Scooty (both of those vehicles share the same stats). While a little bit of Ground Speed and Weight will be lost this kart combination offers higher Mini-Turbo and Acceleration as well as a little bit more Handling. This makes the build a little bit more Mini-Turbo-friendly while maintaining most of the qualities of the previous one making it another very solid competitive option.

Mini-Turbo Build

Baby Peach/Biddybuggy/Roller/Paper Glider

Note: Baby Peach can be swapped for Baby Daisy Biddybuggy for Mr. Scooty Roller for Azure Roller and Paper Glider for Parachute/Cloud Glider/Flower Glider.

This is one of the best character builds and setups in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe thanks to the highest possible Mini-Turbo stat and as such excels on curve-heavy tracks that encourage heavy amounts of drifting such as Yoshi Circuit or Cheese Land. Although this build might not perform as well as the balanced one on every track it still works very well on most of them and can pull ahead of its competition through the speed and frequency of its Mini-Turbos.

One other factor to consider is that this build has a lot of Acceleration a by-product of its focus on the Mini-Turbo stat. The main reason that this is important is that higher Acceleration makes it easier to return to top speed after getting hit which can be incredibly important in races where you are constantly getting pelted with various items. This lends the build a slight edge in hectic scenarios over the Balanced or Ground Speed-focused ones.

Ground Speed Build

Wario/Sneeker/Slim/Hylian Kite

Note: Wario can be swapped for Dry Bowser Sneeker for Gold Standard/Master Cycle Slim for Wooden/Crimson Slim and Hylian Kite for Super Glider/Waddle Wing.

On the other end of the spectrum this is a more niche build that focuses heavily on Ground Speed. Do note that this build still tries to maintain a little bit of Mini-Turbo stat in spite of this different focus since Mini-Turbos are still a valuable tool and no course is going to be completely devoid of turns you’ll have to drift around. Regardless this build will perform best on tracks with a limited amount of Mini-Turbo opportunities such as Toad Circuit or Wario’s Gold Mine so that the kart can take full advantage of its high maximum Ground Speed.

Of note although the Master Cycle has the same stats as the Sneeker it is one of the few bikes in the game with an inside drift pattern. While still viable these bikes tend to be more difficult to use because the lines they take while drifting don’t align very well with the turns of most tracks. As such there are only a handful of courses (such as Toad’s Turnpike) where these bikes are able to take full advantage of their unique drifting quirk.

And those are some of the best characters karts builds and setups in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe! To be clear determining a single best character/kart combination in this game is difficult since every build will end up with benefits and drawbacks or might simply not align with how everyone wants to play the game. For instance if playing on 200cc you might want to replace the Balanced build’s Waluigi with Link or Yoshi to improve Handling and help prevent yourself from veering off-track due to the increased speed. Or for mostly water-based stages like Dolphin Shoals you might want to consider using the Streetle which boasts a surprisingly high Water Speed stat. As such while the builds suggested here are competitively viable baselines players do have the freedom of experimenting with different setups without a tremendous loss in performance. If players do find themselves wanting to experiment with other builds there are many online resources that can help with that such as this very helpful Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Builder website which will also show every character and kart element’s hidden stats.

Company rule resulted in the loss of courtly patronage for artists in India which led to artists and craftsmen from the courtly centres in Bengal migrating to cities such as Patna and Murshidabad which had viable commercial markets. Indian artists who had been trained in the conventions of Western art such as perspective chiaroscuro and the picturesque were absorbed in the administrative apparatus of the East India Company and employed to create an ethnographic record of the people landscape culture and traditions of India including costumes professions architecture and street scenes. There were also a number of artists who came from Europe particularly Britain.

A school of painting that emerged in the Indian subcontinent during the late eighteenth century Company painting was a hybrid style that was influenced by European painting styles as well as existing painting traditions in India bringing together the visual idioms of Mughal and Rajput miniature painting with Western modes such as Victorian Illusionism and the picturesque. Other influences included prints from Europe as well as the works of landscape painters such as Thomas and William Daniell. Notable artists of the Company painting school included Sewak Ram of Patna and Ghulam Ali Khan of Delhi.

Sustained by the East India Company and its officials such as William Fraser and James Skinner the Company School had several centres across the subcontinent with the work influenced by the local subject matter and pre-existing styles. Commonly commissioned subjects included depictions of flora and fauna personal collections of animals estates monumental architecture banquets and parties servants carriages and horses.

Beyond commissions the artists also began producing standard sets of paintings. Instead of the traditional gouache the paintings were characteristically made in watercolour and were distinct in their treatment of linear perspective and shading. They were rendered on paper occasionally on ivory and bound as folios in albums. Even as it spread over the subcontinent the Company Painting style remained concentrated in centres of British influence such as Delhi Lucknow Varanasi Kolkata Murshidabad Patna Thanjavur and Tiruchirapalli. It lasted through the nineteenth century also spreading to colonial centres in Myanmar Nepal and Sri Lanka until being replaced by the medium of photography.

A large number of Company paintings were entrusted to the East India Company’s Museum as gifts from Company officials. After its closure the collection was transferred to the Victoria and Albert Museum London which along with the British Library contains the largest body of Company paintings.

By Nadia Fazlulhaq

In the rural Horiwila area in Palugaswewa in the Anuradhapura District corn farmers are once again facing a fall armyworm infestation.

They lament that more than 1500 acres of corn cultivation have been attacked by the fall armyworm (locally called sena dalambuwa). Government officials are yet to visit the sites and provide support they say.

Farmers complain that pesticides are not effective and they are trying their best to stop the pest from spreading further.

Corn farmer Wasantha Ajith Kumara said: “The money and sweat we invested are being destroyed in front of our eyes. Most farmers have sold their paddy stocks and pawned their jewellery for this cultivation.’’

Another farmer Kasun Bandara said that when the caterpillars destroyed the crop in 2018 the Government assured them of compensation but they had not received any money.

The fall armyworm was first detected in the country in 2018 and more than 40000 hectares were destroyed by the pest mainly in the Anuradhapura Badulla Ampara and Monaragala districts.

Despite inviting Rwandan agriculture experts to tackle the menace corn cultivation is once again under attack.

The Agriculture Department’s former director general Dr. W.M.W. Weerakoon said the poultry industry depends heavily on local corn. “For both chicken and cattle feed the country needs 552000 metric tonnes of corn. A small amount goes for the production of Thriposha as well.’’

The Agriculture Ministry’s forecast for 2023 is 574985 MT from 148575 hectares.

Dr. Weerakoon said the department wants farmers to use biological or low toxicity methods.

“The Rwandan agriculture experts wanted us to use highly toxic pesticides which we refused. Agricultural officers should always be on alert to inform farmers before it spreads rapidly” he said.

The fall armyworm which attacks corn fields has been seen in rice-producing countries in

Asia as well.

K.G. Premathilake professor in weed science at the Department of Export Agriculture at Uva-Wellassa University said: “One plant can have about 150-200 caterpillars. Due to the pesticide and herbicide ban corn production was affected. If this is not controlled corn production will drop”

he said.

Prof. Premathilake said laboratory tests about controlling the fall armyworm using margosa and ginger have been successful. The Agriculture Ministry has been notified. “For now there is no direct threat to paddy cultivation. But there is always a risk with pests like this.’’

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera told the Sunday Times he asked a team from the Agriculture Department in Peradeniya to visit the areas assess the situation and provide solutions to corn farmers. He said officials were told to prevent the spread of the pest.

We didn’t need World Population Review to tell us that Westchester is one of the richest communities in the U.S. Yet as of this year that same demographics research company placed nine Westchester County towns among the top 100 richest towns in America — more than any other county in the U.S. With all that accumulated wealth it follows that Westchester would attract some of the most experienced and talented wealth advisors to be found anywhere. But isolating the best of the best is no mean feat so WM hired data-research company DataJoe to conduct an exhaustive multitiered survey to determine and document the county’s top 314 wealth managers.

(Image credit: David Bloom)

And boy is there ever something to ponder for the cable TV business: Will 2023 be the year the industry finally decides that providing cable TV is something someone else should worry about?

The coming year may be the first where a major cable TV provider stops selling um cable TV. Most such companies have been evolving away from the original basis of their business for years especially by selling the fastest and highest-bandwidth broadband out there for home and business use.

But should a major provider like Comcast or Charter take the step of dropping cable TV it would be a landmark in the industry’s history and almost certainly won’t be the only such decision to come. And that has implications for the broadcast and basic-cable networks that will lose a source of revenue and reach even as they navigate a difficult transition to streaming.

We’re already seeing hints that to paraphrase one of the industry’s biggest-ever hits Cable Winter Is Coming.

Comcast the nation’s biggest cable company reported that it had lost nearly 10% of its cable TV customers over the past year. The company has had more broadband than cable subscribers for years but that’s only accelerating. In Q3 the company said it had signed up a record number of broadband customers.

Comcast has committed to spend more than $200 for each passing in its footprint to upgrade its network to multi-gigabit speeds by 2025.

Comcast which more than most providers made early and active peace with the Netflixes of the world is probably the least likely candidate to drop cable TV anytime soon though. Its entertainment holdings include NBC CNBC MSNBC and a batch of other basic-cable networks. Its vertically integrated approach is a key tenet of Brian Roberts’s pitch to investors.

In fact if I’m making 2023 predictions for Comcast Roberts is more likely to double down on that content-pipe twin play perhaps finally persuading Shari Redstone to sell all or parts of Paramount Global. I say parts because the two companies’ respective ownership of CBS and NBC won’t fly under FCC regulations. That becomes a divestiture-based buying opportunity for private equity or maybe Warner Bros. Discovery.

But Comcast is not alone in the cord-cutting with other providers far less invested on the content side.

Already market penetration rates for the entire industry have plummeted from nearly 90% of U.S. households to just 66% easily the lowest level in more than a decade and down 5 percentage points in just a year.

That total looks better than it is thanks to the virtual MVPDs (Alphabet’s YouTube TV Disney-controlled Hulu Plus Live Fubo Philo etc.) plus what’s left of the satellite TV business. A Horowitz Research year-end report suggests just 51% of U.S. video-content customers get their TV fix through a traditional cable provider. Two years ago that number was 81%.

Survey after survey suggests plenty more subscribers will be joining the cord-cutting cascade in coming months as they get more comfortable navigating connected TVs and streaming apps in the post-lockdown era.

Earlier this year SparkLight (formerly Cable One) said it would stop providing bulk cable services to apartment buildings hotels and similar venues. Getting out of the industry lets Cable One upgrade its high-speed data capabilities while sparing it the “time and energy spent focusing on an unprofitable product offering.” Ouch.

And 2022 was the year that affiliate fee revenue finally dropped industrywide. For years even as the customer base eroded carriage and retransmission fees kept rising keeping total revenue growth on the plus side. No more. Now the total is down despite more fee hikes in the face of a fading economy and softening ad market.

None of this is to say traditional cable TV disappears completely certainly not in 2023. Older media platforms have a way of not going away. AOL still exists. My 81-year-old mother last I checked still gets DVDs from Netflix. She still uses AM radio for goodness sake. And DirecTV too more or less.

There’s still a profitable if sharply declining business serving those tens of millions of customers who still love the best of cable TV: convenience a broad mix of programming a single bill and a customer-service provider you can (eventually) reach on the phone. Private equity certainly will take advantage of the change to buy up distressed assets that it can aggregate and milk for revenue until the bitter end.

And of course the decision of traditional wired cable TV providers to be other things is really about them heading to the parts of their business that are higher margin with longer-term growth prospects.

If they ditch cable TV the companies will still make money off broadband carrying everyone’s streaming apps without the customer service and equipment headaches that providing video service entails.

Comcast Charter Spectrum and other “cable” companies also have found a highly profitable niche selling bargain-priced mobile wireless services that undercut the big carriers. Dish Network’s Charlie Ergen looks pretty smart for his hard pivot into mobile over these past few years even if the transition has been slow.

And there’s the whole smart-home revolution which should accelerate now that Apple Amazon Samsung and Google have gotten behind the Matter standard.

Consumers want to get into automated and remote-controlled home security lighting door locks heating/cooling and other services. But they need a capable pipe reasonable price and help integrating it all. Matter matters and the broadband providers have the customer relationships in-home networking expertise and promotional reach to take advantage.

With all those other ways to make money it may be time to simplify some business models. Let YouTube TV et al deal with never-happy customers regulatory headaches and entitled media companies and broadcasters expecting endless annual fee hikes.

Soon enough some cable TV company will say “enough” and transition to becoming “just"" a broadband/mobile/smart home services company. Who’s it going to be? Maybe we should start a dead pool. Any bets on your end?",,,,,,,,,,,,
CVX,Chevron Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMTgxMjIwMjIvc3RldmVuLWRvbnppZ2VyLWNoZXZyb24tZWN1YWRvci1vaWwtcG9sbHV0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Their Lives Were Ruined by Oil Pollution and a Court Awarded Them $9.5 Billion. But Ecuadorians Have Yet to See a ...,"Steven Donziger is back in his airy mid-century modern apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan engaged over Zoom on a marketing call with a representative of the online publishing platform Substack.

Back and forth they wrestle with a complicated question—who is Steven Donziger—and quickly realize there is no easy answer.

Donziger is a crusading lawyer who led a team that won one of the world’s largest pollution judgments against Chevron on behalf of Indigenous peoples and other residents of the Ecuadorian Amazon in 2011.

He’s also wearing an ankle bracelet having spent the morning checking in at a Bronx halfway house for federal inmates. Connecting those dots is a fraught tale.

The $9.5 billion award he helped secure from an Ecuadorian court covered horrific pollution from oil production by Texaco (acquired by Chevron in 2001) that poisoned the rainforest with oil spills and billions of gallons of toxic wastewater.

But none of Donziger’s original 30000 Ecuadorian clients—suffering and dying from cancers and other diseases that many believe are related to the oil contamination—have received a penny since the original lawsuit was filed in 1993. Nothing.

Here’s what happened.

Three years after the Ecuadorian court ruled on their behalf a U.S. federal district judge in New York found in a countersuit brought by Chevron that Donziger’s team had obtained the Ecuadorian judgment through fraud bribery and extortion.

Among other things Donziger was accused in the countersuit of forging an expert’s signature blackmailing a judge facilitating the ghostwriting of a key piece of evidence and bribing other Ecuadorian judges—acts that Donziger either denies or says were not illegal in Ecuador.

He has criticized the ruling in the U.S. lawsuit which Chevron filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) as a “Manhattan trial judge purporting to overrule Ecuador’s Supreme Court on questions of Ecuadorian law.” Donziger was referring to one of two appellate court decisions in Ecuador that affirmed the $9.5 billion judgment.

Still the RICO lawsuit along with a similar decision from an international arbitration tribunal has so far made the $9.5 billion Ecuadorian judgment unenforceable despite attempts by plaintiffs to collect damages in Canada Argentina and Brazil among the many countries where Chevron has assets.

The ankle bracelet Donziger is wearing stems from Chevron’s attempts to recoup costs and legal fees in the RICO case after the company prevailed.

During the Zoom call with a female Substack representative Donziger’s prison-issued phone rings as he and the woman game out a “tagline” for his forthcoming account with the platform. “This happens multiple times a day” he says of the noise. “It’s crazy.”

Between 2018 and 2019 Donziger refused to turn over his computer and other electronic devices in the fight with Chevron over legal fees and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York declined to prosecute him for contempt of court citing a lack of resources.

The judge who ruled against him in the RICO case then took the highly unusual step in 2019 of appointing a private prosecutor to pursue criminal contempt of court charges for Donziger’s failure to turn over his personal devices. In that separate contempt of court case Donziger was placed on pretrial house arrest.

And then last fall after three more years of litigation a second federal judge in New York found Donziger guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to six months in prison of which he served about a month in a low-security federal prison in Connecticut and the rest on house arrest. On this afternoon in April there are about two weeks left in his sentence.

Donziger tells the Substack representative that he needs to monetize his writing because he’s been disbarred. “I’m a disbarred attorney not a discredited one—quite the opposite” he says defiantly.

Together they go on brainstorming about how to market his column—in other words why should people pay to read what he has to say? It’s a question Donziger has thought a lot about on the cusp of his release.

“So I would say that there’s the Ecuador case” Donziger says. “And then there’s like the lawyer who is probing issues at the intersection of climate human rights and the law. That to me is how to frame it. That’s a pretty good tagline. OK? Climate human rights and the law.”

He’s always been gifted at selling his causes and the wheels in his head are clearly turning. In real time he seems to be working out who he is and who he wants to be.

“Donziger on justice” he says finally satisfied that he’s reached the right conclusion. “Because of the fact that I fought for justice for 28 years for the people of Ecuador against Chevron.”

In Ecuador Plaintiffs With ‘Nothing’

Almost 3000 miles away in the Ecuadorian Amazon Emergildo Criollo speeds up the Aguarico River in a long motorized canoe. The Indigenous Cofán are known as water people and the canoe is their signature vessel. Criollo maneuvers the canoe in an eddy and hops out barefoot walking about 100 yards through a forested area to his two-room wooden aqua-blue home where five of his grandchildren are playing inside.

He believes Texaco’s oil exploration caused the deaths of two of his children and his wife’s uterine cancer by polluting their water. Criollo became involved in the lawsuit brought by Donziger and others in 1993 when he was a young man and went on to become one of the most visible plaintiffs. He appeared alongside Donziger in the 2009 documentary film Crude and was featured in Paul Barrett’s 2014 book about the case Law of the Jungle.

There is a weariness to Criollo now in his 60s as he remembers the day he lost his second child who accidentally swallowed oil-contaminated water while swimming. He’s told the story to many journalists over the last two decades. None of their articles and books have delivered justice for Criollo’s children. Neither have three decades of litigation spanning at least six countries at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars in legal expenditures and attorney fees.

“I’ve fought for 22 years on this case I have nothing to show for it” he says as one of his grandsons wearing a Spider-Man top crawls into his lap.

In the back of Criollo’s house is a large rainwater reclamation tank part of a project initiated by a nonprofit organization to provide communities in the area with safe drinking water now that their traditional sources of water—streams and rivers—are not safe to drink. Criollo said his community needs more reclamation tanks but lacks the money to purchase them.

“Today everything requires money” he says.

Criollo explains that Texaco’s oil exploration transformed the Cofán’s culture in ways that continue to draw many away from the traditional life they knew before the company arrived in the 1960s.

His family had lived upstream on the Aguarico River near the settler town of Lago Agrio about 180 miles east of Quito the Ecuadorian capital. In addition to the Cofán at least four other Indigenous peoples had been living in the region’s lush jungle for hundreds of years. Their ancestral history was culturally entwined with and dependent on the region’s near-pristine waters and mega-rich biodiversity.

After Texaco struck oil here in the late 1960s the company along with American missionaries and the Ecuadorian government carried out a policy to colonize the region and expel Indigenous peoples from their lands.

Forced onto smaller and smaller plots of land the region’s original inhabitants watched black crude and toxic drilling waste pollute their waters kill their animals and taint their food. This history was investigated and documented by the lawyer Judith Kimerling in her 1991 book Amazon Crude hailed by The New York Times as the “Silent Spring of Ecuador.” Now a professor emertius at The City University of New York Kimerling lives a few miles from Donziger in Manhattan.

In her groundbreaking book Kimerling wrote that from 1964 to 1990 Texaco dumped 3.2 million gallons of toxic “produced” water from oil operations and flared nearly 50 million cubic feet of noxious methane gas per day while spilling 17 million gallons of crude in the rainforest.

Texaco used virtually no environmental controls or monitoring Kimerling found despite regulations in the United States prohibiting such conduct. Her research inspired Donziger and other lawyers to file the original 1993 lawsuit. Yet she declined to be a part of their litigation team having doubts about the ethics of the lawyers behind the case after different Indigenous groups approached her asking how the lawyers could claim to represent them without their consent and how they could solve their problems without talking to them. She continues working with Indigenous communities trying to defend the forest from oil extraction in Ecuador to this day.

Shortly after the 1993 lawsuit was filed in U.S. federal court Texaco began settlement negotiations with the Ecuadorian government to end any liability it had for the pollution. By 1998 with the litigation continuing Texaco completed what it said was a $40 million cleanup. Yet independent reviewers of the corporation’s remediation report including the Louisiana-based chemist Wilma Subra said the cleanup was “cosmetic.” Still Ecuador without consulting Criollo or any of the other people affected fully released the company from further legal liability in a series of settlement agreements. The settlement agreements did not release the claims of third parties like Criollo. Kimerling criticized the settlement agreements and how the cleanup was carried out describing it as more like “an agreement between two polluters” to limit their liability than a serious clean up.

In August I visited some of Texaco’s remediated drilling sites that were not subsequently operated by PetroEcuador its local partner and eventual successor or by other oil companies. At first glance the sites looked unremarkably like other swaths of jungle in the area. But where the company’s former waste pits were located vast quantities of oil-like material had risen to the surface commingling with soil and rainwater.

Pools of water had a sheen from oil residue and chunks of oil-blackened soil had the viscosity of children’s Play-Doh laced with remnants of crude and emitting the stench of burnt rubber. Subra who has written U.S. oil industry regulations told me that it was entirely possible that waste from Texaco’s operations could still be traveling through aquatic systems in the region along with pollution from other oil companies contaminating plants animals and people with heavy metals radioactive material and other toxic materials including dioxin and benzene.

Beyond the pollution and displacement Criollo describes other ways in which expanding oil operations have affected the Cofán. The degraded and shrinking forest no longer able to fully provide for the community’s food and medical needs forced the Cofán out of self-sufficiency and into the market economy. The shift has opened a generational divide between older Cofán who want to protect the forest at all costs and younger leaders who are more open to negotiating with oil companies in exchange for payments that support Cofán families he said.

“What I’d like for my grandchildren—there’s a possibility that we can purchase more land and reforest it” Criollo said. “It’s hard for me to imagine my grandchildren anywhere but here in the forest. The question is where will we get the money to buy land?” He made no mention of the uncollected $9.5 billion Ecuadorian court judgment awarded to him and thousands of other plaintiffs.

To a Bronx Halfway House

Before his strategy session with Substack on Zoom Donziger paces around his apartment sipping from a giant plastic cup of iced tea. He is scheduled to check in at a halfway house in the Bronx at 2 p.m. but he’s spent the past hour talking on his cellphone with one of his assistants dictating tweets to his 196000 Twitter followers about the outrages of his confinement.

“Both of my judges had ties to Chevron” he says referring to the U.S. judges who presided over the RICO and criminal contempt cases. “Re-tweet that. People forget that.”

For Donziger social media has been a crucial tool in a war of words with Chevron over who the villain is in this long-running courtroom battle. Each side has crafted its own narrative by emphasizing different facts and using their respective megaphones including competing websites to push those narratives out.

Early on Chevron pounded its legal defenses: Yes the pollution was real but the company had done what it was supposed to do. It had negotiated settlement and release agreements with Ecuador and conducted the required cleanup. If Donziger’s clients had injuries from pollution it was the government of Ecuador and other oil companies they should be suing.

But once Chevron unearthed evidence of apparent misconduct by the attorney’s team the company began to claim that it was the real victim and that Donziger cast as a money-hungry plaintiffs’ lawyer was engaged in a shakedown. In a flash the dispute became all about him.

In a lengthy emailed statement about this article Randy Mastro an attorney representing Chevron said that Donziger had carried out a “longstanding corrupt campaign against Chevron” that he “is not a ‘human rights lawyer’ and that his attempt to hitch his wagon to climate change is a new invention as he tries to follow the media and the money.”

For his part Donziger says everything he did was aimed at helping grievously harmed clients obtain some type of compensation from one of the world’s most powerful corporations—one he contends that has benefited from a global legal system designed to protect it.

Early on in the litigation Donziger took out an advertisement in The New York Times warning Chevron investors that “Texaco comes with a lot of assets and one huge liability.” He helped broker friendly media coverage of his team like a Vanity Fair feature on the Ecuadorian lawyer Pablo Fajardo.

To help win public opinion Donziger commissioned the documentary filmmaker Joe Berlinger to follow his team of lawyers for the making of “Crude.” That decision ultimately led to Chevron’s RICO lawsuit after the company noticed that an early version of the film included a scene in which Donziger’s team privately met with a supposedly independent court-appointed expert.

Chevron invoked that scene in persuading American judges to force Berlinger Donziger’s team and others to turn over film outtakes and internal documents about the case. In one of the outtakes Donziger declares: “’The only language that I believe this judge is going to understand is one of pressure intimidation and humiliation.”

Once the RICO lawsuit was filed in 2011 Donziger shifted his attention to combating what he calls a “coordinated attempt to destroy him” by Chevron and a contingent of the federal judiciary.

He argued that the judge presiding over Chevron’s RICO lawsuit Lewis A. Kaplan showed a disdain for him and an affinity for Chevron throughout the proceedings. At one point Kaplan remarked that Chevron was a “company of considerable importance to our economy.” In a separate action before the RICO lawsuit Kaplan having reviewed some of the Crude outtakes suggested that “Donziger’s own words raise substantial questions as to his possible criminal liability and amenability to professional discipline.”

Donziger has also worked to focus attention on Kaplan’s appointment of a private prosecutor to pursue the contempt of court charges pointing out that the prosecutor worked for a law firm that had in the past represented Chevron. The contempt conviction was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York and a request for Supreme Court review of the case is pending. Donziger has called the situation a “private corporate prosecution.”

A report spearheaded by a former U.S. ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice found that the contempt proceedings violated international human rights laws and that there was “a reasonable appearance of bias” on the part of Judge Kaplan in appointing the prosecutor in the case. The report concluded that the contempt proceedings violated Donziger’s fair trial rights and that his detention was arbitrary.

Donziger has amassed a following of supporters including Bianca Jagger Sting and Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters. Other celebrities drop by his apartment to show their support.

U.S. Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and other members of Congress have written to President Joe Biden requesting a pardon for Donziger. The Guardian newspaper in London asked Donziger to write a regular column. He receives donations from people around the world to cover his living expenses and personal legal fees and another panel of international jurists has condemned Donziger’s nearly three-year detention. (In addition to his six-month contempt sentence Donziger spent nearly two and a half years in pretrial detention on house arrest because of delays linked to the Covid pandemic and continuance requests by his legal team.)

As Donziger walks into the Bronx halfway house there is a slight swagger to his step. He insists that he is winning: “Hugely successful” he says. In and out of the brownstone within 30 minutes he walks the quarter-mile to 188 Cuchifritos his favorite local Peruvian chicken joint. He knows he is expected to go straight home to Manhattan after his mandatory check-ins but he reasons it’s just a quick visit.

Standing at the counter Donzgier leans towards the waitress and in Spanish orders a half roast chicken rice and beans then towering over everyone else in the restaurant at 6 foot 4 watches her prepare his order.

“Eso es un poco pequeño no? [That’s a little small?]” he asks her with a serious face pointing to the piece of chicken on the plate.

The waitress substitutes a larger piece for the chicken and Donziger makes his way to the nearest table where he rips into his meal sucking the meat off the bones before discarding what’s left in a pile on his plate.

When he finishes he pops into a small store next door that sells fresh seafood marveling at how much less expensive fish is in the Bronx than on the Upper West Side. He leaves without buying anything and starts walking toward the subway station stopping to give a few dollars to a man who approaches him asking for money.

Rebel at Harvard Law

The son of a businessman and a schoolteacher Donzgier grew up in a well-to-do suburb of Jacksonville Florida. Early on his mother nurtured a sense of social responsibility in her son taking him to his first rally at a Winn-Dixie grocery store on behalf of farmworkers.

His parents divorced when he was 15 and Donziger became particularly close to his maternal grandfather Aaron E. Koota a former justice of the New York State Supreme Court and a Brooklyn district attorney known as a “tough crime fighter” with a fondness for media attention.

Donziger’s interest in Latin America began with a solo trip to Mexico during a summer break in college. He spent about a month hitchhiking around the country working odd jobs and learning Spanish. A Russian studies major at American University who wrote for the school newspaper Donziger graduated wanting to become a foreign correspondent.

At 23 he took off for Estelí Nicaragua to cover the war between the country’s leftist Sandinista government and the right-wing Contras backed by Ronald Reagan’s administration. Donziger said the experience particularly the U.S. role in the war opened his eyes to the way “government authorities and other forms of entrenched power” can abuse the law and people to get what they want.

At 28 he moved back to the United States with plans to apply to law school. He worked briefly in Atlanta with a legal aid society advocating on behalf of the Cubans incarcerated in the U.S. who had come to America en masse in the 1980 Mariel boatlift.

Then he was off to Harvard Law School where he jostled on the basketball court with a fellow student named Barack Obama and helped organize a 1991 trip to Iraq with a small group of classmates to document civilian casualties during the Persian Gulf War.

Donziger led the law-student contingent and acted as its spokesman. For the first time he had begun to merge his two interests law and the media. That approach would persist as a signature tactic throughout his career.

After his 1991 graduation from Harvard Donziger worked briefly as a public defender in Washington representing juvenile defendants before joining up with one of his former classmates John Bonifaz and his father Cristobol Bonifaz to file the 1993 lawsuit against Texaco in U.S. federal court in New York.

In 2002 Texaco succeeded in having the lawsuit dismissed on the ground that Ecuador was a more appropriate forum for the litigation to take place—a key turning point in the saga and an outcome lambasted by critics for among other things overlooking the fact that the important decisions about Texaco’s operations in Ecuador had been made from its headquarters in White Plains New York.

Donzgier who had been a junior member of the legal team representing the Ecuadorian plaintiffs in New York worked with a new team of lawyers to refile the lawsuit against Chevron in Lago Agrio the next year. Eventually he would ascend to the leadership of the team that won the $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in 2011.



A Sacrifice Zone

Silvia Yanez spent the first years of her young marriage traveling 17 hours by foot and bus every eight days from the Ecuadorian town of Coca to Quito to receive treatment for Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. She too became one of the 30000 individuals Donziger represented in the litigation against Texaco and Chevron.

Dressed in black and pink yoga pants with matching bright pink toenails Yanez now 34 tells her story while sitting on a sofa in her living room. Around her six small dogs and a new kitten vie for her attention.

Newly pregnant when she was diagnosed in 2006 Yanez was faced with a decision: keep the baby and delay treatment for eight months or terminate the pregnancy and receive chemotherapy that would effectively end her ability to have children. Too ill to decide for herself she left the decision to her family which chose the latter option in the belief that it was unlikely that either Yanez or the baby would survive if she tried to carry the child to term. The family scraped together funding for her chemo treatments by selling portions of their land and other possessions to save her life.

Yanez’s voice catches when she shares that she can no longer have children because of the chemotherapy. Her eyes well up as she looks down at the brown shag rug beneath her feet. Around the living room are five large stuffed animals and a collection of small figurines including a tiny childlike angel with its hands clasped in prayer.

Yanez’s story is not unique to Orellana and Sucumbíos Provinces in the Ecuadorian Amazon region. Despite having cancer rates higher than Ecuador as a whole the area has no oncology center. Women make up the majority of cases about 72 percen0 which researchers link to their washing clothing and other household goods in contaminated river water.

The two major cities here Coca and Lago Agrio have an abundance of infrastructure created by and for the oil industry. Instead of sidewalks pipelines line the roads in most places. At nighttime the orange-yellow glow of more than 400 gas flares lights up the sky. The best-paying jobs in town are with PetroEcuador—both Yanez’s husband and mother who is in remission from uterine cancer work for the state-run oil company.

The area is emblematic of the term “sacrifice zone” used by environmental and health advocates to describe parts of the world sacrificed to pollution so that people elsewhere can benefit from oil mineral or other types of production.

Now in remission Yanez works for the Union of People Affected by Texaco or UDAPT a nonprofit organization that represents people affected by oil contamination in the area. Yanez helps sick people make medical appointments arranges transportation for them counsels patients on day-to-day tasks and registers those with documented cancer cases as part of an ongoing research study carried out with the Swiss nongovernmental organization Centrale Sanitaire Suisse Romande and the Ecuadorian health organization Clínica Ambiental. The study began in 2018 after years of unanswered requests for such an accounting by the government.

With few doctors a dispersed population and a high number of rural poor simply counting the number of sick people here has its challenges. On a recent workday Yanez rode nearly an hour on the back of a colleague’s motorbike to visit a prostate cancer patient in palliative care. The man who lives alone in a modest wooden home has been unable to afford his prescribed medication.

Yanez performs reflexology a form of acupressure on his feet to help alleviate his pain. She also counsels his daughter on how she could raise money to help pay for his treatments; they settled on trying to sell homemade tamales in town.

‘Buen Vivir’

About a two-hour drive northwest from Yanez’s house in a small village called San Pablo de Kantesiya Simon Lusitande 70 ambles down a wooden staircase outside his home wearing the traditional clothing of the Siekopai peoples and navy blue crocs. He lowers his lean body onto a small red plastic chair beneath a corrugated tin roof.

Lusitande was also one of Donziger’s clients. Behind his home the Aguarico River audibly gushes through an area of dense rainforest that has belonged to Lusitande’s ancestors for centuries. From generation to generation the Siekopai have passed down knowledge both sacred and pragmatic about the rainforest through lines of shamans including Lusitande.

He understands the healing powers of hundreds of different types of plants as well as the rhythms of the forest. Those teachings long sustained a life of what he described as “buen vivir” which roughly translates into good living in balance with nature.

The Siekopai’s descriptions of buen vivir are backed up by anthropological studies showing that before Texaco’s arrival in the region in the 1960s the Indigenous peoples here had access to plentiful amounts of food and more leisure time than most in the modern Western world.

Lusitande who has childhood memories of that life said that after Texaco began operating in and around the Siekopai’s traditional territory the locals began contracting illnesses that their traditional medicine couldn’t treat.

To pay for Western medicine and associated travel costs some of the Siekopai have taken to growing palm oil trees and logging in San Pablo de Kantesiya. Like crude oil an international thirst for palm oil an additive to consumer products from body lotions to pizza dough has changed things here. Just outside the village palm oil plantations have overtaken swaths of what once was biodiverse forest belonging to the Siekopai.

Together with emissions from gas flares the Aguarico and other rivers and streams have transported pollution from oil operations onto the Siekopai’s land contaminating crops and other plants.

Lusitande said he has two main concerns: He wants someone to clean up the contamination from oil extraction and he wants medical assistance for his people.

Specifically he wants a nearby hospital where people with cancer and other diseases he attributes to the contamination can receive treatment. In 2018 Lusitande lost his wife after a multiyear battle with uterine cancer. She had to discontinue her chemotherapy treatments when the family could no longer afford the drugs and the onerous costs of travel to and from Quito.

According to data from the Swiss study death rates from cancer in this area are higher than the average of Ecuador as a whole in part because of the hardships associated with the costs and difficulties traveling to Quito for treatment.“It’s difficult so difficult” Lusitande says.

His son Nicolas joins him wearing a soft blue long-sleeved shirt and dark blue jeans. Side by side the father and son are the spitting image of each other though 26 years apart in age. Nicolas placed his hand on his father’s shoulder.

“Young people say to me ‘Abuelo (grandfather) you started this fight but you started it a long time ago and we haven’t seen the results’” Lusitande says. “Where’s the money?”

“Nobody listens to us” Nicolas says flatly. “We are at God’s mercy here.”

‘Free Donziger’

When the day of Donziger’s “Freedom Block Party” finally arrives in late April a crowd of about 100 gathers outside his apartment building to celebrate “Steven Donziger’s Release After 993 Days of Illegal Detention” as the event was described on social media.

Wearing a blue button-down oxford shirt that is half tucked in a black blazer and jeans Donziger takes to a makeshift stage under a bright blue spring sky to address the crowd and a livestream audience. “Neither myself nor my family could have done this without the support of each and every one of you and also the support of thousands maybe millions of people around the world” he tells the audience.

To his right a “Free Donziger Chevron Lies” banner hangs along construction scaffolding. Behind the stage are Chris Smalls the labor organizer known for rallying Amazon workers; the actress Susan Sarandon and members of Donziger’s legal team among others.

“It is so much bigger than me” Donziger says. “It is so much bigger. They attacked me to try to intimidate all of us and our whole society into not taking on the industry that is literally destroying our planet” he adds pointing at the crowd to indicate that Chevron had attacked them too. “That was the purpose of my detention.”

The crowd erupts into applause and cheers. Donziger is ebullient. He loves being in front of a crowd and feeling the energy. When he mentions that the federal judge who oversaw his criminal contempt case Loretta A. Preska is a member of the Federalist Society a conservative legal organization those cheers turn into loud boos. “Chevron’s a major funder of the Federalist Society” Donziger says as the boos grow louder and his grin widens.

He passes the microphone around to Smalls some of his lawyers and others. When it is Sarandon’s turn to speak the actress accuses the mainstream media of “a complete blackout” of coverage of Donziger’s case.

“Like everyone else when I heard this story I just couldn’t believe it” Sarandon says with a beaming Donziger behind her right shoulder. “I kept thinking there must be something I don’t know to explain this miscarrage of justice.”

Some lawyers who have closely tracked the litigation take a different view. Kimerling the lawyer whose work inspired the litigation in the first place has been critical of just about everyone involved in the dispute: Donziger Chevron the Ecuadorian government the American judiciary and the international legal system—all of which she argues have in their own way failed the people affected by Texaco’s operations.

Kimerling said that Chevron produced evidence of misconduct by Donziger and his team and that has made the Ecuadorian $9.5 billion judgment vulnerable. She believes that the team claimed to represent all of the affected people without getting their consent and listening to them and at times rebuffed efforts by affected communities who wanted to participate in decisions about their claims. “The oil frontier continues to expand environmental conditions are worsening people’s rights are still being violated and no one is taking responsibility” she says.

Robert Percival a professor of environmental law at the University of Maryland uses the legal dispute as a cautionary tale in his courses. He has called Texaco’s Ecuador operations “reprehensible” and accuses Chevron of “scorched earth” legal tactics in its litigation. And Donziger he says sank his clients’ case by among other things inviting a film crew to document the legal team’s internal deliberations.

Still both Percival and Kimerling say Donziger was treated unfairly by the American courts in the contempt proceedings.

As the sky overhead darkens and the street event winds down. Donziger takes the microphone back for one last word. He reminds people to support his quest for a presidential pardon and to sign up at his website freedonziger.com.

“We’re not going to change that by the way because I’m not fully free” he says referring to his website domain name. “We’re moving on to a new phase. It’s about going on offense and trying to make this company comply with the rule of law and pay the judgments that it owes to the people it poisoned in Ecuador.”

A Sort of Detente

On a backstreet in the town of Sushifindi in Sucumbíos Province Pablo Fajardo sits in his ground-floor law office typing out arguments on his laptop. Behind him hangs a framed photograph of an Indigenous man standing before a large banner on which the words “Justicia” and “Chevron” are visible.

As a young man Fajardo was part of the legal team that won the $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron and like Donziger he was named in the company’s RICO lawsuit. In his 497-page opinion Judge Kaplan found that Fajardo was involved in bribing the Ecuadorian judges and ghostwriting their opinion. Fajardo maintains that the team never engaged in illegal conduct and has accused the American judicial system of “looking down its nose” at Ecuador.

He has continued to practice law out of his Sushifindi office but after the RICO lawsuit had a falling out with Donziger in part over questions about the way litigation funding was spent—Donziger had raised millions of dollars to fund the lawsuits against Texaco and Chevron.

In 2017 the UDAPT organization represented by Fajardo accused Donziger of misappropriating some of that funding and declared him a persona non grata. Fajardo said his clients are the owners of the $9.5 billion judgment and entitled to know how the litigation funding was spent.

Donziger has denied the allegations and said he made a full accounting to his client the Amazon Defense Front an organization that he claims owns the $9.5 billion awarded by the court.

Donziger in turn has struck out at Fajardo accusing him of mishandling an opportunity to collect part of the judgment in 2016.

Donzgier’s grievances encompass two additional legal disputes related to Chevron’s operations in Ecuador that most likely will result in what would in the plaintiffs’ minds be the ultimate injustice: Chevron whose predecessor Texaco polluted the Ecuadorian Amazon walking away with hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in damages paid by the Ecuadorian government. If and when this happens it would also represent perhaps the last chance for the plaintiffs to receive at least a portion of the original $9.5 billion judgment by going after the damages paid by Ecuador—in Ecuador—to Chevron which years ago removed all of its other assets from the country.

The damages Ecuador is soon likely to have to pay to Chevron will come under a 1993 bilateral trade agreement between the United States and Ecuador that gives U.S. investors like Chevron certain protections covering their investments in Ecuador. Among those protections is the right to “fair and equitable treatment” by the Ecuadorian government. The agreement also gives foreign investors the right to institute legal proceedings against the Ecuadorian government before an international panel of arbitrators if those protections are not honored.

Using this arbitration system on a parallel track to the RICO case it brought against Donziger and others Chevron filed two cases against the government of Ecuador. The first filed in 2006 related to a commercial contract dispute over the amount of oil Ecuador claimed it needed for domestic consumption and the second filed in 2009 related to whether the Ecuadorian government treated Chevron unfairly during the lawsuit brought by Donziger’s team.

In its first arbitration against the Ecuadorian government on grounds that Ecuador breached its commercial contract with the company Chevron won a $96 million award in 2011 that by 2016 had with interest grown to $112 million.

This award Donziger believes gave plaintiffs like Yanez Criollo and Lusitande a $112 million asset in the country that they could fight to claim.

Ecuador’s president at the time Rafael Correa went to Fajardo who was then counsel of the Amazon Defense Front and asked him if his clients would waive their right to collect the funds—if the money went to them and Ecuador therefore failed to pay Chevron the government could lose access to desperately needed international funding.

Fajardo said he consulted with his clients about the request and they directed him to waive their claim on the $112 million allowing the government to pay Chevron. Donziger furious at the missed opportunity claimed that Fajardo unilaterally released the embargo giving up the chance to collect part of the $9.5 billion judgment. The Amazon Defense Front fired Fajardo over the dispute.

Chevron’s second arbitration case against Ecuador has caused even more controversy precisely because the company may walk away from the pollution dispute with another multi-million or billion dollar payment.

In 2018 three international arbitrators ruled in Chevron’s favor and against the government of Ecuador. In a 521-page opinion they found that the $9.5 billion judgment was “procured through fraud bribery and corruption and was based on claims that had been already settled and released by the Republic of Ecuador years earlier.” The evidence they cited was similar to the purported misconduct that Judge Kaplan outlined in reaching his conclusion in the U.S. RICO case.

The arbitrators’ ruling also said that the Lago Agrio judgment “should not be recognised or enforced by the courts of other states” making it difficult for the people of the Ecuadorian Amazon to lay claim to assets Chevron has in other countries.

Critics of the ruling including Fajardo argue among other objections that the arbitration unfairly excluded his clients from formal participation in the proceedings even though their right to enforce the $9.5 billion judgment was affected by the outcome.

The arbitration tribunal is now assessing the damages owed to Chevron in the second award. This potentially gives UDAPT or the Amazon Defense Front—depending on which has the rights to the $9.5 billion—another opportunity to lay claim to the damages payment to Chevron.

In recent weeks Fajardo has reached a sort of detente with Donziger with the two agreeing not to attack each other in view of the larger goal of trying to enforce the judgment. Fajardo said he has plans in the works for a new legal effort to claim the $9.5 billion for UDAPT but offered no time frame.

Harvard Law Redux

Late one afternoon last month Donziger dropped in virtually on a “Justice for Lawyers” seminar at Harvard Law School taught by Professor Charles Nesson a member of the legal team that represented Donziger in his New York disbarment proceedings.

Thirty years earlier Donziger sat in a similar classroom. On this night appearing via Zoom he says that if someone had told him back then where he would end up he wouldn’t have believed it. It has been a difficult journey he tells the class but “it turned out better than I thought because after all this time I have a much larger platform and I think I’m getting a lot of support I never had before because people looking at the situation realize what really happened.”

Nesson has called the RICO judgment by Judge Kaplan a “constructed lie” built on what he contends is faulty evidence such as the testimony of a controversial witness the former Ecuadorian judge Alberto Guerra. Guerra’s testimony was a basis for Kaplan’s finding that Donziger bribed Guerra and another judge to secure the Ecuadorian ruling.

Chevron disclosed that ahead of the RICO trial it had paid to relocate Guerra and his family to the United States and had also been giving them money each month to cover their housing and other living expenses.

In testimony before Kaplan Guerra admitted accepting payments from Donziger’s team and working with those lawyers to ghostwrite orders for the Ecuadorian judge who issued the $9.5 billion judgment. Later he repudiated parts of his testimony though not his account that Donziger offered him money to ghostwrite the judgment. Donziger vehemently denies offering such a bribe or participating in the ghostwriting of the judgment.

Nesson contends that Chevron did not prove that Donziger either bribed the Ecuadorian judges or ghostwrote the judgment.

“This idea of ghost writing … if they had proved it is a matter of a lawyer offering assistance in the form of some kind of documents that help a judge write the opinion” Nesson told me in an interview. “There is no law against it and it does not prove that the judge was bribed.”

In the Harvard classroom the professor’s students ask Donziger about the potential legacy of his litigation with Chevron. Donziger says he believes that more lawyers should be trained not just in the law but in how to carry out advocacy campaigns using the media social media and working with politicians to counter the disproportionate power corporations have over plaintiffs in some cases.

“Chevron went to the U.S. government we went to the U.S. government” he tells the students. “They wanted to take out paid ads to trash us; we got free media by holding press conferences. They think they’ll control the narrative; we worked with a documentary filmmaker.”

Donziger isn’t alone in touting his unconventional style. Sarah Leah Whitson a human rights lawyer and former Harvard classmate of the embattled lawyer praised him as brilliant and said “If Steven wasn’t Steven with all his flaws and all of his shortcomings which like any other human he has we wouldn’t have had litigation against Chevron.”

Graham Erion a former lawyer on Donziger’s team said that once the case was moved from the U.S. to Ecuador Donziger was forced to do battle in a context unlike any U.S. court case: “Both sides were in a constant battle” he said adding “I think U.S. courts mainly Kaplan came along and created this horrified impression of how the litigation played out in Ecuador and that’s unfair.”

Whether or not Donziger’s behavior in Ecuador was justified—what Kaplan derided as a “Robin Hood” defense—the Harvard students are intrigued by his story. One of the students asks him about his plans for the future.

He’s writing a book Donziger tells them and is in talks with a studio about a film that would tell his side of the story. And despite the ongoing legal issues stemming from his contempt proceedings he says he is hopeful.

“So I’m feeling pretty good” he says. “I’m not going to say it’s perfect because you know it never really is. But if you get the right perspective and you realize what we’ve accomplished I’m just really proud of everyone who’s worked on this.”

“I’m surprised at myself—I really didn’t ever know I would have the strength and resilience that I’ve had” Donziger adds. “I’m just pleased with myself. You know I’m proud of myself.”

Sophomore Katherine Pavloff’s favorite taqueria is Milagros. She said “I really like the environment at Milagros and everyone is super friendly!”

Milagros’ seating is first come first serve and it does not take reservations. Luckily my three friends and I were immediately able to get seats. They also opt for online ordering as opposed to servers and have a QR code at each table with a link to the menu and ordering site.

The service was swift: we got our food almost immediately after submitting our orders. We started the night with one order of their Traditional Guacamole ($11.95) a Strawberry Daiquiri ($6) a Frozen Lime Margarita ($6) and a Frozen Mango Margarita ($6) all non-alcoholic. The Traditional Guacamole (one of Milagros’ vegan dishes) is fresh and creamy and comes with a bucket of tortilla chips. You can order it mild medium or spicy. The Frozen Margaritas and the Daiquiri were a sweet and refreshing way to start the meal.

“I got the Frozen Lime Margarita and it was super refreshing. I also really enjoyed the chips and guacamole” sophomore Phoebe Matin commented.

For entrees we ordered the Milagros Quesadilla with chicken ($12.95) the Quesabirria Trio ($15.95) one Mahi Mahi Taco ($5.95) one Roasted Carnitas Taco ($4.95) and one Chipotle Chicken Taco ($4.95). The Milagros Quesadilla and the Quesabirria Trio were the table favorites. The quesadilla came with sides of guacamole and sour cream and was packed with flavorful spit-roasted chicken and a cotija oaxaca and manchego cheese blend. The Quesabirria Trio comes with three crispy tacos with juicy birria beef caramelized onions and cheese served with a bowl of consommé radish and grilled jalapeno on a side. Both entrees came in large portions that are great to share with the table.

“I had the quesadilla and it was super good! I also had a quesabirria taco and it was cooked perfectly” Matin said.

The Mahi Mahi Taco the Roasted Carnitas Taco and the Chipotle Chicken Taco (all gluten-free) are smaller portions and are great if you want to try multiple tacos. The Mahi Mahi Taco had perfectly pan-seared mahi mahi with a mild habanero-mango sauce and green salsa. The Roasted Carnitas Taco came with mouthwatering pulled pork carnitas and a rich chipotle aioli. The Chipotle Chicken Taco came with perfectly braised pulled chicken and queso fresco sprinkled on top.

“The meat in the carnitas was super flavorful and well cooked” Pavloff added.

Lastly for dessert we ordered the Warm Chocolate Cake ($9) and the Churros ($8). The Warm Chocolate Cake had chocolate sauce and a dollop of whipped cream and a rich chocolate flavor. The Churros had four pieces served with creamy chocolate and dulce de leche dipping sauces.

Matin’s favorite part of the meal was the dessert. She said “The churros were warm and I really liked the chocolate sauce.”

In 2020 McDonald's opened a restaurant in Walt Disney World that was 100% powered by solar energy reports Fast Company. A combination of solar panels installed on the roof and solar glass windows around the building generated enough energy to keep the entire kitchen and dining room running. At the time Carol Ross Barney head of the architecture firm that designed the building said this project would serve as an experiment for McDonald's to test how far it could make solar power work for its operations. Indeed the transition hasn't come without challenges.

As SolarCompanies.com explains fast food restaurants require more energy than gas stations and retail stores. Industrial freezers grills fryers ordering kiosks and air conditioning take up a lot of power — and for compact fast food restaurants finding space to put all those solar panels can be a challenge. Some fast food stores are even further limited by their geographic locations. Particularly in major cities many restaurants exist on the first floor of a skyscraper. Multiple floors of apartments and offices stacked on top of a ground-floor McDonald's means a solar panel up on the roof isn't a practical placement.

Fast Company reported that by 2030 McDonald's emissions would have to be 36% lower than they were in 2015 to stay on target for the goals it had in 2020. In October 2021 McDonald's announced its goal of becoming totally emissions-neutral by 2050. Recently the company revealed the latest development in its environmental journey: Hundreds of locations are going solar.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9yb2JlcnQtcGF0dGluc29uLWdvdC1tYWtpbmcta3Jpc3Rlbi0xMjAwMDAzNjEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Pattinson Got So Into Making Out With Kristen Stewart That He Fell Off The Bed During 'Twilight',"Robert Pattinson Got So Into Making Out With Kristen Stewart That He Fell Off The Bed During 'Twilight'

Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson had so much chemistry during their Twilight audition that it caused Pattinson to injure himself and the film's director Catherine Hardwicke to warn him after about the age of consent. Hardwicke recalled filming their audition where the two performed Twilight's kissing scene on her bed on The Big Hit Podcast.

She didn't expect a lot of Pattinson when he came in. “[Rob] walked in and he had his hair dyed black for some play with these wacky bangs” she started via Insider. “He was a bit out of shape. His shirt was just all messy and I'm like ‘Oh okay. Okay let's see how this goes.’”

“Rob and Kristen auditioned on my bed the kissing scene Rob was so into it he fell off the bed. I'm like ‘Dude calm down.’ And I'm in there filming with my little video camera whatever” Hardwicke continued.

“At the end [after the audition] Kristen was like ‘It has to be Rob’” Hardwicke said. “I could tell they had a lot of chemistry and I'm like ‘Oh my God.’ I thought Kristen was 17. I don't want to get in some illegal things. So I remember I told Rob ‘By the way Kristen is 17. In our country it's illegal to have a sexual …’ And he's like ‘Oh okay whatever.’” (Stewart and Pattinson went on to date from 2009 to 2012.)

Hardwicke added later in the interview via Buzzfeed that neither Pattinson nor Stewart expected the kind of fame the film brought them—or the backlash for Stewart.

“If you think about it of course a huge chunk of the fan base are young women and they all wanted to be Bella” Hardwicke said. “So they were just by nature jealous of Kristen who got to be in the same room…with Edward that would just be part of it. Nobody could be good enough because they didn't look like them.”

“Kristen yeah that was a tough situation for her to be in. And for Rob both of them” she said. “They really thought they signed on to an indie film with the director of 13 and Lords of Dogtown. That's what we all thought.”

Stewart for what it's worth reflected on her spark-filled audition with Pattinson in an interview with the New Yorker published in November. “It was so clear who worked” Stewart told the outlet with a grin. “I was literally just like...” Stewart mimicked a swoon then elaborated on what made Pattinson so right for the role. “[He had an] intellectual approach that was combined with ‘I don’t give a fuck about this but I’m going to make this sing.’ And I was like ‘Ugh same.’ And whatever we were young and stupid and not to say that we made it so much better but that’s what it needed and that’s what anybody playing those parts needed to feel.”

Worship attendance small group attendance and baptisms were up last year in the SBC’s annual statistical report released Tuesday while membership fell below 13 million.

2023 marks 17 straight years of decline for the country’s biggest Protestant denomination. It’s down 3.3 million from its peak with the steepest drops coming during the pandemic. The SBC lost 1.3 million members between 2020 and 2022 alone.

Beyond COVID-19 disruptions Southern Baptists have recently confronted some contentious issues within their convention responding to sexual abuse and clamping down on female preachers which have led some congregations to leave the SBC (including prominent megachurch Saddleback Church).

But statistics indicate that church departures aren’t a significant driver of membership decline; the SBC was down 292 churches last year just 0.63 percent of its total.

In 2023 membership fell by 241000 its smallest decrease since 2018. Yet attendance at SBC churches increased 6.5 percent reaching above 4 million a week for the first time since the pandemic.

Attendance at small groups and Bible studies ticked up 4 percent to 2.4 million.

With fewer Americans than ever attending church and religious disaffiliation on the rise leaders see even small increases in engagement and discipleship as worth celebrating.

It’s the first time in over a decade that SBC worship attendance has grown two years in a row though it still lags behind pre-pandemic numbers. Back in 2019 SBC churches saw over 5 million show up each Sunday.

“Outreach and discipleship are difficult today. They require time and commitment when our culture offers numerous distractions and alternatives. The pandemic was discouraging as fewer people engaged in these activities” said Scott McConnell executive director of Lifeway Research which releases the annual report.

“But as people have re-engaged and new people are participating there is much to celebrate in Southern Baptist churches today while we invite more to join.”

Baptisms the key metric for Southern Baptists also grew for the second year in a row.

“God has been stirring the waters and an upswing in baptisms has solidly begun” wrote SBC president Bart Barber a pastor in Texas.

“Not only have we experienced a second year of increased baptisms but we have also witnessed a year-over-year gain—25.94 percent more baptisms than in 2022—that leaves no room for doubt about what God is doing among our churches.”

Kevin Ezell president of the North American Mission Board said the baptism trend is widespread across regions. Out of 41 state conventions 35 reported more baptisms in 2023 than 2022.

“Pastors are the difference makers here” he said in a statement. “Despite all the distractions and challenges out there they are keeping the focus on evangelism and encouraging new believers to follow up with baptism.”

The report’s release falls about a month before the SBC’s annual meeting which gathers over 10000 messengers in Indianapolis in June. They are slated to address new mechanisms for overseeing abuse reform and reporting as well as clarifications to cooperation agreements and guidance around women in ministry.

The SBC’s current membership of 12982090 is the lowest since 1976. The membership size peaked at 16.3 million in 2006.

One bright spot leaders say is the generosity of members and churches who spent nearly $800 million on missions last year up 9 percent.

“We are sharing the gospel with more people gathering for worship and Bible study in increasing numbers giving billions to support churches serving communities across our country and sending millions to support mission enterprises around the world” said Jeff Iorg the SBC Executive Committee president-elect.

“Southern Baptists are not a perfect people” he added. “But we are a movement making a positive difference in our world and our most recent statistical report underscores this reality and motivates us to press forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL2FiYzEzLmNvbS9wb3N0L2JydWNlLWhvbGxlbi1jYWx2YXJ5LWNodXJjaC13b29kbGFuZHMtdHgtcGFzdG9yLWFjY3VzZWQtY2hpbGQtcG9ybi1tb250b2dvbWVyeS1jb3VudHktcHJlY2luY3QtMy1jb25zdGFibGVzLzE0Nzk2ODY0L9IBkAFodHRwczovL2FiYzEzLmNvbS9hbXAvcG9zdC9icnVjZS1ob2xsZW4tY2FsdmFyeS1jaHVyY2gtd29vZGxhbmRzLXR4LXBhc3Rvci1hY2N1c2VkLWNoaWxkLXBvcm4tbW9udG9nb21lcnktY291bnR5LXByZWNpbmN0LTMtY29uc3RhYmxlcy8xNDc5Njg2NC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas pastor accused of child porn: Bruce Hollen of Calvary Church in The Woodlands arrested in Montgomery Co.

Bruce Hollen pastor of Calvary Church in The Woodlands is accused of possession child pornography Montgomery County Precinct 4 deputies said.

THE WOODLANDS Texas (KTRK) -- A pastor in The Woodlands stands accused of disturbing crimes involving kids.

Authorities said Bruce Hollen was arrested on May 8 for allegedly promoting and distributing naked pictures of young girls.

His arrest was a result of an operation. The deputies leading the investigation were from Montogomery County Precinct 3 specifically focusing on internet crime against children.

According to investigators Hollen is a pastor at Calvary Church.

Court documents state the photos were of girls between the ages of 9 and 12 years old naked from the waist down.

In some of the images the girls were engaged in sexual activity.

Calvary Church services take place in the auditorium at McCullough Junior High School. The Conroe Independent School District said the services were held on Sundays so students were away.

Hollen and his wife were listed as team members on the church's website but their photos have been taken down.

When ABC13 visited the couple's home Hollen's wife did not open the door and refused to comment on the allegation.

All Calvary Church leadership told ABC13 via a statement that they are doing the best they can to keep things running and they ""don't have all of the information.""

Hollen was booked into the Montgomery County Jail. A judge set his bond at $30000.

Medicare Advantage is the private-sector alternative to the federal program covering those 65 and over and the disabled. By next year more than half of Medicare recipients are expected to be enrolled in private plans. These policies are often less expensive than traditional Medicare and sometimes offer attractive additional benefits like dental care.

Despite their popularity the plans have been the subject of considerable scrutiny and criticism lately. A recent report by the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that several plans might be inappropriately denying care to patients. And nearly every large insurance company in the program including UnitedHealth Group Elevance Health Kaiser Permanente and Cigna has been sued by the Justice Department for fraudulently overcharging the government.

The period leading up to this year’s enrollment deadline Dec. 7 amplified widespread criticism about the deceptive tactics some brokers and insurers had used to entice people to switch plans. In November Senate Democrats issued a scathing report detailing some of the worst practices including ads that appeared to represent federal agencies and ubiquitous television commercials featuring celebrities.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Era itu dikenal dengan sebutan romantisme. Romantisme kemudian muncul sebagai ideologi dalam pemikiran kaum penyair seniman dan filsuf di Eropa pada pertengahan abad ke-18.

Sekarang ide tersebut berupaya menaklukkan dunia. Namun uniknya tidak satu pun hubungan cinta mengikuti kisah klise romantisme yang sama. Walaupun demikian garis besarnya masih sering muncul dan bisa disimpulkan bahwa romantisme bermuara pada keberadaan pernikahan.

Romantisme membuat pernikahan terlihat wajar karena mengikat perasaan kedua manusia dan menggabungkan keduanya dengan kisah cinta yang menggebu---sebuah ide pernikahan yang langgeng dan penuh cinta.

Menjalani pernikahan begitulah cara romantisme menggabungkan cinta dan seksualitas. Sebelumnya orang-orang berpikir bahwa mereka dapat melakukan hubungan seks dengan orang yang tidak mereka cintai dan mereka bisa mencintai seseorang tanpa memiliki keintiman tersebut.

Romantisme mengangkat seksualitas sebagai tanda cinta tertinggi. Bahkan sering kali terjadi seks yang memuaskan menjadi simbol kesuksesan sebuah hubungan. Itu artinya tanpa sengaja romantisme menyatakan bahwa ketika merenggangnya hubungan seks itu sama halnya dengan tidak adanya perasaan cinta lagi.

Romantisme juga membuat kita berpikir bahwa cinta sejati akan mengakhiri seluruh perasaan sepi. Romantisme juga membubuhkan ide bahwa pasangan kita akan selalu mengerti kita tanpa butuh berkomunikasi---tanpa berbicara satu kata pun kepadanya dia akan mengerti jiwa kita.

Romantisme percaya bahwa kita harus memilih pasangan dengan hati bukan logika atau pertimbangan yang masuk akal. Seseorang bisa mengetahui bahwa dia jatuh cinta apabila memiliki perasaan spesial. Faktor ini mengarahkan romatisme ke pandangan negatif pada logika dan uang---dingin dan tidak romantis. Cinta kemudian mengatakan bahwa kita telah menemukan pasangan tepat dengan memilih di antara dua sebab: Cocok secara finansial atau cocok dalam hal etika dan perilaku.

Cinta sejati akan menerima kita apa adanya. Jika dalam satu kejadian salah satu ingin berubah kecenderungannya bisa dianggap sebagai isyarat bahwa hubungan itu akan rusak atau hancur. ""Kamu harus berubah"" terasa seperti paksaan yang pahit. Pengertian cinta seperti itu telah ada selama bertahun-tahun. Meski penuh keindahan dan kebahagiaan romantisme telah menghancurkan banyak hubungan.

Romantisme adalah gerakan intelektual dan spiritual yang berefek pahit jika disematkan pada kemampuan manusia untuk memiliki kehidupan emosional yang sukses. Keselamatan cinta hadir dalam menyadari ""keanehan"" dalam romantisme memunculkan beberapa mitos dalam romantisme bahwa kita akan menemukan seseorang dengan fisik rupawan dan jiwa yang menawan lalu kita akan merasa tertarik secara langsung begitu pula sebaliknya.

Bahwa setiap pasangan akan memiliki hubungan seks yang memuaskan dari awal hingga akhir bahwa kita tidak akan tertarik kepada orang lain selain pasangan kita bahwa kita akan selalu mengerti pasangan kita tanpa berbicara maka kita tidak butuh edukasi dalam cinta.

Kita mungkin membutuhkan ilmu untuk menjadi guru pilot atau dokter tetapi menjadi seorang pecinta tidak memerlukannya. Kita belajar sambil berjalan dengan mengikuti perasaan kita bahwa pasangan tidak akan memiliki rahasia satu sama lain dan selalu menghabiskan waktu bersama sehingga pekerjaan tidak mengganggu hubungan kita.

announcement

Washington DC — Cybastion an emerging leader in the field of cybersecurity took centre stage at side events of the U.S. - Africa Leaders Summit. The cybersecurity firm was also the platinum sponsor for the US - Africa Business Forum event. (USABF)

The USABF event took place on the Summit's second day (December 14). It was hosted by the White House the U.S. Department of Commerce the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Corporate Council on Africa in partnership with the Prosper Africa initiative.

Speaking at the USABF event on Wednesday President Biden announced over $15 billion in two-way trade and investment commitments deals and partnerships that advance key priorities including sustainable energy health systems agribusiness digital connectivity infrastructure and finance. He said ""Altogether the forum has spurred more than $15 billion in new deals which will turn lift up and improve lives of people all across the continent. And that's the biggest deal of all.""

President Biden also announced a new initiative the Digital Transformation with Africa (DTA). A signature initiative of the Biden-Harris Administration DTA will expand digital access and literacy and strengthen digital enabling environments across the continent. He said ""We are working with Congress to invest $350 million to facilitate more than almost half a billion dollars in financing to make sure more people across Africa can participate in the digital economy.""

And in a major coup for Cybastion the President went on to mention Cybastion in his speech saying ""Cisco Systems and Cybastion a diaspora-owned small business is jointly announcing $800 million in new contracts to protect African countries from cyber threats.""

Some of the deals President Biden refers to were signed at the Summit with Cybastion signing deals with four African countries Cote d'Ivoire Benin Burkina Faso and Congo and Coris Bank.

Cybastion a one-stop shop for all cybersecurity needs offers cybersecurity solutions infrastructure and digital technologies. The company is headquartered in Durham North Carolina and has a large footprint in Africa working in 8 countries. Cybastion seeks to bridge the gap between Africa's cybersecurity and more developed countries with cybersecurity solutions infrastructure and digital technologies.

CEO and President of Cybastion Dr Thierry Wandji also spoke at the USABF's event saying ""Our uniquely American answer involves a consortium of U.S.-based companies spearheaded by a diaspora-led company that is here to help Africa achieve Digital 2.0 where cybersecurity is a shared occupation and where skills development is de rigeur.""

Cybastion's work in building capacity in Africa is particularly important because as President Biden says ""When Africa succeeds the United States succeeds; quite frankly the whole world succeeds as well.""

I'm senior reporter Phil Rosen.

Today's newsletter features my conversation with Citi's Ed Morse one of the top energy economists and oil-market forecasters in the business.

In a wide-ranging conversation he breaks down Russia and the US crude prices and more.

Then I've got a full slate of weekend reads just for you from across Insider's Pulitzer prize-winning newsroom.

If this was forwarded to you sign up here. Download Insider's app here.

Ed Morse is the global head of commodity research at Citi Group. This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Phil Rosen: What will energy markets look like in 2023 and what's your oil price forecast?

Ed Morse: We have an average price for Brent at the end of the year at $76 a barrel. We have WTI ending the year under $70 a barrel. Overall there will be more market weakness.

It'll be another volatile year but not quite as volatile as 2022. There will be major uncertainty around what we call the ""fragile five"" producers: Iran Iraq Nigeria Libya and Venezuela. And Russian supply is less certain than in the past.

We have an underlying view that we will see an imbalance between supply and demand across 2023 with significantly more supply coming into the market than demand leading to inventory builds which should weigh on prices so that we see prices ending the year on average lower than the beginning.

How has Russia's role in energy markets changed since it invaded Ukraine?







EM: There's been a critical build up in anti-Russian sentiment in Europe and a rethinking of that relationship that Europe is overly dependent on Russian supplies. So we had companies — even before governments got involved — saying they were not going to import Russian oil and gas.

The surge in Brent from around $85 to $125 a barrel earlier this year was not a function of supply versus demand but a function of large distortions in the market in which the readily available supply from a close source was being shunned.

How has the US's role changed in global energy markets this year?

EM: There was a stunning impact on American oil. The US started the year as a 7-million-barrel-a-day exporter of crude products. As the year is ending our exports have been averaging closer to 10 million barrels a day and at times close to 11 million. The US supply system has played a really significant role in filling the gaps.

And Wednesday data showed the US was exporting 1.483 million barrels a day of diesel — in other words there's been a 91.8% increase in US exports in diesel. So US refineries are running all out we're exporting a hell of a lot.

What impact have the West's sanctions had on Russia and markets?

EM: The impact of December 5 sanctions was not nearly as great as the impact of the shunning of Russian oil at the beginning of the year.

But there's clear evidence that sanctions are having a punitive impact on Russia's natural gas. The argument had been that the actions had not punished Russia and that the price of oil had gone up and Russia was receiving more revenue than it otherwise would have. But it turned out that the drop in revenue from natural gas exports being lost to Europe had no replacement whatsoever because there was no other place to sell the gas to so revenue from gas exports plummeted.

By August Russians felt the impact of less revenue on the natural-gas side. That's as quasi-permanent as anything can be for Russian revenue and their plans had been to expand Russia's position in the natural gas market not to contract it. They will never be able to replace the lost supply going to Europe. Russia simply doesn't have the technology or the ability to penetrate markets given the reputational risk.

And on the oil side the lower prices go as long as there's a discount on Russian crude they get punished for it all else equal.

Should energy markets be concerned about the February sanctions on refined Russian fuels?

EM: Energy markets have been very concerned about it but their concern is slowing. The diesel market's been exceptionally tight and the big gap in Europe's supply has been in diesel where they have turned to Russia for most supply.

But now it's the case that diesel has become more abundant.

China is exporting diesel again and may be exporting a record amount of it by the time we get to the first quarter of 2023. Supply has been building in Europe with refineries making more diesel on their own. There's more refining capacity available in the world with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia increasing refining capacity.

But the major astonishing element really is the US as I said earlier.

Here's what else to read this weekend:

1. Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have had lavish colorful lives since they left the company. Private islands flying cars and psychedelic parties are just part of the story. Dig into the wild post-Google endeavors of the two visionaries.

2. Tech has endured massive layoffs and a broad downturn. And yet most laid-off staffers are finding new jobs within three months and many are even scoring raises. There's been a surprising silver lining to the massive job cuts.

3. YouTuber Ali Abdaal makes productivity videos for his 3.6 million subscribers. Since leaving medicine in 2020 to pursue content-creation he's diversified his income streams with online courses selling physical products and a book. His company generated $3.6 million last year — here's how much he's making in 2022.

4. Netflix ushered in a grand streaming revolution. We now have dozens of streaming apps hundreds of new shows and thousands of movies at our fingertips. So why does it feel like there's nothing to watch?

5. Private equity firms are hunting for tech companies to back amid a broad slashing of valuations — and according to bankers and private data these are the 34 names that are most likely to be on their holiday shopping lists.

Finding the right one for you will likely have a profound impact on your financial future. Luckily these experts are here to help.

Edited by John Bruno Turiano and Nick Brandi

We didn’t need World Population Review to tell us that Westchester is one of the richest communities in the U.S. Yet as of this year that same demographics research company placed nine Westchester County towns among the top 100 richest towns in America — more than any other county in the U.S. With all that accumulated wealth it follows that Westchester would attract some of the most experienced and talented wealth advisors to be found anywhere. But isolating the best of the best is no mean feat so WM hired data-research company DataJoe to conduct an exhaustive multitiered survey to determine and document the county’s top 314 wealth managers.

Korea Times file



Five major Korean banks have offered a voluntary retirement program to their 2400 employees this year despite record profits amid higher interest rates industry sources said Sunday.



The voluntary retirement plans at the five lenders ― KB Kookmin Shinhan Woori Hana and NH Nonghyup ― are accelerating as an increasing number of people turn to non-contact financial transactions due to the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.



Those who apply for the program will receive years of their salaries worth up to 400 million-500 million won ($305000-$380000) depending on position educational expenses for children and other benefits an industry official said.



In the overall banking industry at least 3000 workers are expected to quit through the retirement program this year.



Last year more than 5000 employees accepted the retirement program in the banking sector including 2100 employees at Citibank Korea the Korean unit of U.S. banking giant Citigroup as it decided to close its retail banking services.



The number of bank branch closures continued from 74 in 2018 94 in 2019 216 in 2020 209 in 2021 and 179 this year through August according to the Financial Supervisory Service. (Yonhap)

State Rep. Jim Gregory’s history with the Pittsburgh Pirates goes back well before he ran for public office.

He spent 12 years as a sports reporter for WTAJ-TV and covered the Pirates’ division wins in the early 1990s.

“One of my prized possessions is a picture of me doing an interview in the Pirates clubhouse after they clinched the division in 1991 and Stan Belinda is pouring a beer over my head” Gregory R-Blair told City & State.

Such fond memories are one of the several reasons why Gregory alongside Rep. Tim Bonner R-Mercer introduced a proposal to review the economic impact of pro sports stadiums and teams’ financial calculations.

The two western Pennsylvania lawmakers have proposed legislation that would require audits related to the construction of the four sports stadiums in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. With the current legislative session ending at the end of the year Gregory and Bonner shared a co-sponsorship memo in October to gauge interest among members ahead of next year when they plan to reintroduce the bill.

The Legislature “had a big role at that time in getting the stadiums done” Gregory said. “This is the legislature’s way to provide a picture for the entities that will sit at that table and will renegotiate those new leases to know exactly what the return on that investment is.”

The four stadiums – the Eagles’ Lincoln Financial Field the Phillies’ Citizens Bank Park the Steelers’ Acrisure Stadium and the Pirates’ PNC Park – were given state funds through Act 1 of 1999 known as the Capital Facilities Debt Enabling Act.

At the time the teams negotiated with Harrisburg lawmakers in order to get a total of $320 million in grants between 2002 and 2006. The Philadelphia teams each received $85 million and each Pittsburgh team received $75 million in an agreement with the 30-year lease term. The terms of the deal also required the teams to report finances in 10-year intervals with each team expected to prove it generated at least $25 million in additional tax revenues – or pay the difference.

All of the teams exceeded that amount in their first reports and as the second 10-year reports are expected this month the legislation calls for two specific measures to provide further transparency.

With Act 1 of 1999 being focused on keeping baseball teams in the state the first measure requires the Independent Fiscal Office to conduct studies looking at the regional economic benefits resulting from the two taxpayer-funded ballparks for the Phillies and Pirates. The second would require the Auditor General to audit the team’s financial calculations.

While both Gregory and Bonner said they don’t anticipate any wrongdoings on behalf of the teams they’re particularly concerned with teams like the Pirates that have shown decreased attendance and on-field success not only compared to their cross-state rival but across the league as well.

“I do believe that the region is concerned about the level of spending by the Pirates. We’re usually ranked in the bottom five in the payroll of all Major League Baseball teams and our attendance reflects that” Bonner a Republican from Butler County told City & State. “What’s the difference of the economic impact of the two teams in their respective regions – and whether in fact having a more successful team with higher attendance has greater economic impact on the region – that’s part of the study.”

Whether on-field performance has a positive impact on the economic benefits of a sports stadium remains up in the air. However economists largely agree that the pros of having taxpayer-funded sports stadiums don’t outweigh the cons at least in terms of spending brought into the region.

Robert Baade an economist at Lake Forest College who specializes in stadium finance told City & State that leakage – where revenues are taken out of the economy and utilized elsewhere – often occurs with sports revenue where the city is not benefiting from the dollars spent at the stadium. Baade described it as a “reverse Robin Hood effect.”

“You have residents spending money on an activity where most of the revenue generated through the hosting of professional sports teams goes to owners and players … who in some cases don’t live in the city in which they are operating the franchise. The leaders do not live in the community in which they play” Baade said. “If you spent that money on a locally-owned and -operated entertainment activity you’d have much less leakage.”

Michael Leeds a sports economist and professor at Temple University agreed stating that cities and local politicians are “damned if you do and damned if you don’t” in situations involving publicly funded sports stadiums. The economic benefits teams and stadiums bring to cities may not live up to expectations but no politician wants to see a team leave their city on their watch.

“The lawmakers aren’t necessarily trying to attack the sports teams because that’s not necessarily good politics” Leeds said. “They’re just more looking for the side of transparency and understanding what’s actually happening to taxpayers in those cities.”

That’s why we’re doing this – to show that it is or it isn’t (worth it) and I’m pretty confident that we’re going to see that it has been for the most part. – State Rep. Jim Gregory R-Blair

Stadium benefits are calculated using multipliers which attempt to measure the domino effect when spending subsequently causes more spending or other related economic activity. For larger cities like Philadelphia the multiplier effect is likely much smaller as a proportion of the city’s economy when compared to smaller cities such as Pittsburgh.

“Chicago is one of a handful of cities that has four major sports located within the city limits … The income they generate is a fraction of 1% of the total income generated in Chicago in a given year” Leeds said.

Leeds added that although sports teams garner a lot more attention relative to their economic footprint that doesn’t diminish their fiscal contributions.

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing. That’s one of the things I want to emphasize that this is something that an audit will not take account of. These sports teams are not necessarily here to make a profit for the city. Maybe that’s not what we should be looking for” he said. “Do they make us happy?”

Leeds said for future stadium negotiations and any consideration of taxpayer-funded subsidies the key is for officials to “read the fine print” regarding the overall costs.

Teams could “say the city won’t have to pay construction costs but they will have to provide us with the land they will have to undergo all sorts of infrastructure expenditure – and they will have to provide us with all sorts of tax breaks. It’s very very important not to get caught up in

what the team is saying” Leeds said.

Despite the concerns over public financing of stadiums Gregory reiterated that the audit proposal isn’t aimed at uncovering wrongdoing by a team’s financial department but to give the public an idea of what it’s getting in return for its investment.

“There are many folks who don’t agree with stadiums being funded publicly; they don’t want to be held hostage. And then there’s the other side of that issue where people feel like the investment is worth it” Gregory said. “That’s why we’re doing this – to show that it is or it isn’t (worth it) and I’m pretty confident that we’re going to see that it has been for the most part.”

An Eagles spokesperson declined to comment and representatives from the Steelers and Pirates did not respond by press time.

Finding the right one for you will likely have a profound impact on your financial future. Luckily these experts are here to help.

Edited by John Bruno Turiano and Nick Brandi

We didn’t need World Population Review to tell us that Westchester is one of the richest communities in the U.S. Yet as of this year that same demographics research company placed nine Westchester County towns among the top 100 richest towns in America — more than any other county in the U.S. With all that accumulated wealth it follows that Westchester would attract some of the most experienced and talented wealth advisors to be found anywhere. But isolating the best of the best is no mean feat so WM hired data-research company DataJoe to conduct an exhaustive multitiered survey to determine and document the county’s top 314 wealth managers.

If you want to see more cheap NASDAQ stocks to buy go directly to 5 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks to Buy.

NASDAQ stocks are stocks listed on stock exchange named 'The Nasdaq Stock Market' which is also commonly just known as the Nasdaq.

In terms of the Nasdaq it is the largest U.S. equities exchange by volume and also the first electronic stock exchange in the world given its founding in 1971. As an electronic stock exchange the Nasdaq has no psychical trading floors and is instead built on an automated network of computers that match buy and sell orders.

By being fully electronic there is potential for the Nasdaq to be faster than its main competitor The New York Stock Exchange which has a hybrid system that includes both an electronic trading network and a physical trading floor.

As an electronic only stock exchange it is perhaps more fitting that the Nasdaq is home to many big tech companies such as Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) whose stocks are listed on the exchange.

Given the growth of the technology industry in the last three decades the market capitalization of some of the stocks listed on the Nasdaq has increased substantially.

2022

Given high inflation in 2022 the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year. As a result of the interest rate increases Treasury yields have increased substantially and capital has moved from the tech sector into U.S. government bonds as a result.

As a result of the capital outflow the valuations of many growth companies and big tech companies listed on the Nasdaq have decreased.

The Nasdaq Composite which is a market capitalization weighted stock market index that includes nearly all of the stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange has decreased substantially as a result.

Given the decrease some leading blue chip stocks listed on the Nasdaq arguably trade below their intrinsic values which make them potentially 'cheap' stocks.

Given the uncertainty it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors however.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32

Nasdaq Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) is the owner of the stock exchange named 'The Nasdaq Stock Market'. While shares of Nasdaq Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) have declined 13.4% year to date the company's most recent quarterly earnings have nevertheless increased.

For Q3 Nasdaq Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ)'s third quarter net sales rose 6% year over year and adjusted diluted EPS increased 15% year over year to $0.68 per share.

10. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51

ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is a leading maker of semiconductor production equipment. Given the barriers to entry in the company's niche ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has very few legitimate competitors. As a result ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has substantial pricing power and substantial earnings growth potential given the expected increases in semiconductor demand in the future.

Although its shares trade for a forward P/E ratio of 30.02 ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)'s high quality business and its earnings growth potential make the stock cheap.

9. CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60

CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is a marketplace company that operates the world's largest financial derivatives exchange. While its shares have declined 25.1% year to date CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME)'s business remains relatively steady which arguably could make the stock cheap in the long term. In terms of the marketplace's November statistics average daily volume rose 1% year over year to 23.5 million contracts representing the highest November volume on record.

Baron Funds commented on CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) in a Q3 2022 investor letter

CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) operates the world’s largest and most diversified derivatives marketplace. Shares fell 13% during the quarter (despite reporting strong average daily trading volume growth of 26% year-over year) due to concerns that EPS growth will slow in 2023 as the rate hike cycle comes to an end. We continue to own the stock due to CME’s strong competitive moats its product breadth and liquidity depth its durable growth characteristics driven by the secular shift from uncleared over-the-counter trading to exchange-traded futures and tailwinds from the rising rate environment.

8. CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61

Given its year to date decline of 15.82% CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) trades for a forward P/E ratio of 16.65 which is attractive in terms of the long term given railroad's competitive advantages.

Considering railroads are an oligopoly CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) has pricing power which helps the company increase earnings despite the tough macroeconomic environment. For Q3 CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX)'s diluted EPS rose 21% year over year to $0.52 and its sales rose 18% year over year to $3.9 billion.

Of the 920 hedge funds in our database 61 owned shares of CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) at the end of Q3 ranking the stock #8 on our list of 11 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks to Buy.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72

Beverage and snack maker PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has a high quality business given its shares are near an all time high at a time when the S&P 500 has declined 19.68% year to date and the Nasdaq Composite index has fallen 32.38% year to date.

One reason for the strong performance is that analysts expect PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to earn $6.78 per share in 2022 $7.29 per share in 2023 and $7.92 per share in 2024. If PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) can keep increasing its earnings like analysts expect the company could be cheap in the long term.

6. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73

Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is a leading entertainment and communications conglomerate whose shares have declined 31.47% year to date. Given the decline the company trades for a forward P/E ratio of 9.17 which could be cheap if Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) meets earnings estimates for the future.

In terms of the next three years analysts expect the company to steadily grow profits given the earnings estimate of $3.59 per share in 2022 $3.75 per share in 2023 and $4.18 per share in 2024.

Like Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are NASDAQ stocks that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of the third quarter.

In 2012 a relatively unknown musician sitting in the corner of a sofa strumming his guitar in a small recording studio shot up in the indie music scene with his song Raat Raazi . A decade later Prateek Kuhad has come a long way since making it to Barack Obama 's playlist and becoming the first solo Indian musician to sign with a record label that boasts of recording with iconic names like The Doors Eagles Joni Mitchelle etc.This year the Cold/Mess singer sits in the corner of a sofa again albeit appearing more confident as he talks about creating love songs and about music losing its essence on reels.From starting out with intimate gigs to headlining the shows Prateek has had a slow appreciation for live gigs. ""I wasn't the biggest fan early on in my career but the more I did live gigs the better I got at them. It becomes a virtuous cycle"" he says. However having gone through a writing slump during the pandemic the singer-songwriter is now ecstatic to return to a month-long North America tour with songs from his upcoming album The Way That Lovers Do. He shares ""We started doing some shows last year. Even people were excited to be back to live shows after all this time. Honestly I was uninspired during the pandemic. I barely wrote anything. Just being in the same house for so long and the same studio; it becomes stale. If I don't have a new context to interact with I struggle with ideas and I don't feel like I am growing.""His latest album comprises 11 songs touching upon themes of human love friendship and connectivity. The musician recorded at Seattle's secluded Bear Creek Studio with Ryan Hadlock. Compared to the prior folksier sounds Prateek wanted to experiment with pop music and try out new production techniques. He shares ""I feel really good about this album not just in terms of writing but this will be the best produced album I would be putting out.""Musically the acoustic guitar and hollow piano notes blending with soft vocals have become a trademark for Prateek . His lyrics paint a picture of star-crossed lovers finding comfort under starry nights or the painful sighs of a lover giving up. However the singer emphasizes that he has explored varied themes but the romantic songs are the ones that usually catch the attention. He says ""Dil Beparvah was never about love. It is a song about passion for music. If you go through the lyrics it is about wanting to do something you are passionate about. My upcoming song Favourite Peeps is about friendship while Phase is about existentialism and anxiety."" The singer-songwriter isn't averse to being labelled as a musician primarily writing love songs. ""I honestly love writing love songs. Think about your top favourite songs and I bet over half of them are love songs. We are humans and love is the most important emotion in the world. Families and relationships are built based on love so it isn't surprising that love songs resonate the most with people.""His music picked up quite a bit during the pandemic with people making many reels on social media. However he doesn't feel that works in any musician's favour. He shares ""I hope people will eventually transition out of this. Writing songs and building a connection with people through your music is very different from the context in which the music or song is used on social media. Yes there are pros through social media but it won't necessarily translate into future consistent success.""From playing for ten people in the beginning of his career to going on solo tours Prateek has experienced the transition of the live audience. However he feels that more than the comparison between playing on foreign grounds to homeland it is the number of people that makes a difference. ""I played a show in San Francisco with 800 people in attendance which felt similar to the Indian shows. With larger shows there is a lot more energy versus with smaller shows where the mood is a little somber. I really like that more.""The singer points out that playing for a smaller quieter crowd is experientially quite different from concerts where people are drunk and dancing. ""When I play Kasoor or Your time people get energetic but if the same songs are played in a smaller room where people are quieter then we even as a band dynamically bring everything down and make subtle changes that make the songs listener-friendly. We did a show in Montreal with 50-60 people and people were listening and singing along a little bit which felt quite nice.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvZXVyb3BlYW4tb2ZmaWNpYWxzLWFjY3VzZS11c2Etb2YtbWFraW5nLXByb2ZpdHMtZnJvbS11a3JhaW5lLXdhci9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjMyMjc4MS5jbXPSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93b3JsZC1uZXdzL2V1cm9wZWFuLW9mZmljaWFscy1hY2N1c2UtdXNhLW9mLW1ha2luZy1wcm9maXRzLWZyb20tdWtyYWluZS13YXIvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2MzIyNzgxLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,European officials accuse USA of making profits from Ukraine war,"

European officials are accusing the USA of making profits from the Ukraine war in the energy and defence sectors while Europe suffers.Top European officials are reportedly upset with the USA administration and alleged that the USA is making a fortune from the war even as the EU suffers according to a report in a leading Western media.“The fact is if you look at it soberly the country that is most profiting from this war is the U.S. because they are selling more gas and at higher prices and because they are selling more weapons” one senior official recently told POLITICO  a leading media house from USA and Europe.“We are really at a historic juncture” the senior EU official said arguing that the double hit of trade disruption from U.S. subsidies and high energy prices risks turning public opinion against both the war effort and the transatlantic alliance. “America needs to realize that public opinion is shifting in many EU countries.”Another top official the EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell called on Washington to respond to European concerns. “Americans — our friends — take decisions which have an economic impact on us” he said in an interview with POLITICO.The USA has dismissed Europe's views. “The rise in gas prices in Europe is caused by Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and Putin 's energy war against Europe period"" a spokesperson for Biden's National Security Council said reported Politico.EU countries are turning to gas from the U.S. instead — but the price Europeans pay is almost four times as high as the same fuel costs in America. Then there’s the likely surge in orders for American-made military kit as European armies run short after sending weapons to Ukraine according to Politico.French President Emmanuel Macron had said high U.S. gas prices were not “friendly” and Germany’s economy minister had called on Washington to show more “solidarity” and help reduce energy costs.EU Ministers and diplomats are reportedly frustrated at the way Biden administration is ignoring the impact of its domestic economic policies on European allies.""The Inflation Reduction Act is very worrying"" said Dutch Trade Minister Liesje Schreinemacher reported the Politico. ""The potential impact on the European economy is very big.""""The U.S. is following a domestic agenda which is regrettably protectionist and discriminates against U.S. allies"" said Tonino Picula the European Parliament's lead person on the transatlantic relationship reported The Politico.""The United States sells us its gas with a multiplier effect of four when it crosses the Atlantic"" European Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton has recently said on French TV.There is also an allegation about the profits for the American defence sector.The U.S. has by far been the largest provider of military aid to Ukraine supplying more than $15.2 billion in weapons and equipment since the start of the war. The EU has so far provided about €8 billion of military equipment to Ukraine according to Borrell.According to one senior official from a European capital restocking of some sophisticated weapons may take “years” because of problems in the supply chain and the production of chips. This has fueled fears that the U.S. defense industry can profit even more from the war The Politico reported.“The Biden administration has ramped up military aid to Ukraine to an unprecedented degree…It’s also been good business for US defense contractors. Among the biggest winners are Lockheed Martin Raytheon  and Northrop Grumman. Each of their stocks has climbed since Russia’s invasion with Lockheed up about 38 per cent this year” according to a report in Vox.com",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvaW5kbC1nb29kcy9zdnMvbWV0YWxzLW1pbmluZy9jb2FsLWlzLWhlcmUtdG8tc3RheS1kZXNwaXRlLWluZGlhcy1hbWJpdGlvdXMtcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS1nb2Fscy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjMxNzQ4NC5jbXPSAaMBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2luZGwtZ29vZHMvc3ZzL21ldGFscy1taW5pbmcvY29hbC1pcy1oZXJlLXRvLXN0YXktZGVzcGl0ZS1pbmRpYXMtYW1iaXRpb3VzLXJlbmV3YWJsZS1lbmVyZ3ktZ29hbHMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2MzE3NDg0LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coal is here to stay despite India's ambitious renewable energy goals,"

Coal is dirty -- it makes up for 40 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels its mining wreaks havoc on the environment and burning it produces pollutants like mercury which are linked to acid rain and particulate matter that causes respiratory illnesses. But the war in Ukraine has caused a mini-energy crisis globally pushing its use to record levels this year.And India  the world's third largest energy consumer was at the forefront of the global rise in coal usage as it fell back on the easiest available fossil fuel in the face of a surge in oil and gas prices that threatened to derail the economic recovery from the pandemic.The trends of coal consumption and production this year indicate that the dirty fuel is here to stay despite the nation's ambitious target of meeting 50 per cent of energy requirements from renewable energy and non-fossil fuel capacity of 500 GW by 2030.India's coal consumption has doubled since 2007 at an annual growth rate of 6 per cent and the International Energy Agency IEA ) estimates that the largest increase in the fuel's demand globally this year was from India (7 per cent or an addition of 70 million tonnes). This on top of a 14 per cent rebound in 2021 and 1033 million tonnes consumption in 2022.And this demand is led by its electricity generation which is overly reliant on coal. Coal-fired electricity generation accounts for about 73 per cent of India's overall power needs and is likely to remain the most important source of electricity in the foreseeable future. Coal-fired power plants make up 50 per cent of the overall installed capacity of 404 GW connected to grids with another 25 GW currently under construction.The IEA expects India's coal demand to rise steadily to 1220 million tonnes in 2025 with 92 per cent of this going into electricity generation. Electricity demand too is seen growing at 7 per cent.The government which has been propagating self-reliance and cutting down imports has been pushing for raising domestic coal production not just to meet the surge in demand but also to avoid summer blackouts.Coal production in 2021 reached 800 million tonnes for the first time and is forecast to surpass 1 billion tonnes by 2025.Nevertheless by targeting a share of 50 per cent renewables in its power mix by 2030 the government is in the medium term seeking to alleviate the electricity sector's dependency on coal and reduce the cost of energy generation. It mandated 81 coal fired power plants to reduce power generation by a total of about 58 terawatt-hour (TWh) over the next four years however without shutting down any of the country's 172 power plants connected to the grid.The coal ministry plans to boost the country's output to one billion tonnes in the next financial year and aims to see highest production and dispatch in the coming year 2023.The ministry also desires to make some significant achievements in the area of coal gasification in the new year.Speaking to PTI Coal and Mines Minister Pralhad Joshi unveiled the plans for the next year and said the coal output of one billion tonnes will come from different sources which consist of state-owned CIL  commercial mines and captive coal blocks.""We want to see that there is highest production and dispatch as far as coal is concerned. The entire coal production in the country will be one billion tonnes"" Joshi said. Coal India (CIL) accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output.In the mineral sector Joshi said the Centre is eyeing some more amendments in the mining act which can happen in the second half of the Budget session of Parliament . Besides the ministry plans to put on sale 500 mineral blocks in the financial year 2024-25.India has come a long way. Joshi said earlier the country's production was 582 million tonnes and today it is 870 MT. This output will reach 900 million tonnes by the end of the current financial year.The launch of the sixth tranche of commercial coal mines auction under which the government offered 141 blocks across 11 states -- the biggest auction so far for the key commodity -- is one of the achievements of his ministry in the current year the coal minister explained.Moreover the minister stated the Centre's approval for granting a one-time window to government companies to surrender non-operational coal mines without penalty was another achievement of his ministry in the ongoing year.However Joshi expressed concerns over the delays in operationalisation of both coal and mineral blocks due to issues like land acquisition and said there was a need to bring states on board for the same.""I am not talking about any particular state. I don't want to do that because I have to ultimately take state governments into confidence and have to work. But there are some state governments which we are not able to bring on board"" the minister noted.Severe power cuts due to coal shortage in a number of states snowballed into a major political crisis as it came in an election year when two BJP-ruled states Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat -- the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah -- went to polls.Power Minister R K Singh asserted that electricity shortage was primarily happening because states have not paid their dues to Coal India and are unable to lift the allocated dry fuel on time.The states suffered prolonged blackouts as scorching heat waves boosted energy demand at a time when coal stockpiles were low.That sent the officials to the drawing board to rework a coal supply plan to avert future crises. Coal-fired power plants were ordered to use imported fuel to operate at full capacity.Stock norms were also revised. The revised norms mandated coal stock of 17 days at pit head stations and 26 days at non-pit head stations to be maintained by power plants from February to June every year.India is the world's second-largest producer and consumer of coal. Three-quarters of the electricity produced in the country is through coal. India sits atop the world's third-highest reserves of the dry fuel and boasts of the world's largest coal mining company but per person consumption is still modest.India imports a little under a quarter of its consumption -- much of it coking coal which is used in blast furnaces for producing steel and is not available domestically. Yet there are perpetual shortages.In October 2021 India teetered on the brink of a power crisis when stocks at more than half of the country's 135 coal-fired plants ran critically low or below 25 per cent of normal levels.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvaW5kaWEtdGFwcy1vaWwtbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtY29raW5nLWNvYWwtaW4tcnVzc2lhbi1hcmN0aWMtcmVnaW9uL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2Mjg3MzMwLmNtc9IBkAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvaW5kaWEtdGFwcy1vaWwtbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtY29raW5nLWNvYWwtaW4tcnVzc2lhbi1hcmN0aWMtcmVnaW9uL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjI4NzMzMC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India taps oil natural gas coking coal in Russian Arctic region,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvaW5kaWEtdGFwcy1vaWwtbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtY29raW5nLWNvYWwtaW4tcnVzc2lhbi1hcmN0aWMtcmVnaW9uL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2Mjg3MzMwLmNtc9IBkAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvaW5kaWEtdGFwcy1vaWwtbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtY29raW5nLWNvYWwtaW4tcnVzc2lhbi1hcmN0aWMtcmVnaW9uL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjI4NzMzMC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024DFE9662F0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Initially launched in Sindh where 2.25-liter Coca-Cola bottles will be made using food-grade recycled plastic (rPET) the initiative will be rolled out in other provinces as well.

Working closely with Pakistani provincial food authorities Coca-Cola İçecek Pakistan has created a cycle through which used plastic bottles are collected for subjecting into a unit operation. This process ensures thorough cleaning and washing of the plastic while breaking them into small pallets. The pellets are eventually converted into food-grade packaging for Coca-Cola Pakistan

Earlier in 2022 CCI announced its “Sustainability Pledge for 2030”. Under the pledge CCI as a group is taking action to use at least 50 percent recycled plastics in all its packaging. The pledge also aims to evaluate and initiate multiple projects falling under 6 categories including Packaging Water Stewardship Climate Change Human Rights Diversity and Inclusion and Community.

Speaking about this achievement Mr. Ahmet Kursad Ertin GM – CCI Pakistan said “Sustainability is a fundamental and indispensable aspect of our business. It is embedded in our vision and goals. We integrate sustainability principles into all our operations. The use of RPET packaging is a step towards honoring our Packaging related commitment. We are thrilled to incorporate 100% rPET packaging for our products and will continue to take responsibility in line with CCI’s Sustainability Pledge for 2030.”

As part of its World Without Waste vision the Company has committed to using 50% recycled material in its packaging by 2030. Currently the company offers 100% rPET bottles in more than 25 markets.

Fahad Ashraf Vice President of the Coca-Cola Company said “Through this rollout starting in Karachi Company aims to create a looping circular economy where all bottles are made from recycled plastic and are 100 percent recyclable. In doing so we reduce the need for new plastic and cut down the carbon footprint of our operations.”

The introduction of recycled plastic products builds on the work done by Company under its World Without Waste and Water Stewardship initiatives. The company recently marked the first anniversary of Pakistan’s first plastic road in Islamabad – built using 10 tons of plastic waste - introducing the concept of re-carpeting national roads with plastic waste."

The win helped UConn avoid consecutive losses a streak that dates back to March of 1993.

The return of Nika Muhl and Dorka Juhasz helped to bolster the Huskies. Juhasz had 15 points and nine rebounds while Muhl had six points and 12 assists. Their return also provided some breathing room to UConn’s bench which at one point was just two players deep. It was their first game with nine total players in two weeks.

Juhasz also recorded a career-high five blocks. She had been out for the past seven games with a broken thumb.

Aliyah Edwards had a career-high 26 points en route to being named game MVP while Lou Lopez-Senechal added 23 points.

The team was without head coach Geno Auriemma however as Auriemma felt unwell following the team’s shootaround. The team announced he would not be with the team “out of an abundance of caution.”

Florida State made a run in the third quarter putting up 27 points to UConn’s 18. They then pulled within five in the fourth quarter and outscored the Huskies 42-32 in the second half. But it wasn’t enough as UConn had built up an 18-point lead at the half.

The Brazilian who claimed the FIA Formula 2 title in 2022 was the first driver to be brought into the Aston Martin young driver programme earlier this year and he was given his first taste of Formula 1 machinery by the team as well as a free practice outing in Abu Dhabi.

Alongside FIA Formula E champion Stoffel Vandoorne Drugovich will act as part of the reserve driver rota in 2023 but he is keen to not lose his competitive edge by adding a racing programme alongside his Aston Martin duties something the team are also happy for him to do.

“I will be doing the reserve role for Aston Martin I’m going to be following the team and learning as much as I can I’ll do a few FP1s as well that’s something very nice to look forward [to]” Drugovich is quoted as saying by F1i.com during the FIA Gala in Bologna.

“The team is keen to let me do something else which I don’t know yet but we’re trying to see if there is an opportunity to just keep racing but the priority is also going to be Formula 1.”

One series Drugovich will not be competing in is Formula 2 with the rules of the championship preventing champions from returning to the series. However although nothing has been set in stone he hopes to be racing something above where he came from in 2022.

“We have no real direction until now – I’m just hoping I can race something professionally and something that doesn’t really clash with Formula 1” Drugovich added.

“It has to be a programme that doesn’t take too much from my year.

(Image credit: David Bloom)

And boy is there ever something to ponder for the cable TV business: Will 2023 be the year the industry finally decides that providing cable TV is something someone else should worry about?

The coming year may be the first where a major cable TV provider stops selling um cable TV. Most such companies have been evolving away from the original basis of their business for years especially by selling the fastest and highest-bandwidth broadband out there for home and business use.

But should a major provider like Comcast or Charter take the step of dropping cable TV it would be a landmark in the industry’s history and almost certainly won’t be the only such decision to come. And that has implications for the broadcast and basic-cable networks that will lose a source of revenue and reach even as they navigate a difficult transition to streaming.

Also read: Is Comcast Finally Giving Up on Pay TV by Putting NBC Affiliates on Peacock?

We’re already seeing hints that to paraphrase one of the industry’s biggest-ever hits Cable Winter Is Coming.

Comcast the nation’s biggest cable company reported that it had lost nearly 10% of its cable TV customers over the past year. The company has had more broadband than cable subscribers for years but that’s only accelerating. In Q3 the company said it had signed up a record number of broadband customers.

Comcast has committed to spend more than $200 for each passing in its footprint to upgrade its network to multi-gigabit speeds by 2025.

Comcast which more than most providers made early and active peace with the Netflixes of the world is probably the least likely candidate to drop cable TV anytime soon though. Its entertainment holdings include NBC CNBC MSNBC and a batch of other basic-cable networks. Its vertically integrated approach is a key tenet of Brian Roberts’s pitch to investors.

In fact if I’m making 2023 predictions for Comcast Roberts is more likely to double down on that content-pipe twin play perhaps finally persuading Shari Redstone to sell all or parts of Paramount Global. I say parts because the two companies’ respective ownership of CBS and NBC won’t fly under FCC regulations. That becomes a divestiture-based buying opportunity for private equity or maybe Warner Bros. Discovery.

But Comcast is not alone in the cord-cutting with other providers far less invested on the content side.

Already market penetration rates for the entire industry have plummeted from nearly 90% of U.S. households to just 66% easily the lowest level in more than a decade and down 5 percentage points in just a year.

That total looks better than it is thanks to the virtual MVPDs (Alphabet’s YouTube TV Disney-controlled Hulu Plus Live Fubo Philo etc.) plus what’s left of the satellite TV business. A Horowitz Research year-end report suggests just 51% of U.S. video-content customers get their TV fix through a traditional cable provider. Two years ago that number was 81%.

Survey after survey suggests plenty more subscribers will be joining the cord-cutting cascade in coming months as they get more comfortable navigating connected TVs and streaming apps in the post-lockdown era.

Earlier this year SparkLight (formerly Cable One) said it would stop providing bulk cable services to apartment buildings hotels and similar venues. Getting out of the industry lets Cable One upgrade its high-speed data capabilities while sparing it the “time and energy spent focusing on an unprofitable product offering.” Ouch.

And 2022 was the year that affiliate fee revenue finally dropped industrywide. For years even as the customer base eroded carriage and retransmission fees kept rising keeping total revenue growth on the plus side. No more. Now the total is down despite more fee hikes in the face of a fading economy and softening ad market.

None of this is to say traditional cable TV disappears completely certainly not in 2023. Older media platforms have a way of not going away. AOL still exists. My 81-year-old mother last I checked still gets DVDs from Netflix. She still uses AM radio for goodness sake. And DirecTV too more or less.

There’s still a profitable if sharply declining business serving those tens of millions of customers who still love the best of cable TV: convenience a broad mix of programming a single bill and a customer-service provider you can (eventually) reach on the phone. Private equity certainly will take advantage of the change to buy up distressed assets that it can aggregate and milk for revenue until the bitter end.

And of course the decision of traditional wired cable TV providers to be other things is really about them heading to the parts of their business that are higher margin with longer-term growth prospects.

If they ditch cable TV the companies will still make money off broadband carrying everyone’s streaming apps without the customer service and equipment headaches that providing video service entails.

Comcast Charter Spectrum and other “cable” companies also have found a highly profitable niche selling bargain-priced mobile wireless services that undercut the big carriers. Dish Network’s Charlie Ergen looks pretty smart for his hard pivot into mobile over these past few years even if the transition has been slow.

And there’s the whole smart-home revolution which should accelerate now that Apple Amazon Samsung and Google have gotten behind the Matter standard.

Consumers want to get into automated and remote-controlled home security lighting door locks heating/cooling and other services. But they need a capable pipe reasonable price and help integrating it all. Matter matters and the broadband providers have the customer relationships in-home networking expertise and promotional reach to take advantage.

With all those other ways to make money it may be time to simplify some business models. Let YouTube TV et al deal with never-happy customers regulatory headaches and entitled media companies and broadcasters expecting endless annual fee hikes.

Soon enough some cable TV company will say “enough” and transition to becoming “just"" a broadband/mobile/smart home services company. Who’s it going to be? Maybe we should start a dead pool. Any bets on your end?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbm5saXZlLmNvbS9saWZlLzIwMjIvMTIvd2hhdC1jaGFubmVsLWlzLTE5MjMtb24taG93LXRvLXN0cmVhbS15ZWxsb3dzdG9uZS1wcmVxdWVsLTEyMTgyMi5odG1s0gF6aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVubmxpdmUuY29tL2xpZmUvMjAyMi8xMi93aGF0LWNoYW5uZWwtaXMtMTkyMy1vbi1ob3ctdG8tc3RyZWFtLXllbGxvd3N0b25lLXByZXF1ZWwtMTIxODIyLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What channel is ‘1923′ on?

To skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the 5 Most Diverse Companies in the US.

Amid a growing pressure from investors and convincing evidence of economic benefits companies have started to take ESG (environmental social and governance) principles very seriously. Over the past few years we have seen a dramatic rise in activist investors pushing major companies to follow ESG practices. Studies also show that ESG is directly linked to economic benefits. For example a study by Moore Global which included 1262 large companies from eight major economies found that companies that took ESG seriously saw their revenue grow twice the rate of those that are not as committed to ESG. The study also found that profits for companies that stick to ESG principles rose three times faster than those less keen on ESG. The study also said that about 83% of companies invested in ESG reported improved customer retention while 84% reported that ESG practices improved their ability to attract external investment.

Investors are also flocking to companies with strong ESG practices because there’s real money to be made in ESG investing. A 2019 report by McKinsey showed that global sustainable investing topped $30 trillion a whopping 68% rise from 2014. The climate change problem and increasing awareness about human rights would only increase opportunities in the ESG space.

The importance of ESG in investing space can be gauged from the fact that the US government is initiating several actions to enforce companies to stick to ESG rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission is working to develop a common benchmark on how sustainable products are assessed and reported. However such practices also resulted in a backlash from several companies.

Data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows that global ESG assets are expected to surpass a whopping $50 trillion by 2025.

To rank the most diverse companies in the U.S. we considered rankings by major publications including Forbes Fortune Vervoe and Diversity Inc. If a company was included in multiple lists it was ranked higher. We also considered the ranking to each company given by each list.

Over the course of the week HE Sheikha Hind watched performances such as Rumi: The Musical and The Journey of Ibn Battuta detailing the adventures of the famous Arab explorer as well as toured the QF festival’s various zones.

This year the zones included “D’reesha of Invention” which integrated science and performing arts and was sponsored by ConocoPhillips Qatar and Al Khater House and housed a variety of cultural performances workshops and activities.

An area dedicated to art and music allowed visitors to try different instruments as well as paint sculpt and act while the Torba Farmers Market offered a range of local produce from homegrown businesses.

The final day of the festival featured an Arabic Poetry Night where a number of Arab poets shared works focusing on important issues facing the region.

The event welcomed Rawda al-Hajj whos regarded as one of the Arab world’s most famous poets Kuwaiti poet Dalal al-Baroud Syrian poet and writer Anas AlDoghem and Jassim bin Mohamed al-Sahih a poet from Saudi Arabia.

The D’reesha Performing Arts Festival was held in collaboration with principal partners ConocoPhillips Qatar and the Social & Sport Contribution Fund.

Strategic partners are the Ministry of Culture the Ministry of Social Development and Family the Doha Film Institute Torba Farmers Market Woqod and Dukhan Bank.

“Woqod sees D’reesha Performing Arts Festival as an opportunity to educate a global audience during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 about regional and Arabic traditions” said Woqod managing director & chief executive Saad Rashid al-Muhannadi. “We are pleased to assist the QF in its role as a cultural authority in advancing Arabic culture.”

Ahmed al-Meer who visited the festival with his three children said: “Although the festival coincides with the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 with many football-related activities are taking place across Doha D’reesha Performing Arts Festival is considered the best for families.”

“This is because it provides an educational and cultural experience and it is also a lot of fun for children and parents” he explained. “This is what encouraged us to visit multiple times.”

“We’ve had a great time and the children learned a lot about our customs and Islamic history” al-Meer added. “We want to thank Qatar Foundation for organising such a unique event.”

Nine-year-old Reem al-Enezi spent a full afternoon at Oxygen Park where she participated in many activities.

“I enjoyed everything – drawing painting and reading stories” she said. “I also wore Qatari clothes and took beautiful pictures. I love this place and I want to come back.”

Studio 5/6 was one of the entities participating in the “D'reesha of Invention” zone and through workshops it introduced students to robotics programming as well as different Arab scientists.

“One of the activities that we offered was allowing young students and their parents to take pictures with our camera and then putting all these pictures together to build a bigger image of an Arab scientist” said Studio 5/6 project manager Sabine al-Kahi. “It was a great way to encourage students to guess and research Arab scientists.”

Currently Jupiter lies within the constellation’s borders and will remain there until mid-May 2023.

Pisces has the nickname of first constellation of the zodiac because the sun appears in front of this constellation during the March equinox. With this in mind one tropical year is usually defined as the period of time between successive March equinoxes. So – in this sense – the March equinox marks the beginning of a new year. Also that is why Pisces often appears as marking the starting point of the zodiac.

Generally the best time to view constellations in the night sky is when they’re opposite the sun in the sky. They rise at sunset and are up all night. So if the sun is in Pisces in March then the opposite side of the calendar October and the following months is a good time for observing Pisces. Indeed in December by the time the sky is dark Pisces is already high in the southern sky for us in the Northern Hemisphere. Pisces is at its highest for the evening at about 8 p.m. local time in December.

How to find Pisces

Indeed you need a dark country sky to see this fairly dim constellation swimming in what the early stargazers considered to be a watery region of the lore-laden heavens. Pisces is northeast of the constellation Aquarius the Water Bearer and to the northwest of the constellation Cetus the Whale.

Fortunately you can find Pisces rather handily by referring to the signpost known as the Great Square of Pegasus. Look first for the Circlet of Pisces – otherwise known as the head of the Western Fish – to the south of the Square of Pegasus. Once you’ve found the Western Fish go on from there to catch the Eastern Fish that’s jumping upward to the east of the Square of Pegasus. As seen from the northern tropics or the Southern Hemisphere the Eastern Fish appears to be plunging downward. The entire constellation looks like the letter V and a very graceful and lovely V at that.

The stars of the Fish

Pisces has few bright stars. The stars most people focus on are the ones that create the Circlet of Pisces. The brightest star here is the 3.7-magnitude Gamma Piscium. Moving counterclockwise around the circle we next find Theta Piscium at magnitude 4.2. Then comes Iota Piscium at magnitude 4.1. Lastly is Lambda Piscium at magnitude 4.5. These stars are too dim to see from a light-polluted city.

Marking the bottom of the V-shape where the tails of the fish come together is a magnitude-3.8 star named Alrisha or Alpha Piscium. Fourteen degrees northwest is magnitude 3.6 Eta Piscium the constellation’s brightest star. (Halfway in between is magnitude 4.2 Omicron Piscium.) Just over one degree east from Eta Piscium is the one Messier object in Pisces.

The lone Messier object

Pisces can only claim one Messier object – that is a fuzzy object resembling a comet but really a star cluster nebula or galaxy – within its borders. It’s Messier 74 (M74) a face-on spiral galaxy looming at an estimated 35 million light-years distant.

In the month of March when it’s technically possible to see all the Messier objects in the span of one night during a Messier marathon this Messier object in the constellation Pisces is one that is commonly missed.

That’s because at that time of year M74 lurks rather low in the western sky at nightfall and quickly sinks out of view shortly thereafter. Plus this distant galaxy has an extremely low surface brightness so excellent seeing conditions are absolutely critical for catching it. You don’t need a large telescope as much as you need a dark transparent sky.

Try spotting it this December using averted vision on a dark clear moonless night.

Pisces in mythology and star lore

Greek and Roman versions of Pisces’ sky lore seemed to have come from Syria where fish were regarded as divine. There seems to be some confusion as to whether the ancient Syrians abstained from fish altogether or only fish from the Chalos River (presently called the Queiq or Aleppo River).

The Syrian goddess of love and fertility Atagartis is often portrayed as half woman and half fish. She is thought to be the origin of the Greek goddess Aphrodite and the Roman goddess Venus.

According to Greek mythology the fire-breathing monster Typhon was about to devour Aphrodite (the Roman Venus) and her son Eros (the Roman Cupid) so they turned into fish and jumped into the Euphrates River to make a great escape. Mother and son tied themselves together with a cord to make sure they would not lose one another in the tumbling waters.

How long is the Age of Pisces?

By some definitions we’ll continue to live within the Age of Pisces as long the sun shines in front of this constellation on the March equinox. By the way although the sun hasn’t appeared in front of the constellation Aries on the equinox for over 2000 years we still refer to the March equinox point as the First Point in Aries.

If we accept the constellation boundaries as defined by the International Astronomical Union the Age of Pisces started in 68 BCE and the Age of Aquarius will begin in 2597.

But there are many varied views on this some of which you can read about in this post: When does the Age of Aquarius begin?

Bottom line: Pisces the Fish is a zodiac constellation that is high in the sky on December evenings. Look for it and its asterism the Circlet of Pisces.

The first two Boeing [NYSE:BA]-built O3b mPOWER satellites are sending and receiving signals as they continue their journey into Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) following their successful dual-configuration launch.

Developed for service provider SES the satellites lifted off atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Dec. 16 at 5:48 PM ET.

O3b mPOWER is SES’s second-generation MEO system designed to transform industries with terabit-level scale roundtrip latency of less than 150 milliseconds and unmatched service availability.

“Today’s launch marks the next milestone of our MEO journey. With O3b mPOWER we are bringing game-changing technology to deliver a unique combination of high-throughput guaranteed reliability and service flexibility that is the first in the industry” said Steve Collar chief executive officer SES. “O3b mPOWER is the satellite system of choice for applications where performance matters most.”

The O3b mPOWER ecosystem comprises an initial 11 satellites each equipped with more than 5000 digitally formed beams. Coupled with an extensive ground infrastructure the software-driven system enables SES to address current and future connectivity needs for governments mobile network operators energy companies cruise lines and enterprises across the globe.

Boeing will oversee the satellites’ orbit raising and in-orbit testing before handover to SES in approximately 5 months.

“From concept to reality the partnership with SES while developing the first-of-its-kind technology has been remarkable” said Jim Chilton senior vice president of Boeing Space and Launch. “The next few months will be another critical collaboration period as we prepare the next nine satellites for launch and enable these first satellites to fulfill their mission to connect people around the world.”

The O3b mPOWER satellite constellation will kick off commercial service in the third quarter of 2023.

For more information on how O3b mPOWER can bring a new level of performance to satellite-enabled communications visit SES’s newsroom.

Whether it's the Cullinan SUV the Phantom sedan or even the Dawn convertible all of these models turn heads when they hit the road.

If bought brand-new their prices exceed the buying power of many people on regular salaries but what if someone is willing to shell out just $30000 for a Rolls? Lo and behold I found the perfect deal on Copart except the car had a mishap. Unfortunately the front end was so badly damaged in the impact that even the statue that once sat majestically on the hood is gone. And yet here's proof that Rolls-Royce doesn't come cheap even after a crash.The Rolls-Royce model you see here featured a 6.6-liter V12 gasoline engine and produced 571 ps (563 hp) and 575 pound-feet (820 Nm) of torque. The 0-62 mph (0-100 kph) sprint took exactly 5 seconds and the top speed was 155 mph (249 kph). The mill sent its power to the rear wheels via an 8-speed automatic gearbox.For the time being though the prospective future owner can only dream of that performance because the car has quite a lot to recover . If the buyer wants to get this white Rolls-Royce Down convertible back on the road they will have to focus on repairs to the front end where the impact was very hard affecting the left wheel to the point where it was detached. There are dents on all sides and the interior looks just as damaged as the exterior.The Rolls-Royce Dawn was launched in 2016 as a convertible in the Ghost/Wraith family. Although it is a two-door car the model retains elegance and comfort for four passengers. The Dawn was the third convertible launched by Rolls Royce in the last 50 years and is based on the 1952 Silverdawn model. In 2016 a Dawn Cabriolet was priced at over $400000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3BvcnNjaGUtaGFja2luZy0xMDEtd2l0aC1qci1nYXJhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Porsche Hacking 101 With JR Garage,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3BvcnNjaGUtaGFja2luZy0xMDEtd2l0aC1qci1nYXJhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

In the men's snowboard big air Marcus Kleveland of Norway rallied for victory with two big final runs scoring a 184.25 to win comfortably over American Chris Corning who could not deliver as the final competitor of the day.

Corning finished with a 172.50 while Ian Matteoli of Italy was third with a 160.00.

Corning led going into the final run but Kleveland had notched a 93.25 in run two and backed that up with a 91.00 on his third and final run making him the only man to go 90 points-plus twice on the day.

It's a seventh World Cup title for Kleveland 23 who is also a two-time Olympian at PyeongChang 2018 and Beijing 2022.

A special prize went to the biggest run of the day for both the men and women with Matteoli claiming that with a 94.75 on his second run. American Julia Marino got that honour on the women's side with a 91.75.

On Friday (16 December) Olympic medallists Scotty James and Queralt Castellet each claimed their seventh career World Cup in the snowboard halfpipe event.

None of the six medal winners from Beijing - including Olympic champions Anna Gasser and Su Yiming - were in action in Copper Mountain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3bnl0di5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8xOC9mcmVkZXJpY2stZi1iZWNrLTgzLWx5b25zLWZhbGxzL9IBUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3bnl0di5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8xOC9mcmVkZXJpY2stZi1iZWNrLTgzLWx5b25zLWZhbGxzLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frederick F.

Warehouse retail giant Costco plans to create a new store in northeast Anchorage at a competitor’s former location according to records filed with the municipality

The $5.1 million project calls for Costco to renovate the former Sam’s Club in the Tikahtnu Commons mall at 1074 N. Muldoon Road north of the Glenn Highway according to city records.

Project officials are seeking a municipal permit to renovate the building and create a Costco Business Center according to Gretchen Stuller permit management supervisor for Anchorage.

Plans will “reorient and add parking spaces add landscape islands building additions and repainting and building facade updates” Craig Lyon municipal planning director said in a staff report about the project in November. “These amendments to the overall site plan are small and do not substantially change the function of the commercial shopping center.”

Costco based in Washington state operates four warehouse stores in Alaska and several hundred nationally. Anchorage has two. Juneau and Fairbanks have one.

A Costco Business Center is different from a warehouse store according to the company’s website.

Costco operates more than 15 business centers in the U.S. the site says. They are available for any member but cater to small businesses. They offer additional items not found at warehouses. They open earlier at 7 a.m. instead of 10 a.m. But they’re closed on Sundays.

Contractors who are involved in the project declined to comment. They referred questions to Costco officials who did not return calls.

The proposed Anchorage store is not listed among the “coming soon” Costco stores set to open within the next four months according to Costco’s website. An online Costco form for media inquiries went unanswered as of early Friday but the site included this statement: “We cannot comment on locations that will be opening more than three months from today.”

The municipality has issued an interior demolition permit for the project Stuller said. The permit allows work to begin at the site she said.

On Thursday afternoon the building was closed and appeared empty with no activity underway.

The lot is about 650000 square feet similar in size to the Costco off DeBarr Road and smaller than the Costco off Dimond Boulevard.

Alaska’s three Sam’s Club locations closed in 2018 after parent company Walmart Inc. announced it was shutting down about 60 warehouses across the U.S.

Walmart’s decision was based on the company’s need to better align Sam’s Club business strategy with its locations according to reports at the time. In Alaska the higher cost of doing business in a remote state was also named as a factor.

The Tikahtnu Commons center including the building that housed the Sam’s Club is owned by North Anchorage Real Estate Investors.

The company consists of Browman Development Company in California and CIRI the Alaska Native regional corporation in much of Southcentral Alaska.

The building owners did not provide comment as of Friday morning.

Francis McLaughlin senior planner with the municipality said Costco plans to enter into a lease agreement with the owners for the property.

After Sam’s Club closed its Alaska stores the empty building earlier in the pandemic served as an emergency food distribution site run by the Food Bank of Alaska following a donation from Walmart for the building’s use.

Costco Wholesale (COST 1.05%) is one of the world's most successful retailers today. The king of warehouse retailing has defied the odds in many respects. It delivers sales growth in nearly every economic environment and internationally and it has successfully adapted to local cultures in markets where many Americentric retail models have failed.

So successful is its business model that investors have come to expect robust earnings reports from Costco which has probably helped lead to a consistently high P/E ratio. The question for investors is whether the retail stock can still justify its expense.

Just how expensive is Costco?

Costco shares currently trade for around 35 times earnings. This may seem expensive given that Target Dollar General and Dollar Tree trade at lower P/E ratios. Only Amazon and Sam's Club parent Walmart are more expensive though Walmart has historically sold at a lower multiple than Costco.

Costco has not always maintained such a high P/E ratio. It traded under 30 times earnings for most of the 2010s and even fell to a multiple of 15 during the 2008-09 financial crisis. That marks a stark change from the 2020s when Costco has maintained a P/E ratio above 30 even during the March 2020 bear market.

That valuation has caused many to deem this stock expensive and one of those investors is likely Warren Buffett. His company Berkshire Hathaway owned Costco for more than 20 years.

But in late 2020 Berkshire's Q3 13-F revealed that the company had sold the entire Costco position more than 4.3 million shares despite Charlie Munger's longtime position on Costco's board of directors. At the time the stock had typically traded for over 40 times earnings.

Does its growth justify its valuation?

The financials have likely helped propel the valuation higher but the business is slowing down compared to fiscal 2022. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Nov. 20) net sales rose 8% year over year to $54 billion. Costco's $1.3 billion in net income grew by only 3% during that time as increasing costs wiped out most of the revenue gains.

During fiscal 2022 (ended Aug. 28) revenue of $227 billion amounted to yearly growth of 16%. Also the $5.8 billion in net income surged 17% higher over the same period.

At that time Costco's P/E ratio stayed consistently above 40 and peaked at 49 indicating that investors were pricing that growth into the stock. Moreover Costco stock reached its all-time high peaking in April of this year at more than $612 per share. The stock has since fallen by almost one-fourth.

Is Costco too expensive?

Investors can probably find more reasonably priced retail stocks than Costco even on a relative basis. Indeed Costco is a notable retail success story having mastered the art of steady growth under various conditions. The company has shown no apparent signs that that will change.

However retail investors can find similar growth stories in other companies stocks they can most likely buy more cheaply. And with Buffett having sold his stake in Costco investors may be more inclined to follow his lead than add shares.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5bWVhbC5jb20vMTE0MTM2MS90aWt0b2staXMtdG9ybi1vdmVyLWNvc3Rjb3Mtc3VzaGktb2ZmZXJpbmdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TikTok Is Torn Over Costco's Sushi Offerings,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thedailymeal.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /1141361/tiktok-is-torn-over-costcos-sushi-offerings/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024DFE568DF0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5bWVhbC5jb20vMTE0MTM2MS90aWt0b2staXMtdG9ybi1vdmVyLWNvc3Rjb3Mtc3VzaGktb2ZmZXJpbmdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzE4L2lzLWNvc3Rjby1hLWJ1eS1oZWFkaW5nLWludG8tMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Costco a Buy Heading Into 2023?,"The stock has outperformed during the pandemic but there's one reason to be wary.

Costco Wholesale (COST 1.05%) has long been an investor favorite.

The retailer has an easy-to-understand business model a clear economic moat and a track record of success.

The warehouse retailer has also been a strong performer during the pandemic as it drew customers to its cavernous warehouses early in the lockdown era and has delivered strong results through much of this year as well.

However Costco shares have slumped since the company issued a disappointing monthly sales report for November and its year-to-date performance only just matches the S&P 500 index now.

Is Costco a buy heading into 2023? Let's take a look at where the company stands today and what investors should expect next year.

Costco today: Reliable results but signs of vulnerability

In its recently released fiscal first-quarter earnings report Costco reported comparable sales growth of 7.1% adjusted for fuel and constant currency and a modest increase in earnings per share from $2.98 to $3.07.

Many of Costco's peers especially in the discretionary retail sector are struggling facing higher inflation and a shift in consumer spending away from goods and toward services like restaurants and travel that consumers didn't get to spend on during the pandemic.

Costco also has an advantage over the retail sector because its membership model insulates it from fluctuations in its retail business. In fact Costco makes most of its profits from its membership income bringing in $1 billion in profit in its most recent quarter or 73% of total net income.

Membership trends at the company remain strong as well as it said on the earnings call. Renewal rates clocked in at 92.5% in North America or 90.4% globally. Paid membership increased 7% over the last year showing steady growth in customers and the company saw faster growth in executive members who pay double the fee and save an extra 2% when they shop at Costco.

The company also hinted on the earnings call that it was likely to raise membership fees which it has historically done every five years by $5.

What to expect in 2023

2023 is still a couple of weeks away but the new year looks set to get off to an inauspicious start for retailers like Costco.

November retail sales fell more than expected down 0.6% from October and a number of retailers have said that consumer spending noticeably slowed through October and November.

Those headwinds are also starting to show up in Costco's own results as adjusted comparable sales rose 5.3% in November. While that might sound good it's down from Costco's earlier comparable sales growth and also below year-over-year inflation at 7.1% which could signal some margin compression as Costco is likely paying more for the goods it sells.

With falling retail sales the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate hike and ample evidence that consumer demand is slowing 2023 is shaping up to be a tough year for retailers as the economy could sink into a recession.

While the company has some recession-proof characteristics including its membership model and rock-bottom prices the stock's recent slide shows that investors seem to be fearful of a recession.

Costco's biggest risk

Going into a potential recession Costco's biggest risk isn't a problem with the business but a problem with the stock's valuation.

At a price-to-earnings ratio of 35 Costco is more expensive than nearly every other brick-and-mortar retailer and its slowing growth doesn't bode well for its premium valuation.

If performance continues to weaken Costco's multiple is likely to compress and the stock could fall another 20% and still be considered expensive.

The settlement price tag exceeds the largest fine possible said Attorney General Josh Shapiro following the hearing.

Charges were filed against the company in June 2020 by the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General prior to Cabot’s merger with Cimarex to form the new energy company. Coterra spokesman George Stark said settlement negotiations began over one year ago.

The main courtroom in the Susquehanna County Courthouse was filled by about 50 people – some residents in the affected area as well as anti-drilling activists.

Two of the affected residents took the stand on Tuesday.

Ray Kemble a vocal anti-drilling activist – said he felt “vindicated for talking the truth.”

Nolen Scott Ely said that since 2008 he had pursued many avenues to “make right the wrongs done in this area.”

He also spoke of the significant impact his family has felt in those years with water issues occurring since before his children were in kindergarten – until now as they head off to college. “They have never known a safe water source” he said.

Ely said he hoped the drilling company has improved the process and “understand that they destroyed homed and families.”

“This is not a day of vindication” Ely said. “It is a day of replacement.”

Susquehanna County President Judge Legg presided over the no contest plea deal with the following agreed upon details:

* Coterra will pay the mandatory $2500 fine to the Clean Water fund.

* Details of the $16.29 million water well and distribution system – to be operated by Pennsylvania American Water Company (PAWC) – were also put on the record. The funds will be placed into an interest-bearing account in the Office of the Attorney General.

* Each property will have a $50000 credit for the water – which is expected to cover the utility bills for about 75 years.

* While the water well/distribution system is being constructed Coterra will install operate and maintain water treatments systems.

*And if the water system is unable to be completed Coterra will maintain the water treatment systems for 30 years.

*If a property owner does not accept the treatment system or community water Coterra’s obligation will be deemed as satisfied.

The agreement follows the property and not the current landowners.

In a press conference following the hearing Shapiro said ““Residents of Dimock have waited far too long for the clean water Pennsylvania’s Constitution is supposed to guarantee all of us.”

Coterra Energy released a statement following the court appearance: “Coterra has worked closely with the Office of Attorney General to resolve historical matters and create a path forward for all parties. As out operations today showcase Coterra strives to follow best practices exceed industry standards and to continue to be a valuable community partner. We are committed to being a responsible steward of the Commonwealth’s natural resources and will continue to work closely with our landowners and community leaders.”

“This agreement brings justice to the residents of Dimock who for years had been ignored” said Shapiro. “People across the country remember what happened here in Dimock and now they will know the rule of law won the day. Companies will take notice that we won’t allow communities like this to be taken advantage of or forgotten.”

In his statement Shapiro said the agreement is the result of a thorough investigation and evaluation by independent experts to “sample and analyze the water contamination and develop and engineering plan that would best serve the needs of the residents of Dimock.”

PAWC will oversee the construction and operation of the water line. Construction is expected to take three to four years.

Dimock resident Victoria Switzer also spoke at the press conference. She said that up until the resolution residents had been failed at every level – from local state representatives to the Dept. of Environmental Protection and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Although Switzer did not get to hear the drilling company deliver a guilty plea she said “I think $16 million is a good indicator of guilt.”

The resolution Swtizer said is the best scenario for residents. “The Attorney General got it done and I am grateful.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

HISTORY] 'Under the Queen's Umbrella' faces questions about Chinese influences,"



[FICTION VS. HISTORY] 'Under the Queen’s Umbrella' faces questions about Chinese influences

“Under the Queen’s Umbrella” featuring veteran actor Kim Hye-soo recently wrapped 16 episodes on tvN with a high viewership rating of 16.9 percent. It was also streamed on Netflix where it remained on the streaming platform’s Global Top 10 chart in the non-English TV category until it came to an end early this month.Like most Korean historical drama series “Under the Queen’s Umbrella” which is set in some fictional period within Korea's Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) starts off with a notification that reads “All characters locations organizations and events in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.” Other than the setting — the Joseon Dynasty — the story is almost entirely fictitious as none of the characters are based on real figures that existed in Korean history.Most Korean viewers familiar with the rules and regulations of Joseon’s royal palace would’ve also assumed that the drama would have more fiction than fact as its teaser showed Kim playing lead character Queen Hwa-ryeong literally running after her trouble-making sons inside the palace grounds which would’ve been impossible in reality. A queen would always have to walk slowly and elegantly.The drama has a unique and satirical story that revolves around Kim who rolls up her(traditional Korean dress) sleeves and chases around the palace grounds for the sake of her sons — a portrayal of a Joseon queen that has not been seen in other historical drama series. Such storytelling has been pointed out as one of the contributors to its high viewership rating. The confrontation between Kim Hye-soo the queen and Kim Hye-sook who plays her mother-in-law Queen Dowager won sympathy from many female viewers. The fiercely competitive concubines who were willing to do whatever it took to ensure their sons became the next heir like secretly hiring private tutors satirizes Korean society's educational fervor and tiger moms.Though it was clear the drama is fictitious the series still could not avoid criticisms regarding factual inaccuracies that most historical dramas or films face. The criticism began right after episode 2 when simplified Chinese characters showed up in the subtitles to explain the phrase “mul gwi won ju” which roughly translates to ""missing or stolen objects gradually come back to their owner."" It should've used which was what the characters were actually using during the Joseon Dynasty.Viewers quickly took their anger to online communities and demanded tvN issue an explanation. The producers of the series quickly apologized and corrected the subtitles saying it was a mistake. However some historians insisted that the expression ""mul gwi won ju"" itself is Chinese and that it would have never been used during Joseon. Making matters worse an incorrect signboard referring to a Joseon king's bedroom chamber appeared in the drama's fifth episode leaving viewers questioning the true intention behind the creation of the drama series and whether or not there was any Chinese influence.In episode 5 Kim Hye-soo visits the king in his bedroom chamber. In the scene a signboard appears on the building of the bedroom chamber that reads “Taehwajeon” in Chinese characters. However bedroom chambers for the kings of the Joseon Dynasty were either Gangnyeongjeon in Gyeongbok Palace Daejojeon in Changdeok Palace Suryeongjeon in Changdeok Palace or Hamnyeongjeon in Deoksu Palace.The Chinese characters Taehwajeon on the other hand are used for the Chinese name of the Hall of Supreme Harmony the largest hall within the Forbidden City in Beijing China. It was where the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties of China hosted their enthronements and wedding ceremonies. The filming location of the “Queen Under the Umbrella” was a site in Mungyeong City in North Gyeongsang which is frequently used as the backdrop for many of Korea’s historical dramas. Netizens pointed out that the original signboard at the filming site for the bedroom chamber reads Gangnyeongjeon and argued that the fact ""Under the Queen's Umbrella"" producers changed the signboard ""clearly shows there's Chinese influence.""More trouble stemmed from the same episode when Kim calls herself “bongung” in front of the Chief State Councilor while she yells at him to be quiet. According to Korean historians a royal queen of Joseon never referred herself as “bongung” but as “socheop” or “shincheop.”is a word frequently heard in Chinese historical dramas and is one of the words used by a queen when she refers to herself.Some historians pointed out that the entire concept was unrealistic as princes would never compete for the throne in Joseon as it was a society that was strictly based on direct blood heritage. Korean historian Jeon Woo-yong says that while princes of the Joseon Dynasty never competed for the throne as depicted in the series it did happen in Chinese history where eight princes fought for the throne at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty.Culture critic Jeong Deok-hyun says that it is difficult to criticize the drama for “history distortion” as it is indeed a “fantasy” and a “fictional drama.”“But since it uses Joseon as its setting it should’ve gone through a thorough historical research” said Jeong adding that Korean viewers are bound to be particularly sensitive to such Chinese influences in Korean content especially at a time when anti-Chinese sentiment among Koreans is so high following China’s persistent claims over some of Korea’s cultural heritage like hanbok and kimchi.“Even though it’s fiction that has nothing to do with actual history if the historical drama uses the time and space of Joseon at least its lifestyle social status system customs and culture should be correctly portrayed as that of Joseon” said Jeong. “If it’s done loosely it becomes subject to criticism. If it reminds the viewers of Chinese culture the criticism will become full-blown.”The Joseon Dynasty setting plays a big part in the narrative of the series. The conflict between the king and his servants the queen and other concubines the crown prince and the rest of the princes only make sense with Joseon’s hierarchy system. The drama includes several methods that were really used by the palace for the crown prince to help him study better such as dipping his face under salt water for more than 150 seconds at dawn for better concentration or making him drink water that has been boiled over 100 times so he would live longer.“Historical dramas will always be at the crossroads — whether to follow the history strictly or to be entirely fictitious and set in a fictional time and space. That is the only way to avoid unnecessary criticism” said Jeong.Park Ba-ra the writer and creator of the series responded to the backlash after the drama came to an end on Dec. 9. She posted on the series website saying that she’s looked through “countless journals historical documents and books to write one line after another” and that she was especially careful to portray hanbok(a Korean traditional hairpin) and Korean food and dishes of Joseon properly.Park also added that she and the producers “consulted with an expert from the early stages of script writing on all the names and expressions used in the drama” explaining that they didn’t expect to be embroiled in such criticism.However Park said it is also difficult for a writer to work on something creative and be imaginative if the writer is “under strict historical standards” as it might “limit creativity.”“I will try my best to create an environment where more writers can take a stab at the fusion period genre and create such series” she added.BY YIM SEUNG-HYE [yim.seunghye@joongang.co.kr]",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bGF1bmNoZXMuY29tL2NlbGVicml0aWVzL2x1eHVyaW91cy1saWZlc3R5bGUtb2Ytc2F1ZGktcHJpbmNlLW1icy5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,His vacation home is a $300 million French chateau and his yacht has a $450 million Da Vinci painting - MBS the 37 ...,"

Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud colloquially known by his initials MBS is the Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. The 1985-born young leader is also the face of the highly affluent House of Saud and the personification of the wave of advancement out-of-the-box thinking and larger-than-life ambition. Of course the unending royal pits of wealth are motivation enough to plan a new avant-garde Saudi Arabia in a fashion considered too expensive to even dream of but that’s precisely what defines MBS. Coming from the lap of luxury the man has the stomach to do the unthinkable think in trillions and spend with equal gusto. The young and steadfast voice and vision of the House of Saud paint a masterpiece of opulence underlining the difference between being rich and kingly. Meet magnanimous living high-mindedness and umpteen royal riches through MBS’s elephantine life-





The Crown Prince’s French chateau is one of the most expensive residences worldwide-

The Chateau Louis XIV in Louveciennes outside Paris is easily among the world’s most expensive homes. Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud purchased the lavish $300 million property in 2015. The Chateau Louis XIV was developed by Emad Khashoggi who courageously bulldozed the original 19th-century structure to revamp it with 21st-century amenities.



The overhaul was as opulent as hi-tech; the fountains sound systems lights and air conditioning were all iPhone-controlled. The avant-garde castle sits on a 57-acre area comprising 10 bedrooms a colossal reception a private cinema a squash court two ballrooms and a nightclub.



Bin Salman’s luxury abode also houses an astonishing aquarium one indoor one outdoor pool a library and a wine cellar that can store up to 3000 bottles.



No wonder Kim Kardashian wanted to marry her then knight-in-shining-armor Kanye West in the no-expense-spared estate.



His $400 million Serene yacht is a palace of the high seas-

2022 has revealed the riches of billionaires worldwide (read: Russia). The most special possessions out of the lot have certainly been superyachts. When talking about the top ten most lavish luxury vessels in the world the highest ranks belong to royals. MBS’s Serene megayacht features among the ten largest yachts in the world with an overall length of 439 ft.



The $400 million floating palace is so grand even Microsoft tycoon Bill Gates chartered her. Fincantieri’s creation boasts seven decks and 4500 square meters of interior space designed by Reymond Langton Design.



The vessel includes a palatial owner’s suite comprising a stately double cabin with a private swim platform and private lift. Luxe amenities onboard include a gigantic internal seawater pool two helipads a nightclub a snow room several children’s playrooms a climbing wall between the decks’ slides and an underwater viewing room.



Adults can unwind in the fantastic wellness and beauty center with spas hammams and more. 12 elegant cabins accommodate 24 guests.



MBS travels in style and owns a fleet of private jets –

The youngest defense minister in the world enjoyed complete access to the entire Saudi Arabia Royal Fleet. Thus the Boeing 747 private jets and the HZ-HM1 a 747 built-in 2001 are at his disposal. It won’t be incorrect to assume his multi-million private Boeing 747 jet would be as luxurious as its aquatic counterpart superyacht Serene.



The Hindu reported that the hospitable prince once gave Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan his private plane to return home as he could not let his guest travel in a commercial aircraft.



MBS also gifted Khan a set of a specially crafted watch gold pen ring and cufflinks that Imran later sold for $2 million.



The art lover got home a $450 million Salvator Mundi painting –

The 38-year-old law degree holder is an avid art collector like the other members of the Saudi royal family that could be worth as much as $1.4 trillion. With such enormous wealth one can certainly afford to get embroiled in a bidding war for a $450 million Leonardo da Vinci painting at a Christie’s auction.



Acquired in 2017 Prince Mohammed made the winning bid on Salvator Mundi anonymously by phone. Ever since the auction the whereabouts of the artwork were unknown. Speculations were rife that Mohammed’s yacht Serene housed the nearly half-billion dollar Salvator Mundi. MBS himself puts rumors to rest by building a dedicated museum to show this masterpiece to the world.



All work and some play! MBS’s party became the talk of a country.

A young leader blue-blooded with bottomless pits of wealth how can controversy possibly stay away? When this prince wants to party he doesn’t go to the party; instead the party comes to him. In 2015 MBS made an entire archipelago in Male Maldives his party venue. Complete with over 100 exotic dancers and performers from around the globe the then 29-year-old Saudi crown prince splurged $50 million on unrestricted revelry. Velaa a private island in the Maldives well-known as one of the world’s most luxurious and expensive destinations witnessed a dozen Saudi’s enjoy artificial snow on the pristine beaches and lavish villas complete with private decks swimming pools and butlers.



A staff of 300 catered to MBS his lucky guests and big names from around the world including Pitbull “Gangnam Style” Korean rapper Psy and DJ Afrojack. As news of Mohammed’s visit leaked in a local publication MBS and his delegation were gone according to The Print.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdGFyLmNvLnVrL2FydHMtYW5kLWN1bHR1cmUvZmlsbS1hbmQtdHYvdGhlLWNyb3duLXNlYXNvbi01LWFsbC10aGUtZmlsbWluZy1sb2NhdGlvbnMtZm9yLWhpdC1uZXRmbGl4LXNob3ctaW5jbHVkaW5nLXdlbnR3b3J0aC13b29kaG91c2UtMzk1NTk4OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Crown Season 5: All the filming locations for hit Netflix show including Wentworth Woodhouse,"Watch more of our videos on Shots!

You could still get a V8-powered Corvette Mustang or Camaro but horsepower was lower than previous generations and performance was less than stellar. For example the standard V8 for the 1987 Chevy Camaro Z28 produced an anemic 170 horsepower from 305ci and could go from 0-60 mph in 8.1-seconds.

A couple of months back I wrote an article about the 1986 Dodge Omni GLH-S and how Carroll Shelby’s influence made it into a pretty good hot hatchback. The following year Dodge relied on Shelby again to enhance its products and save the day for Mopar fans.

1987 Dodge Shadow Shelby CSX

The Pick of the Day is a 1987 Dodge Shadow Shelby CSX listed for sale on ClassicCars.com by a dealer in Henderson Nevada. (Click the link to view the listing)

“The first Shelby CSX (Carroll Shelby eXperimental) was a limited-production high performance car based on the turbocharged intercooled Dodge Shadow” the listing states. “They were offered by Shelby Automobiles Inc. from 1987 through 1989. Only 750 were built in 1987.”

This Shelby-influenced Shadow is powered by a turbocharged and intercooled 2.2-liter inline-four engine that produced a factory-rated 175 horsepower at 5300 rpm and 175 lb-ft of torque at 4800 rpm. The engine is paired with a five-speed manual transmission. An ’87 Dodge Shadow Shelby CSX had a 0-60 mph time of 7.1 seconds which is a one-second faster than the aforementioned Camaro.

Shelby Engine Serial Number Plate

Pat Cummins Dean Elgar divided over two-day Test,"Australia's triumph over South Africa inside two days has caused plenty of debate across the cricket community with all eyes on The Gabba curators for an extremely bowler-friendly pitch.

In less than 150 overs during the first Test in Brisbane 34 wickets fell between the two sides as the hosts took a 1-0 lead in the three-game series.

Many fans and experts raised their eyebrows when the pitch was first unveiled with plenty of grass left on that was always likely to assist the bowlers more than the batsmen.

But the question now is whether or not a two-day Test match is good or bad for cricket?

South African captain Dean Elgar was highly-critical of the pitch and believes it was unsafe for batsmen.

""You’ve got to ask yourself the question - is that a good advertisement for our format?"" he said in his post-match press conference.

""Thirty-four wickets in two days – pretty one-sided affair I would say. I am a purist of this format and we want to see the game go to four or five days.

""And the nature of it how it started to play with some seriously steep bounce with the old ball you are kind of on a hiding to none as a batting unit.

""If you think about it only two or maybe three batters applied themselves half-decently and scored runs. I don’t think it was a very good Test wicket.

""I said [to the umpires] how long does it go on for until it potentially is unsafe? It was never to try and change or put a halt to the game no doubt. That’s where the umpire’s discretion comes into play not us as players.

""I am not a curator I wouldn’t know how to prepare a cricket pitch but it was interesting to see how quickly this one actually did start divoting and how quickly the ball sped up especially the new ball...and also today the older ball was flying through which shouldn’t be really happening.

""The divots had quite a big role to play with the sideways movement and up and down and that steep bounce which is quite something to face.""

Eglar's criticism of the playing conditions were echoed by Indian great Virender Sehwag who took to social media to condemn the work from the Brisbane ground staff.

142 overs and not even lasting 2 days and they have the audacity to lecture on what kind of pitches are needed. Had it happened in India it would have been labelled end of test cricket ruining test cricket and what not. The Hypocrisy is mind-boggling . #AUSvSA — Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) December 18 2022

But on the contrary Aussie skipper Pat Cummins didn't have too many concerns - which shouldn't come as a huge surprise after he finished with a five-wicket haul in the second innings.

""Personally I don't mind when the groundsman err on the greener side occasionally"" he said.

""I’ve played a lot of Test matches when they’ve erred on the flatter side so I think it was the same for both teams.

""If you're going to lose the match you’d probably try anything wouldn’t you. There was some sideways movement a little bit of up and down bounce but it was fine.

""There's no balls jumping off a length or anything like that...no way [was it dangerous].""

The man who was at the forefront of the preparation of the pitch - David Sandurski - was also quizzed on his thoughts of the Test.

But speaking to News Corp Sandurski refused to defend the wicket and admitted it wasn't up to Test standard.

“The proof is in the pudding’’ he said.

""The scorecards are there. You can’t deny it. It is obviously not good enough for a match of this magnitude.

“I am obviously disappointed. No-one wants to have a two day Test. All the signs in the preparation pointed towards it being a reasonable wicket.

""Two really good bowling line-ups have exposed every bit of that wicket that they could.’’

The dealership showcases the new product to interested customers on a local demo field. Blue White has an office in Fresno and offers support and software upgrades as the system improves.

Autonomy Report

Jimmy Perry never imagined his career would evolve the way it did when he started working in sales for Fresno Equipment 18 years ago.

His outlook changed when general manager Joseph Ayerza and ownership added the top brands of shortline almond equipment (Orchard Rite Thomas) to complement the brands (Exact and Weiss McNair) they were already carrying. Sales have nearly tripled for the 2-store John Deere dealer over the last 2 decades and Perry is all in for the long haul.

The central California native was recently promoted to store and sales manager for Fresno Equipment’s Fresno location. They also have a store in Five Points Calif.

Fresno Equipment’s staff has grown considerably since Perry joined the team. It includes 8 people in the sales department 30 service (field and shop) technicians and 2 precision (Integrated Solutions Department) specialists. Perry attributes the growth to strong leadership and a culture built on trust between ownership and employees.

Their customer base includes growers who farm on average between 300-400 acres producing almonds pistachios walnuts wine grapes table grapes raisin grapes citrus hay corn and/or wheat. They also serve some corporate farms as big as 40000 acres.

Selling Autonomy

One of the first things that catches your eye at the Fresno location is the Blue White Robotics autonomous tractor on display right outside the entrance.

“We’ve been talking with Blue White for the last 10 months” Perry says. “We already have a customer using it and have 10-12 other leads.”

Fresno Equipment recently became a licensed dealer for BlueWhite autonomous tractor kits. The system is available in most orchard and vineyard models to perform tasks such as mowing discing spraying and more aimed at getting the job done with greater precision and productivity while seeing significant savings in operational costs.

The autonomous tractor kit is available through an annual service model with virtually unlimited support from BlueWhite who has an office in Fresno. Regular software and hardware updates will be available as the system improves according to the dealership.

“Oh I think it (increased adoption of autonomous equipment) is coming” Perry says. “That’s why we’re trying to stay ahead of the game. With all the regulations labor laws and shortages here in California this kind of technology is going to be a gamechanger.

“To help familiarize customers with it we’re doing a lot of demos. We take the equipment to their fields and help them get adapted to it.”

Breaking Down Barriers

Just because they’re selling autonomy doesn’t necessarily mean all customers are ready to invest. From a dealer’s perspective Perry sees infrastructure as the biggest barrier for entry.

“As we trend from autonomous diesel tractors to autonomous electric tractors we need to have enough electric charging stations to make sure farmers can charge equipment quickly” he says. “Right now it’s not a problem for little tractors but time will tell with big tractors. If you’re using something 8-10 hours autonomously then you’ll need to replenish the energy fast. It’s going to take a few years for us to get all the infrastructure in place to do that.”

“With all the regulations here in California ... this kind of technology is going to be a gamechanger…” – Jimmy Perry Fresno Equipment

Staying up to speed Fresno Equipment employees attended the FIRA ag robotics and technology forum which took place just a few miles down the road at the Fresno Convention Center in October 2022. The topic of barriers was widely discussed during the 3-day event. A panel of industry leaders shared their thoughts on how to increase the adoption rate of autonomous technology.

“The first thing I’d tell manufacturers is don’t overcomplicate things” says Chuck Baresich Haggerty AgRobotics founder and president. “When you bring your machine out be careful of what you’re promising. Make sure your robot can drive straight start with that. We’ve tried a lot of robots that can’t drive straight. Can they actually complete their task? Then start worrying about all the cool stuff you’re promising.”

Almond Alliance CEO Aubrey Bettencourt points out the need for basic infrastructure upgrades that would allow farmers to adopt and implement precision tools.

“We’re out in the middle of nowhere in a lot of these places” Bettencourt says. “If we don’t have rural access to underlying infrastructures (satellites internet cellular access) then we can’t use the products you’re bringing us.”

“Growers need to be open minded” adds Alain Pincot Betteravia Farms/Bonipak managing partner. “Frustration can build up quickly if you are not ready to understand some level of adaption is necessary for your operation to successfully adopt technology. Be prepared to ask the right questions.”

More Up Time No Down Time

Perry is confident his staff can help answer those questions and troubleshoot any issues customers might encounter with new technology like Blue White. Fresno Equipment has 2 full time employees working in the precision-focused Integrated Solutions Department and 14 service trucks available for backup when needed.

The staff interacts with customers on social media using Facebook and other platforms to make announcements and gauge interest in new products.

“We’re very active on social media to keep customers updated on what we’re doing” Perry says. “If something new comes out like Blue White we send an e-mail blast to our key customers and talk with them one-on-one about it.”

Perry believes Fresno Equipment is in a league of its own when it comes to customer service separating itself from the competition by doing whatever it takes to provide solutions.

“We have CSRs (parts and service outside salespeople) out running parts all the time” he says. “Our goal is more up time no down time. For example during harvest we know how critical it is to make sure everybody is up and running. We get you going first and then worry about the paperwork later.

“We’re focused on more than just selling equipment. We want to be involved in our customers’ operations and be their go-to place for parts and service as well.”

Perry works constantly with his general manager and ownership to make sure their inventory is well stocked. Early ordering is key to meeting customer needs and overcoming supply chain issues he says.

“We are always trying to stay ahead of the curve in everything we do” Perry says. “Thankfully our ownership trusts us to order what we need to keep the supply chain coming. With their blessing we’ve been able to keep the pipeline full and avoid any issues.”

In my youth Christmas Christ’s birth the world was at peace and the last few days before Santa slowed like Gert’s spoon sinking in a jar of Mr. Bill’s Southern Missouri honey.

Rarely did we have snow in Charleston a few miles from the Mississippi River. When we did it was wonderful and Gert made snow ice cream.

Santa anticipation became unbearable when Monsignor Schmidt placed the large crèche on St. Henry’s altar with Mary Joseph baby Jesus shepherds wise men animals huge live Christmas trees bedecked with blue lights and that fourth candle on the Advent Wreath was lit.

Christmas trees in our house across the street from St. Henry’s convent rectory grade high school church and playground were modest but I can still smell that live tree fragrance. I can see the large lights the glass tubed ones that bubbled opaque glass ornaments that broke if dropped and the heavy “icicles” probably made of lead that my three older sisters and me helped put on.

I especially recall when daddy lifted me to place the plastic silver angel on top which I still have and use.

With tree decorated it was exciting to get the attic box containing the manger my granddaddy Stricker made from roof shingles (he immigrated from Munster Germany in the late 1800’s founded first Ford and John Deere Dealerships in Charleston) which we gently placed on white cotton “snow” atop our 21” TV next to the tree carefully unwrapping grandaddy’s manger figures from newspaper which I still have and gleefully placing each in their proper place.

As we did all this my sisters played Christmas songs on their portable 45 record player. Gert popped corn in bacon grease in a deep cast iron skillet with lid shaking it until the corn was fully popped.

We drank grape juice ate popcorn and joyfully decorated tree and house. Daddy put brightly colored lights around our front door Gert hung a real wreath and I stood outside and stared until I nearly froze.

Those days living at home attending school across the street taught by Priests Ursuline Sisters altar server choir first grade through high school finally having beautiful ’57 Chevy Belair passed down to me from my sisters captain of our basketball team dating Lee from public high school – was a swell almost Norman Rockwell happy time.

Warnock celebrates Delta's new non-stop airline service to Cape Town,"The inaugural flight from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Int. Airport to Cape Town Int. Airport in South Africa will take place on Saturday December 17.

Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock reportedly played a key role in urging the Department of Transportation to approve Delta’s application for service to Cape Town. The application was submitted back in June and seeks to have non-stop access between the Atlanta and Cape Town airports. Delta officials report the new route will boost the local economy between $75 to $150 million annually.

The new ATL-CPT airline route is slated to run 10 times weekly with service to Cape Town and Johannesburg South Africa. Sen. Warnock said he is excited and honored for the chance to strengthen the Atlanta airport’s position as an international hub.

“This latest route further solidifies Hartsfield-Jackson’s position as a leading gateway to the world improves our nation’s access to Africa and will be an economic boon to the greater Atlanta region generating more than $75 million annually” Warnock said.

Delta’s Vice President of International Government Affairs Bob Letteney said adding more international destinations to the Atlanta airport will boost the economy and further expand travel options to far-away destinations.

“With travel demand continuing to rise Delta is focused on building an expanded network of international destinations reinforcing our mantra of 'no one better connects the world”' Letteney said. “We are grateful for the support of Senator Reverend Warnock in getting this important new route launched.”

In a letter to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation Pete Buttigieg Sen. Warnock Sen. Ossoff and six congress members requested the new direct airline route be approved citing the economic value and continued relations with Africa.

Georgia Department of Economic Development Commissioner Pat Wilson said developing a relationship with South Africa will help drive business open trade opportunities and facilitate on-going connections.

“Partnerships and relationship-building are at the heart of everything we do in economic development” Wilson said. “For more than a decade Georgia has developed impactful relationships with the government of the Western Cape hosting delegations and participating in best practices exchanges with our colleagues in Cape Town.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTcvYWlybGluZXMtY2FuLXByaWNlLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLWludG8tYS1wbGFuZS10aWNrZXQtZG9udC1idXktaXQuaHRtbNIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzEyLzE3L2FpcmxpbmVzLWNhbi1wcmljZS1jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS1pbnRvLWEtcGxhbmUtdGlja2V0LWRvbnQtYnV5LWl0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When searching for a flight be wary of offers to add your climate impact to the ticket price,"Most major airlines have sustainability initiatives in place in addition to carbon offsets – many have committed to carbon neutrality by 2050 and are exploring options like sustainable aviation fuels and more efficient aircrafts as climate priorities. United Airlines  for example has committed to net zero carbon by 2050 without any contribution from traditional carbon offsets. Among its current focuses is corporate partnerships to de-carbonize aviation and venture capital investments.

Globally the aviation industry is estimated to be responsible for about 2.1% of CO2 emissions. In the transportation sector aviation creates about 12% of CO2 emissions while road transport is attributed to 74%. Those numbers are expected to increase on a relative basis in the decades ahead as air travel increases and as auto companies make faster progress on transition to electric vehicles.

That is true but it is also a reason why many climate experts say the airlines should be more focused on bigger goals related to sustainable aviation fuels and their own net-zero goals ex-passenger contributions.

""At the moment there is no alternative to aviation when it comes to long distance and low carbon travel. Carbon offsetting is an immediate direct and pragmatic means to encourage action to limit climate change impacts at least in the short-term"" said Mariam Alqubaisi head of sustainability at Etihad Airways.

In general the way such programs work is that the carbon impact of a flight is calculated and a fee is then determined that can ""offset"" this impact minimizing or zeroing out the carbon imprint of a passenger's flight. Calculating the CO2-equivalent emissions from the flight divided by the number of miles flown and the number of passengers is the basic idea. CO2-equivalent emissions are the emissions of carbon dioxide plus those of other global warming chemicals (e.g black carbon and methane) each multiplied by their global warming potential (ratio of warming over 20 or 100 years of the chemical per unit mass to that of CO2) explained Mark Jacobson professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.

Southwest Airlines ' ""Wanna offset carbon?"" program provides a match from the company for every dollar a customer pays to offset carbon and rapid rewards bonus points – 10 points for every dollar spent.

Etihad Airways recently rolled out a program with partner CarbonClick to allow travelers to offset their flight emissions from a basket of Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) eligible projects that are geographically diverse and offer ways to support communities climate action and biodiversity. This program also gives passengers the ability to earn rewards through participation in what the airline calls Etihad Guest Conscious Choices .

Numerous airlines now offer such programs. American Airlines has a carbon offset plan in partnership with nonprofit Cool Effect  through which customers are provided options for offsetting the carbon emissions associated with their flights. Delta Air Lines has a similar program as part of its net zero initiative .

If you are upset that legroom on airplanes is shrinking you may be relieved to hear that your footprint may be next. Your carbon footprint. Airplane passengers are now given the option to offset the environmental impact of their own flight by paying an extra airfare fee for carbon offsets. Given the rising cost of air travel adding more to the price of a plane ticket may not be especially appealing but recent polling data from Morning Consult has shown that more Americans are willing to consider this a price worth paying.

Within the aviation industry a few airlines have dropped passenger carbon offset programs including JetBlue and EasyJet which ditched the concept to focus more on sustainable airline fuels and more efficient aircrafts. JetBlue achieved carbon neutrality on domestic flights in 2020 and just this month the airline said in its latest net zero carbon policy statement that lowering carbon emissions from operations will take primacy over any contribution from offsets and the goal is to ""drive down the need for carbon credits as much as possible.""

Aviation 'greenwashing'

There also remains skepticism about how well the carbon accounting works in practice and ""greenwashing"" claims have made carbon offset program including those for passengers a potential liability for the airlines. A recent Washington Post article on aviation carbon claims dinged Delta for its use of carbon offsets and that led Delta to speak in a different way about the future of offsets. New Delta chief sustainability officer Pam Fletcher told the Post she opposes buying such credits. ""It was the best tool at the time"" she said. ""So kudos to getting some momentum on climate change. Now we are laser-focused on decarbonization in our company and industry working on the issues within our own four walls.""

""Calculating an individual's carbon footprint can be as much art as science"" Environmental and Energy Study Institute executive director Daniel Bresette explained in an email.

It might be tempting to buy an offset to ease one's conscience Bressette said but the simplest offset schemes merely calculate an estimate based on how many miles the trip will cover. While that that sounds straightforward it fails to account for how fuel-efficient the aircraft is how full it will be or what the weather conditions will be.

""There are a lot of variables to consider when making an accurate calculation"" Bressette wrote.

Bresette said one factor that goes into the calculation is a mix of science and economics that airlines are expert at: estimating and reducing fuel consumption. Fuel is expensive after all making up about a quarter of operating expenses in 2022. ""That's a big share so airlines are incentivized to know precisely how much fuel a flight will need. That helps them calculate the flight's carbon footprint and an individual's share of it"" he said.

Questions to ask about carbon offsets

The harder part is figuring out how to calculate its offset. If the offset is funding tree plantings what kind of tree will be planted and where? If the offset funds renewable energy what type of energy generation will those projects be replacing? If the offset funds go to energy efficiency how carbon intensive is the energy otherwise being consumed? These questions can be answered but only after significant analysis and a lot of information-gathering. That means a lot of fine print from passengers to read.

""Until carbon offsets are better regulated and more transparent travelers need to exercise due diligence to determine whether they're worthwhile in terms of costs and benefits. Offsets should be transparent about what climate benefits a traveler is making possible"" Bresette said.

As part of consciousness-raising it is helpful for people to think in terms of their own carbon footprints and how they can reduce them. But stated preferences can be quite different from actual consumer behavior which is much harder to change.

""The bright shine on carbon offsets has dimmed"" said Scott Keyes founder of Scott's Cheap Flights.

No matter what people say in polls a vast majority of customers skip past paying an extra fee for carbon offsets when booking their flights Keyes said. ""Maybe they don't believe the extra dollars will be an effective way to create an impact or maybe they don't want to pay an extra fee for an already expensive flight.""

The price point depending on the length of flight is not high compared to the overall cost of a plane ticket. American Airlines' calculator shows a range from under $10 for shorter flights to as high as $25 for flights 13-plus hours. That price is set by the average price per tonne for the American Airlines portfolio of carbon offset projects which include forest regeneration in Mexico restoration of peat swamp in Indonesia and construction of improved cookstoves for families in Honduras. Southwest Airlines shows offsets for a New York to Los Angeles flight at $3.59 and says its pricing is based off of ""aircraft type conventional jet fuel consumption flight distance and assumed load factor.""

Consumer psychology and the environment

It's not just about the dollar amount of the carbon offset purchase in the consumer psychology.

""It's something that people are very price sensitive to"" Keyes said. ""I think that everybody wants a better environment everyone would love for flights and planes to emit less carbon but I think people have shown that they're not willing to pay extra in order to achieve that.""

He gave the example of grocery stores asking customers if they'd like to round up their total for charity – though a small number of individuals may say yes a majority will say no for similar reasons Keyes said referring to the fact that they are paying a big bill already or don't understand where the money will really be going.

Keyes cited Lufthansa Group CEO Carsten Spohr who said in 2020 the airline only saw 1-2% of passengers choose to purchase the cheapest option of carbon offsets while the more expensive alternative was ""used by so few customers that I could greet them all individually with a handshake.""

If airline travelers want to stay environmentally conscious without paying carbon offset fees Keyes recommends choosing cheaper airlines when traveling. The more expensive an airline the more culpable for airline emissions as the aircrafts usually have less seats increasing the amount of carbon emissions per individual. Consistently overpaying for flights also gives airlines more incentive to add additional flights for that route and that may also increase carbon emissions.

In other words if you want to reduce your carbon footprint on a flight the best option might be to reduce your comfort. A tradeoff many fliers are already making when they take to the skies.

""It's true that we all have a part to play in reducing carbon emissions. But it is unfair to place the burden squarely on individuals"" Bressette said. ""When I board a plane I don't have a lot of say in how the flight is going to go. Airlines though do have a lot of say which means they have a major responsibility to do right by the climate including by using sustainable aviation fuels and improving the energy efficiency of their operations.""

Devon Energy (DVN -1.44%) is one of those stocks where you need to be extremely clear about what you own or you could end up burned badly. It's not a bad company -- it's just that its stock comes with some nuances that you might overlook if you get overly enamored with its huge 9% dividend yield. And that could leave you feeling upset with yourself.

Here's why Devon Energy might be a buy for some investors but a terrible choice for those looking for consistent dividend payouts.

What does it do?

At its core Devon Energy is an oil and natural gas producer. It operates in the onshore space of the U.S. energy sector with exposure to five producing regions. It has been expanding its size via bolt-on deals recently adding exposure in the Eagle Ford basin in Texas and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.

In the third quarter Devon Energy produced roughly 614000 oil-equivalent barrels per day beating its guidance by 2%. It had 21 drilling rigs operating and brought 103 new wells into service. It has been able to keep its operating costs low which allowed its field-level cash margins to expand by 40% year over year. In other words it's doing pretty well right now.

And this is a good time to be producing oil: The average realized price of an oil-barrel equivalent for the company rose by roughly 38% year over year in Q3. That's because crude oil prices have been higher than normal -- as you might have guessed from the elevated prices you've been paying for gasoline and all the headlines outlining the various supply and-demand issues in the energy sector. Those issues range from geopolitical tensions to OPEC's decisions to cut production but the outcome has largely been generally high energy prices.

This is why Devon Energy was able to pay its shareholders a huge $1.35 per share dividend in the third quarter 61% more than the dividend it paid in the prior-year period. So far investors should really like what they see here.

There's a downside

The problem is that oil and natural gas are highly volatile commodities making the energy sector a cyclical industry prone to both impressive upturns and swift downturns. The market has experienced the full range of those dramatic swings since 2020 when the advent of the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a steep drop in global oil demand that pushed crude prices to historic lows. While that downturn was particularly intense with West Texas Intermediate crude (a key U.S. oil benchmark) actually falling below zero at one point energy price volatility really isn't all that unusual in the grand scheme of things.

So while Devon Energy is doing quite well today there will come a time when it won't be. That's just the nature of the business. Which brings the story back to its dividend. While some large oil companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron focus on providing stable dividends Devon quite intentionally does not. Management has structured its payouts in two parts with a fixed dividend that gets supplemented by a variable dividend based on the company's recent performance.

This rewards investors during the good times. However they'll collect smaller dividend checks when times get tough. Investors looking for relatively stable consistent payouts should look elsewhere.

The third quarter offers a perfect example. The payment was up 61% over Q3 2021 but it was also down nearly 13% from Q2 2022. That may seem like a modest sequential slide given the year-over-year increase but when you consider the volatile nature of oil prices there's no reason to believe that the dividend couldn't fall all the way back to the level of a year ago. Or worse to the less than $0.10 per share that Devon Energy paid in each quarter of 2019.

In essence over the past three years or so investors have likely seen the extremes of what they can expect from Devon on the dividend front. But they shouldn't count on either end of that range to be the ongoing status quo.

For the right person

To state the obvious again Devon Energy's dividend by its nature will not be a good fit for investors looking for stable payouts. However if you are specifically looking for a way to leverage yourself to increasing energy prices it could be a good fit for your portfolio. Rising energy prices should lead to larger dividend payments from Devon Energy. Thus in the end Devon Energy is an acquired taste but you have to look past today's fat dividend yield to see why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzE3L2EtYnVsbC1tYXJrZXQtaXMtY29taW5nLWZvci1vaWwtaW4tMjAyMy0zLXRvcC1zdG9jL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Bull Market Is Coming for Oil in 2023. Here Are 3 Top Stocks to Buy Now.,"Oil prices might be down but several catalysts could push crude higher in the coming year.

Crude oil prices started off the year red hot. Oil prices rallied from less than $80 a barrel to more than $125 a barrel following Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. However crude has cooled off considerably since this summer steadily falling back into the low $80s on macroeconomic concerns. That more than 20% plunge in crude oil prices means oil is in a bear market.

However a new bull market for oil looks to be coming next year. Here's why crude seems set to rebound which could fuel big gains for oil stocks.

Wall Street is very bullish on oil

Most oil market analysts believe oil prices are going much higher next year. For example Jeff Currie the global head of commodities for venerable investment bank Goldman Sachs has a $110 forecast for Brent oil (the global benchmark price) in 2023. Rival investment bank Morgan Stanley agrees expecting Brent to top the $110 a-barrel mark by the middle of next year. While others aren't quite as bullish the consensus is that oil prices will rebound in 2023.

Analysts note several catalysts that should fuel crude's rebound in 2023. Morgan Stanley summed it up in a note to clients. The bank wrote ""We remain constructive on oil prices driven by recovering demand (China reopening aviation recovering) amid constrained supply due to low levels of investment risks to Russia supply the end of SPR releases and slowdown of U.S. shale.""

The biggest catalyst is China. ""The pent-up demand out of China is going to be enormous"" according to comments by Energy Aspects director of research Amrita Sen in The Wall Street Journal. Sen believes ""that could swing demand by at least a million barrels a day and that could easily make the difference between an oil price forecast of $95 to $105 versus $120 to $130.""

Meanwhile most oil companies plan to continue keeping a relatively firm lid on investment spending and output. For example while oil giant Chevron (CVX 0.22%) plans to boost its capital budget by 25% next year to $17 billion most of that increase is due to inflation and a ramp in lower-carbon investment spending. Likewise even though ExxonMobil (XOM -0.41%) plans to boost capital spending from $22 billion this year to $23 billion-$25 billion in 2023 it expects its production will remain flat at around 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. With demand poised to rise amid continued tight supplies oil prices seem primed to rally.

A boon for oil stocks

This outlook for higher oil prices bodes well for oil companies in 2023. It will enable them to continue producing strong earnings and cash flow. Meanwhile with most oil companies limiting investment spending they'll have more money to return to their shareholders via buybacks and dividends.

Oil giants Chevron and ExxonMobil are well positioned to capitalize on higher crude oil prices next year. However three other producers stand out as even more compelling buys right now. One of them is Marathon Oil (MRO -2.21%). It trades at a bottom-of-the-barrel valuation compared to its peers (the higher the free cash flow (FCF) yield the lower the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio):

Because of that Marathon Oil has been using its oil-fueled windfall this year to gobble up its dirt cheap stock. The oil company has already retired 20% of its outstanding shares. It also used its oil-fueled cash flows to buy Ensign Natural Resources for $3 billion. That deal will boost its free cash flow by 15% assuming recent oil prices and by an even greater percentage if oil prices soar. That deal could give Marathon more fuel to buy back stock next year.

Diamondback Energy (FANG -0.75%) is another dirt cheap oil stock. That's a big reason it offers investors a high dividend yield which is currently over 6.5%. The other reason is its variable dividend strategy. What's noteworthy is that Diamondback has shifted its capital allocation strategy over the past quarter paying out a lower variable dividend so it can buy back more of its shares. The company could continue to pay a big-time dividend and gobble up more of its stock next year. It's in an even better position to capitalize on higher oil prices after recently agreeing to spend $3.3 billion to buy two cash-gushing oil companies. Those deals position it to produce even more free cash next year.

Finally analysts see a nearly 60% upside potential in Devon Energy (DVN -1.44%). They point to its strong balance sheet extensive drilling inventory and variable dividend framework. Another upside catalyst is that Devon recently closed two deals that it expects will boost its cash flow by 25% in the fourth quarter. Those acquisitions put it in an even better position to capitalize on higher oil prices next year.

High-upside oil stocks

Oil appears primed to rally sharply in 2023. While higher prices would benefit all oil stocks Marathon Diamondback and Devon stand out as best positioned to capitalize on higher crude prices. All three recently made cash-gushing acquisitions which could give them even more money to buy back their cheap stocks and pay dividends. That makes them the top oil stocks to buy heading into 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldm9ubGl2ZS5jb20vd2hhdHMtb24vcmV2aWV3cy9ob3ctcHJpbmdsZXMtY3Jpc3BzLWNvbXBhcmUtbGlkbC03OTM5NDE40gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGV2b25saXZlLmNvbS93aGF0cy1vbi9yZXZpZXdzL2hvdy1wcmluZ2xlcy1jcmlzcHMtY29tcGFyZS1saWRsLTc5Mzk0MTguYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Pringles crisps compare with Lidl and Aldi copycat versions,"With the cost of living crisis continuing to bite many families are looking to save a bit of money by switching from their favourite brands to cheaper supermarket own-brands.

Pringles famous for its stackable potato-based crisps and now-retired slogan “once you pop you can’t stop” ranks 28th on The Grocer’s list of Britain’s biggest brands 2022  with sales of nearly £265m. It’s below crisp giant Walkers in fourth place but above Doritos (33rd) Hula Hoops (52nd) and McCoy’s (59th).

Discount chains Lidl and Aldi are well known for creating their own versions of branded products which aim to look and taste like the real deal. They both have their own Pringles dupes which like Pringles come in original BBQ and sour cream and onion flavours.

We compared original tubes of Pringles Lidl version Snaktastic and Aldi version Snackrite to see how closely the cheaper versions resemble Pringles and whether it’s worth considering a swap this Christmas.

Pringles

Per 100g:

Fat 31g

Of which saturates 6.6g

Salt 1.1g

The tube is slightly taller than the Lidl and Aldi ones but the same diameter. Lidl and Aldi stackable crisps themselves are exactly the same size and shape as Pringles. Pringles have the lowest salt content.

Lidl Snaktastic

175g

£1.33 – £0.76/100g

Energy 548kcal

Fat 34g

Of which saturates 3.5g

Salt 1.4g

Given the heavier pack weight shorter tube but same sized crisps each one must be a bit thicker than a Pringle. To look at the crisps have a slightly smoother surface. In terms of taste and texture there’s barely any noticeable difference between these and Pringles.

Aldi Snackrite

165g – same as Pringles

£1.25 here – £0.76/100g – same as Lidl

Energy 489kcal

Fat 24g

Of which saturates 2.3g

Salt 1.2g

These are less likely than the Lidl crisps to be successfully passed off as Pringles if served in a bowl rather than in the tube. They taste similar but have a slightly rougher finish than Pringles and are a bit thinner and more brittle. However these are the healthiest option.

KEY TAKEAWAYS: $10k a month is equivilent to earning $120000 a year $2500 a week or $333 a day.

20+ Realistic Ways to Make $10000 a Month

Below are some of the best ways you can start making 10k a month or more. While it won't be extremely easy it's certainly possible if you have a plan to get there whether you want to make $3000 a month or $10000 a month.

Start a Blog to Make 10k a Month

Blogging is by no means a get rich quick scheme – but it's possible to make over $10000 a month with the right strategy.

If you're looking for ways to make 10000 per month online – blogging is one of my favorite methods to make money.

Best of all the cost to start a blog is minimal – making it a viable option for anyone looking for a digital side hustle.

For some people being able to work alone is another benefit of this gig.

When you start a blog you'll want to have a few concepts nailed down such as: what is the niche of your blog how will your blog make money and how much time will you spend working on your blog.

How you answer these questions will help you to determine how long it will take you to reach 10k a month.

For those willing to put in a significant amount of time (and sometimes money!) you can grow your income much quicker than those who view their website as a hobby.

When getting started you'll want to determine how you will acquire traffic for your website – one of the essential factors of your income capabilities.

There are a few main sources of traffic including: SEO (Google) Pinterest Referral Email Social Media and Direct.

While each of these traffic sources has their own benefits and drawbacks I'd work on focusing on one or two when starting your blog. For 99% of bloggers this is SEO or Pinterest traffic. These sources have the largest base of users therefore offering the most potential traffic for your blog.

Once your blog has started you'll need to determine how you will make money. For most bloggers it's usually through a combination of display advertising (like Mediavine) affiliate links and sponsored posts.

Depending on the number of users and pageviews your website gets it's possible to make over $2000 per month from display advertising alone. Affiliate marketing will often exceed this but it depends on the type of posts and the quality of your audience.

Check out my website earnings over the past year. You can see how fast you can scale a blog and reach a large income with this form of digital real estate. If you want to make $100k a year in passive income blogging is a great option.

Earning 10k a month blogging is certainly possible but it will take some time and knowledge to reach your goals.

If you're looking to start a blog I recommend using SiteGround to start your blog on WordPress and check out these types of blogs that make money.

Become a Freelancer to Make $10000 a Month

Freelancing can be quite lucrative and a great method to increase your income and make $10k a month or more.

Depending on the type of freelancing you do you can easily grow your earnings to over $500 a day or $10000 per month.

For example a freelance software engineer earns an average of $11200 per year according to Zippia.

How?

Freelance work is typically paid on a per job basis. This means the faster you can complete a job the higher the income potential you'll have. By becoming more efficient with your time you can score a quick boost of income.

But that's not it.

Depending on the amount and type of work you have you could consider hiring a less experienced candidate capable of doing the grunt work for you. This will allow you to output more work while still being profitable.

Freelance work can be difficult in some aspects but there are some easy freelance jobs as well. Some people will use freelance jobs to escape their 9 to 5 job but instead of having just one “boss” they end up having multiple.

If you're looking into freelance work it's wise to set boundaries with your clients so they understand your expectations.

There are many types of freelance jobs you can consider for almost every skill. From freelance writing to programming or even SEO consulting your options are almost limitless – as is your ability to get paid.

Here are a few common freelance skills that are in demand:

Freelance writing

Programming

Marketing

Accounting and Bookkeeping

Graphic design

Copywriting

Your skills will determine your pay as a freelancer. For example those able to create compelling and unique articles can make much more than a beginner freelance writer.

Check out some of these writers charging over $100 an hour for their work.

Before you can sell your services to clients you'll need to establish a portfolio of work. This might mean you'll end up working for free in the beginning stages of your journey.

Check out the video below to learn how you can earn $10000 a month or more freelancing.

Make $10k a Month as a Virtual Assistant

If you're wondering how to make $10k a month you might not think of working as a virtual assistant at first thought.

But don't overlook this remote side hustle!

Virtual assistants can make great money for completing a variety of tasks online. This is one of my favorite ways to make $10 a month online because there is very little risk and it doesn't require unique skills to get started.

As a virtual assistant you'll be asked to send emails perform social media management manage website content and more.

If you're just getting started and don't have any special skills many business owners will happily train you to complete them.

To get started you can find work on freelance sites like Upwork or Fiverr or you can reach out directly to bloggers and online business owners who might need help managing their business.

The amount of money you can make will depend on your skills and experience but some virtual assistants can make upwards of $10k a month.

Invest to Make 10k a Month

Investing can be an excellent method to make $10k a month if you have some capital to deploy upfront. There are many methods of investing you can take advantage of including investing in stocks real estate small businesses cryptocurrency and more. We'll explore some of these below!

Investing is a great way to turn money into more money so you can make money on autopilot.

To better understand how much money you can make investing let's do some math.

If your goal is to make an extra 10k per month let's take a look at investing in the stock market. Assuming a 7% annual return or .58% per month you would need to invest around $1.72 million to reach your goal. Okay so this is pretty unrealistic. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't take advantage.

By making consistent contributions into your investment accounts you can slowly build your way to 10k per month.

If you're looking to invest in your favorite companies I recommend using Acorns. You'll get a free $10 when you register below!

Invest Automatically with Acorns 📈 Plus you'll get $10 completely free when you use the link below to get started! With Acorns you can start investing with as little as $5 by automatically rounding up spare change. Sign Up Now! Disclosure: This link is an affiliate link meaning at no additional cost to you I will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.

But the stock market isn't the only way to invest.

What about real estate?

Real estate also provides an opportunity to grow your money and earn $10000 per month. Similar to other investments it's going to take some money to get started if you want to make serious money.

One method to do this is through owning rental properties. It's possible to find rental properties that cash flow thousands of dollars each month.

For example if you are capable of purchasing a quadplex in which each door rents for $1000 per month but your mortgage and expenses amount to $2000 per month you could make a profit of $2000 monthly. Multiple this times 5 and you'll be earning $10k per month.

Another method is using crowdfunded real estate like LEX Markets.

LEX Markets is my favorite platform to make money with real estate because you won't have to deal with the headache and stress of rental properties. Sign up below to get started!

LEX Markets 5 · Real Estate · $250 Min. LEX Markets. Earn up to $500 in free money when you create a new account! Invest in commercial real estate debt with. Earn up to $500 in free money when you create a new account! Risk Level Low Avg. Return 8%-19% Advertising Disclosure Claim Welcome Bonus

But there are several other options outside of LEX Markets. Another one of my favorite ways to invest is in short term real estate debt with Groundfloor.

This platform allows you to invest in short term debts for real estate investors. In simplest terms you can loan money to investors who need cash to complete an investment.

This is often the case for people flipping homes. They might need a few thousand dollars to complete the flip which you can lend them and earn interest on your money.

Groundfloor allows you to invest without a fortune. Create your account here to get started!

Whenever investing it's important to remember that there is risk involved so you should only invest what you can afford to lose.

You might also consider investing in cryptocurrency. While I personally don't see it as an investment – many people do.

This teenager turned his $1000 into $4.5 million by purchasing bitcoin.

Cryptocurrencies are very speculative in nature and tend to fluctuate in price daily anywhere from 2% to over 15%. If you choose to invest in cryptocurrencies (or any investment) – make sure you can afford to lose your money.

If you're interested in purchasing Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies I recommend using Crypto.com to get started. It is super simple to use and you can get started for less than $5.

Because cryptocurrencies fluctuate in value it's possible to make $10k per month.

Crypto can be very risky so be careful if you choose to invest your money in this asset.

Become a Consultant

Do you have special skills? You can make great money by teaching others and offering advice through consulting.

For example if you're knowledgable about search engine optimization – you could offer your services to companies that want to improve their rankings.

If you're an expert in social media marketing – you could offer your services to businesses that want to reach a larger audience.

For example Marie Haynes is an extremely popular (and skilled!) SEO consultant who charges over $9500 for an SEO audit. So if you're trying to think of how to make $10k a month it's fair to say consulting can be a lucrative method.

If you're interested in becoming a consultant here are a few things to keep in mind:

First you need to identify your area of expertise.

What are you good at? What do you enjoy doing?

What are the skills that you have that others don't?

Once you've identified your areas of expertise you need to start marketing yourself as a consultant and proving your skills.

You need to make sure that potential clients know about your skills and abilities and you can do this by creating a website speaking at events or writing articles.

You should also consider joining a professional organization in your field as this can help you network with other consultants and potential clients.

If you want to be successful as a consultant you need to be able to identify the needs of your clients and offer them solutions.

You also need to be able to build relationships and trust with your clients.

Finally you need to be able to deliver results.

If you can do all of these things you'll be well on your way to being a successful consultant and making $10k a month or much more.

Make Money Each Month with Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing is an easy way to earn passive income with the potential to make thousands of dollars each month online.

What exactly is affiliate marketing?

In simplest terms affiliate marketing is the process in which you are compensated for facilitating a transaction. For example perhaps you have a YouTube channel that is focused on plumbing techniques and tips. If you post a video recommending a specific piece of plumbing equipment you could partner with the company that produces the item and get a portion of the proceeds for each sale.

There are many methods you can use to make money with affiliate marketing including social media YouTube or a website. I'll explore some of the best ways to make money with affiliate marketing and some of the most common affiliate platforms below.

Social Media Accounts

Social media accounts are an extremely common way to make money with affiliate marketing. Between Facebook Twitter Instagram a YouTube channel and other rising social media platforms there is no shortage or opportunity.

By posting affiliate links on your accounts you can earn a commission for each sale that occurs through your link.

For those with large established followings this could be the easiest way to earn $10000 a month. Because social media accounts are free to start – there's no reason not to give it a shot.

You can try these ways to make money with Reddit or these ways to make money with Snapchat!

YouTube Channel

While YouTube channels are technically a form of social media I believe they deserve a category of their own. Because the content is video based this provides an even better way to make money online through affiliate links.

By creating review and comparison videos you can easily promote your links in the video description and comments to increase your sales and earnings.

You can even make money with YouTube without making videos!

Blog or Website

Affiliate links are often plastered on many websites and blogs – and for good reason. They are one of the most effective ways to earn money online for publishers. They allow bloggers to get paid for their hard work writing great content.

Email List

Another way affiliate marketers can make money is through an email list. You'll first need to determine a way to gather emails from people whether it's by offering a free download of something or another method.

You can then send emails to your list with affiliate offers embedded in the email. Depending on how many people are on your email list you can potentially make thousands of dollars with every email sent.

For example The Hustle has millions of subscribers and sold for over $10 million!

This can be an excellent way to make money in a day just by sending one email blast.

Being successful with affiliate marketing can take some time but it is well worth it and a great option to make $10k a month.

Start a Local Business

One of my favorite ways to make 10k a month is by starting a local service business. These businesses often get overlooked because they aren't as sexy as other options but they're still some of the best business ideas in my book.

Many of these small businesses can bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. For example many lawn care or pressure washing businesses can have 7 figure earnings in less than 2 years time.

Check out these local businesses I found for sale in my area. They're selling for over $1 million!

Many small service-based businesses do not require special skills or knowledge to get started and can turn into a full time job. The benefits of being an entrepreneur can be amazing which most people dream of. And it's completely possible!

Start by outlining the services you can offer and set a price for them. This will vary depending on the type of services you offer. Most service-based businesses will price their work depending on the number of hours the job will take to complete.

When starting a business you'll need to be capable of selling your services to attract new customers. You'll want to learn how to sell effectively to better your conversion rates and increase sales for your business.

You can check out these profitable business ideas for anyone or these business ideas for men or women to get started!

Sell Products via E-commerce Sites

Selling products via e-commerce sites is one of the best ways to make money online because there are so many potential options.

For example some entrepreneurs might choose to sell via Amazon FBA. This process involves having Amazon fulfill and ship products for you – for a small fee. You ship your items directly to Amazon and they will ship them to your customers doorstep.

There are many entrepreneurs who have made six figures each month with Amazon FBA. Check out the video below to learn how to start an Amazon FBA business.

But it doesn't stop there. You can also opt to start your own e-commerce website or online store and sell products directly to customers to start making money. This comes with larger profit margins but you'll need to have the skills to build your website and acquire new customers. By creating an online store you can grow your income and earn thousands per month online.

When you sell a product through an online store of your own you'll need to think through the logistics of your business. You might want to learn the most affordable shipping options or payment processing venders to lower your expenses.

You'll also want to consider your time spent fulfilling orders. Your time is not free so you'll want to keep track of the hours you're working to see if your business is still profitable.

Marketing will play an essential role in growing your sales online. You'll want to think of some ideas to connect with potential customers and expand your business.

Ask for a Raise

While it's likely that asking for a raise won't net you an extra $10000 per month it's one way to boost your income on your journey.

Asking for a raise is a simple and free way to possibly increase your income every single month doing the same job.

When asking for a raise be sure to justify your pay with any numbers or performance metrics you have.

You'll want to visualize your skills and explain the value you provide to the company you work for. Check out some of these tips to asking for a raise!

Switch Jobs to Make $10000 a Month

Similar to asking for a raise switching jobs can be an alternative way to get access to more cash every month through your 9 to 5.

If you currently work in a low-paying job or career you might consider switching to something more lucrative.

There are plenty of high paying jobs that pay $200k a year or more and some of them don't require a college degree!

Finding a higher paying job isn't always easy so you can check out some of these job hunting tips for more help.

Sell Online Courses or Digital Products

Another way that bloggers and website owners can profit from their digital real estate is by selling online courses or digital products.

You'll want to match your audience with the course you aim to create. For example if your following is dedicated to health and fitness you might consider creating a course that focuses on helping others get in shape and eat healthy.

For example check out this digital product I found on Etsy. It's being sold for $24 each and has over 1300 sales!

Depending on the complexity of your course you might be capable of selling it for a few hundred dollars per purchase.

One thing I love about this business model is that it likely won't cost you much money at all to get started and it will turn into passive income once completed.

You can sell your course or digital products over and over to generate income every month.

Another benefit – you don't necessarily need an established audience to get started. Instead you might consider running Facebook ads to attract potential customers. While Facebook ads can be expensive they can still be profitable for your business and drastically increase your sales.

You can also set up an affiliate program for your course so others can promote it for you.

It's possible to make 10 thousand dollars a month selling courses online if you're willing to put in the time and effort to understand your audience and their needs.

Check out the video below for more info in selling digital courses!

Rent Out Things You Own

There are many items you can rent out to make some extra cash every month. From renting out an extra room in your home to renting out a lawnmower try to gather any items that regularly go unused and try to rent them out online.

A simple post on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace should do the trick. You can choose to rent your items per day or per hour depending on the type of item you have.

Publish a Book

Publishing a book can be scary but with todays access to free tools and the ability to self-publish your book there's no better time.

Book sales can be an excellent method to generate passive income each month.

Work as a Proofreader

Proofreading can be an excellent side hustle (and even full time job) if you want to make $10k a month.

With proofreading you'll need to be able to identify errors in grammar spelling and punctuation as well as provide feedback on the overall clarity and flow of the writing. While you don't need to be an expert in the English language you will need to have a keen eye for detail and excellent editing skills.

That's where you come in.

If you have an extensive knowledge of social media marketing you can make a great income by offering your services to small businesses and large corporations.

To be successful you'll need to have an understanding of which channels and platforms are best for each audience and how you can create content that will engage them.

You'll also need to be able to measure the results of your campaigns so that you can show your clients the ROI of your services.

By Joe Lauria / Consortium News

The New York Times reported Friday that European regulators are considering sanctions against Twitter because it suspended the accounts of three establishment journalists.

[Early Saturday morning Musk tweeted that he was lifting the ban after the results of a poll he ran.]

The subtitle in the Times story said: “Elon Musk’s moves this week set off a heated debate about complex issues of free speech and online censorship.”

Set off? Independent media like Consortium News has been debating these issues for a few years now but the Times just seems to have noticed. Why? Because corporate journalists are now the victims.

The story begins:

“Elon Musk’s decision to abruptly suspend several journalists from Twitter sparked an outcry on Friday from First Amendment advocates threats of sanctions from European regulators and questions about the social media platform’s future as a gathering place for news and ideas. But as people debated complex novel issues of free speech and online censorship the move also underscored the role of a simpler more enduring element of American life: the press baron.”

These are not “novel” issues. They have been ongoing. Where have the outcries from First Amendment advocates been?

Comparing Musk to William Randolph Hearst and Rupert Murdoch the Times said

“Twitter albeit a different beast from newspapers and TV networks enticed journalists by promoting itself as a virtual town square. Now Mr. Musk despite his stated wish ‘that even my worst critics remain on Twitter’ is flexing his ownership muscle in seemingly arbitrary ways appearing to stamp out accounts that personally displease him.”

If anyone posted real-time locations & addresses of NYT reporters FBI would be investigating there’d be hearings on Capitol Hill & Biden would give speeches about end of democracy! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 16 2022

A vice president of the European Commission tweeted that Musk’s move violated the E.U.’s Digital Services and Media Freedom Acts which the Times said “serves as a kind of rule book for moderating online content.” The official tweeted: “There are red lines. And sanctions soon.”

One wonders why suspending independent journalists doesn’t cross the same red lines.

The journalists from the Times The Washington Post CNN and other outlets were banned when Twitter owner Elon Musk said they had endangered his and his family’s safety by reporting on Twitter’s suspension of a site (and apparently linking to that site) that published the geolocation of his private plane.

Musk mocked the reaction of the mainstream media for suddenly discovering free speech on Twitter especially after it did not protest Twitter suspending The New York Post‘s account after the Hunter Biden laptop story days before the 2016 election.

So inspiring to see the newfound love of freedom of speech by the press 🥰 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 16 2022

Welcome mainstream media to the club. For journalists independent of the corporate media being banned by Twitter or other platforms is nothing new.

Two of CN‘s regular contributors — Scott Ritter and Patrick Lawrence — have been permanently banned and remain banned even after Musk’s takeover. CN board member Garland Nixon was permanently suspended under Musk’s Twitter but then restored. He has also been temporarily suspended by Facebook.

(For the record no journalist either establishment or independent should be suspended as a rule from social media unless they do recklessly endanger lives.)

Consortium News’ PayPal account was permanently suspended and NewsGuard has given CN its scarlet mark. So we know what we are up against which establishment media just got a small taste of.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay9uZXdzL2dyZWF0ZXItbWFuY2hlc3Rlci1uZXdzL3BvbGljZS1kaXNjb3Zlci1jYW5uYWJpcy1mYXJtLWFmdGVyLTI1NzgzMzIz0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFuY2hlc3RlcmV2ZW5pbmduZXdzLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvZ3JlYXRlci1tYW5jaGVzdGVyLW5ld3MvcG9saWNlLWRpc2NvdmVyLWNhbm5hYmlzLWZhcm0tYWZ0ZXItMjU3ODMzMjMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police discover cannabis farm after fire rips through house,"Something went wrong please try again later.

And when it comes to the kind of little treats you need for birthday parties kids’ crafts and Christmas stockings Dollar General has you covered. But what are the Dollar General Christmas Hours for 2022? AKA: how long can you push off that last-minute shopping? Romper spoke with a representative from the company to get the information you need to put things off until the last possible minute.

Is Dollar General open on Christmas Eve 2022?

In this department the General will not let you down. Dollar General’s Christmas Eve 2022 store hours might in fact cater to the Tardy Tommys among us. Not only will Dollar General be open on Christmas Eve a representative confirmed to Romper but some stores will even offer extended hours opening an hour early at 7 a.m. and remaining open until 10 p.m. While there may be some store to store differences (more on that in a bit) it’s safe to say that you’ll be able to get last minute gifts and stocking stuffers at Dollar General on Christmas Eve.

Is Dollar General open on Christmas Day 2022?

While late-shoppers can find a reprieve on Christmas Eve Dollar General’s Christmas Day 2022 hours offer no quarter. Dollar General will be closed on Christmas Day and honestly good for them: their employees should be able to spend a holiday with their loved ones.

If you didn’t get gifts before the day you’re supposed to give them well not to procrasti-shame you or anything that only works for the birthday party your kid told you about the day before not Christmas.

Dollar General’s holiday hours vary by location.

A representative from Dollar General confirmed to Romper that while none of their locations will be open on Christmas Day Christmas Eve hours can vary by location. So while shoppers can generally (#pun) expect to be able to do a last minute Christmas Eve run and may even have the benefit of an extra hour other stores might have traditional or even shortened hours.

This event marks a milestone in human population and development. According to the United Nations the reason for this growth in population can be accounted for because of medical and health improvements better nutrition and personal hygiene.

Births are outnumbering deaths which causes the rise in population rather than a stable or stagnant number.

It’s widely speculated that the world’s population reached 1 billion near the early 19th century. From there it only took approximately 100 years to go from 1 billion to 2 billion people.

The UN attributes this population growth to ample fertility rates in various countries and predicts that the world population will reach 9 billion by 2037. However it only took 12 years for the population to increase from 7 billion to 8 billion. This prediction marks a sign that population growth around the world is just starting to slow down.

The continued increase in population emphasizes urgency in economic development while maintaining environmental safety. It is thought that this predicted slower growth of the human population will help mitigate some environmental change in the future.

Environmental change and damage has resulted from the world’s current rising population. However the UN found that many wealthier regions contribute to the majority of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. These wealthier regions often have stagnant or declining population trends while poorer regions tend to have more rapidly increasing populations.

According to UN DESA Policy Brief No. 140 ”rapid population growth poses challenges to progress in social and economic development by necessitating an ever-increasing investment of resources to meet the needs of growing numbers of people.”

These factors can perpetuate poverty for many countries who are already struggling economically.

Here's What History Shows.,"Stocks usually go down during recessions but long-term investors can still come out on top.

Fannie Mae expects a modest recession to begin in the first quarter of 2023 and 60% of the economists polled by Reuters think the U.S. economy will enter a recession sometime next year. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg think there's a 65% risk of a recession over the next 12 months.

All of the experts aren't predicting a recession but enough are for investors to take notice. Should you buy stocks if a recession is coming in 2023? Here's what history shows.

Looking at past recessions

You probably won't be surprised that stocks usually decline during recessions. Sometimes they fall especially hard.

For example during the Great Recession that began in late 2007 and went through mid-2009 the S&P 500 lost more than half its value at one point. By the end of the recession the major market index was still down more than 30%. (The shading on the charts below reflects when the U.S. economy was in recession.)

However the Great Recession (as its name implies) was especially bad. The first recession of the 21st century is a better one to examine to get a feel for how stocks are more likely to perform.

Believe it or not though stocks don't always plunge during a recession. In 1980 the S&P 500 even exited a recession in positive territory and never fell more than 9% below the pre-recession level.

What matters most

If a recession occurs in 2023 there's a real possibility that your portfolio value will decline if you're invested in stocks. But what matters most is your investment time horizon.

The charts shown above don't tell the full story. If you bought the S&P 500 index before any of the last 10 U.S. recessions and held you would eventually have positive returns in every case. Sometimes you'd be in positive territory within only a few months. In other cases it would have taken several years.

Your investment time horizon should be the most important factor in helping you decide whether or not to buy stocks. If you need the money that you plan to invest over the next five years or so it's probably better to stay away from stocks.

However the stock market usually performs relatively well over five-year and 10-year periods. And there has never been a 20-year period where the S&P 500 has delivered a negative return.

Two winning strategies

One winning strategy that long-term investors could use even if the U.S. economy enters a recession next year is to dollar-cost average. With this approach you invest equal amounts at regular intervals over time. The dollar-cost averaging strategy can be used with any asset including individual stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Another good strategy for investing when a recession is on the way is to buy stocks of companies that are practically recession-proof. For example discount retailers such as Walmart (WMT 0.07%) and Dollar General (DG 0.06%) tend to perform relatively well during economic downturns as customers look for ways to save money.

The stocks of some drugmakers can also deliver positive returns during recessions. Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM -1.60%) stands out as one high-flying stock to buy and hold if a recession is on the way. The biopharmaceutical company has multiple catalysts that could boost its share price further.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.91%) is a lower-risk biotech stock to consider as well. The company is highly profitable with strong revenue and earnings growth thanks to its monopoly in treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. Vertex also has a couple of new drugs potentially on the way to approval."

COLUMBIA S.C. — Electric bills will go up by about 6% in January for Dominion Energy's South Carolina residential customers.

The South Carolina Public Service Commission voted 5-1 for an unusual midyear rate increase Thursday local news outlets report making up for the higher-than-projected cost of coal and natural gas that the Virginia-based utility is paying.

A residential customer who uses 1000 kilowatt hours of electricity per month will see their bill rise from $132.79 to $140.53.

The rate increase is less than Dominion had sought. It filed in August to raise bills by 14% for residential customers 17% for commercial customers and 27% for industrial customers. The lower increase was hammered out with the company by Public Service Commission staff.

Under the plan approved Thursday commercial customers will see bills rise by 7% while industrial customers will pay 11% more.

Dominion's yearly rate is usually set in April and the company warns that it will need another round of rate increases then because the increase approved Thursday will leave it a projected $400 million short of what it will pay for coal and natural gas to fuel its generating plants. Regulated utilities are traditionally entitled to recover the full cost of fuel from customers.

Dominion’s manager of regulation Thomas Rooks called Thursday’s increase a “measured step.”

“This is a fair proposal right now for customers” Rooks said.

Commissioner Thomas Ervin voted against the rate increase citing the company’s failure to set up a program using commodity market contracts to hedge against price increases despite a commission request two years ago for Dominion to begin hedging.

“In the meantime natural gas prices increased over 100% this past year and I predict it’s going to increase again next year” Ervin said.

Others agreed that the commission should have penalized the company for not doing more to seek fuel sources with less price volatility.

The two adults and two children inside the home made it out safely according to fire officials.

When crews arrived they found smoke coming from the two-story home's roof.

Dominion Energy crews were called to turn off the power to the home as flames near the electrical panel added a layer of difficulty for crews because of live wires officials said.

Additional crews responded so that teams of firefighters could simultaneously work to extinguish flames on the first and second floor.

No injuries were reported.

The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

A professional boxer who suffered a punctured lung when he was stabbed has spoken out about the attack which 'nearly ended' his life. Kaash Johnson from Shelton was attacked in Barracks Road in Newcastle-under-Lyme in June 2021 and spent nine days in intensive care after losing a litre of blood.

The 23-year-old had spent the evening at a friend's house watching football before going to meet his sister. He says he was confronted by a group outside Domino's and stabbed during the disturbance that followed.

Now Patrick Jamieson formerly of Basford has this week been jailed for his part in the attack which left Kaash and a second man with stab wounds.

After the attack Kaash feared he might never box again but he defied medics and returned to training just 12 weeks after leaving hospital. He returned to the ring in October this year at the King's Hall in Stoke for a comeback fight against Lee Connelly.

Kaash said: ""I went to pick up my sister from Newcastle and I was confronted by a group of lads outside Domino's. They knew who I was because of the boxing and they were giving me abuse. I went on to be assaulted and ended up getting stabbed.

""I had massive damage to my chest and back and a punctured lung. I was in intensive care for nine days. At first I was really depressed and didn't think I would box again. I didn't even want to do it again.

""I was very up and down. I was bedbound but I believe in mentality over everything. You don't get anything out of life unless you work for it.""

(Image: STOKE SENTINEL)

Kaash who had been dreaming of becoming a professional boxer since he was 11 years old started running again four months after leaving hospital and found he struggled to run a mile. But he has fought back to reach full fitness physically and mentally.

He added: ""I was told that I should not even think about being back in a gym for six months but 12 weeks after coming out of hospital I pulled myself together and went for it. I was down to nothing and was really weak. My fitness had completely gone but I had one dream to get back to boxing.

""I started to run again four months after coming out of hospital and I couldn't even run a mile. Now I can do six miles in 37 minutes. I feel fully recovered. I feel fit and strong - and mentally I feel brilliant. Training is the best thing for my mental health and I wake up feeling blessed every day.""

Kaash now goes into schools and youth clubs to talk to youngsters about the dangers of knife crime as part of his Evade The Blade campaign.

He added: ""Knives are serious weapons that can tear people's lives apart. Children and young people should never be contemplating picking up a knife. It didn't just affect me; my family had to go through it too.

""I feel sorry for the people who did this to me. They must lead sad lives and have a sad mentality to be able to do this. I feel quite proud because they have made me a better person; they have made me the man I am today.

""I was just picking up my sister that night. I wasn't out drinking or looking for trouble. It nearly ended my life. I lost a litre of blood and was lucky to survive. But I am here to tell the story and I don't want what happened to me to be for nothing.""

Nearly 80 Kaua‘i homes may share an unwelcome houseguest this holiday season: “Black slime.”

In some cases the sticky smelly gunk has clotted their showerheads faucets and toilets for more than three years.

Island and state news outlets first reported on the slime-filled households located in the Ho‘oluana at Kohea Lea development in Hanamāʻulu in November and December of 2021. Now one year later the dispute-resolution process between affected residents and the United States’ largest homebuilder D.R. Horton has advanced – incrementally.

“This has been a very long and arduous process” Ho‘oluana homeowner Christie Volkmer said. “We have now spent approximately two years relying on bottled water for drinking cooking brushing our teeth and more. However we are stuck with showering in our contaminated water which we must also use for other necessary things like washing dishes and laundry.”

Volkmer’s family moved into their newly constructed house on Amo Street in May 2018 when Ho‘oluana homes ranged from $440000 to $642663 according to a local real estate blog. The home prices were nearing the million-dollar mark earlier this year.

The Volkmers discovered black slime dripping from their faucets in late 2020 after a three-month absence from their home. Since then they have been unable to rid their home of the sludge-like material which keeps coming back despite regular cleanings.

And they’re not the only ones: Multiple neighbors reported much of the same to their local newspaper in December 2021. Many also shared similar stories of chronic health conditions – including ear and skin infections sores and yeast infections – they believed are linked to the black slime.

The Volkmers and others say nationwide developer D.R. Horton has failed to provide a valid solution to their predicament which they believe stems from contaminated plumbing installed by the Fortune 500 company headquartered in Arlington Texas.

But D.R. Horton which began construction of the Ho‘oluana development in 2017 has denied responsibility – prompting homeowners like the Volkmers to enter a lengthy three-step dispute-resolution process mandated by D.R. Horton’s home-purchase contract.

“It’s definitely a very emotionally-charging situation as it’s not only an immense daily inconvenience but also a financial burden with accruing legal fees” Volkmer said.

The Volkmers and neighboring couples Lani Saiki/Matt Woods and Linda Sprengeler/Tim Harris are among the families who’ve completed the negotiation and mediation phases of the dispute-resolution process. They’re now preparing to enter the final phase arbitration.

Volkmer could not comment on the specifics of the arbitration process which will occur before a judge as early as sometime in the first quarter of 2023. Her attorney former associate justice of the Hawai‘i Supreme Court Robert G. Klein did not immediately return Kaua‘i Now’s calls.

Saiki Woods Sprengeler and Harris declined to speak to Kaua‘i Now for this story following the advice of their attorneys. However they have been outspoken in the past. Last year Sprengeler and Harris launched a GoFundMe campaign on behalf of affected homeowners which they hoped would help defray legal costs necessary to pursue arbitration. The effort has resulted in nearly $17000 in donations to date but that’s far short of the campaign’s $800000 goal.

The Sprengelers also conducted a door-to-door survey of all 151 homes in the Ho‘oluana development following the appearance of black slime in their own house. They found a total of 78 households reported black slime contamination.

“I’m particularly distraught over the fact there many more families in our neighborhood with our same awful issue but they cannot afford the legal battle” Volkmer said. “I find that very sad and wrong.

“It’s been tough for a lot of people lately with COVID-19 and its repercussions and this is just almost too much for some. Clean drinking water especially in a new construction home shouldn’t be something you have to fight for.”

This isn’t the first time homebuyers have called out D.R. Horton which also builds under the brands Emerald Homes Express Homes and Freedom Homes.

The company which reported $3.348 billion in revenues last fiscal year is facing a class action lawsuit in first-circuit court on O‘ahu. Plaintiffs in the case claim D.R. Horton installed defective hurricane straps and steel sill tracks in their homes’ wind-resisting systems and that the hurricane straps and steel sill tracks are corroding.

In 2005 D.R. Horton agreed to pay $39.5 million to the owners of a Colorado condominium complex beset with cracked foundations cracked walls and poor land drainage. It was the largest settlement of a residential construction-defects lawsuit in Colorado history The Denver Post reported at the time.

A nationwide ABC News investigation in 2016 revealed D.R. Horton annually set aside $426.4 million at least two years in a row to handle hundreds of construction defect claims in its brand-new homes.

Also in 2016 a federal judge in Miami ruled D.R. Horton engaged in deceptive practices that forced the bankruptcy of a Florida homeowners association. D.R. Horton ultimately shelled out an $11 million settlement according to a local news site.

And just this past week a Baton Rouge newspaper reported the potential expansion of a class-action lawsuit against D.R. Horton in Louisiana where a couple claims the developer built homes unable to withstand their state’s extreme heat. Hundreds more plaintiffs may soon be able to join the case.

“We’re confident we will prevail in court” Volkmer said. “We just want D.R. Horton to do the right thing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL25ldy15b3JrLzIwMjIvMTIvMTgvbGF3c3VpdC1hZ2FpbnN0LWQtci1ob3J0b24tY291bGQtZXhwYW5kLXRvLWNsYXNzLWFjdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,D.R. Horton Lawsuit Could Expand into Class Action,"A Louisiana lawsuit against D.R. Horton the nation’s largest homebuilder could be expanded to a class-action after a series of rulings this month The Advocate of Baton Rouge reported.

A Youngsville Louisiana family sued the homebuilder in state court claiming a home built by the Texas-based company was defectively designed and constructed leading to mold humidity and HVAC issues.

The family’s lawyers — claiming hundreds of homeowners in the state and nationwide have also been harmed by D.R. Horton’s alleged deceptive sales practices — have filed a motion to expand their suit to class-action status for additional plaintiffs to join in their case. The class could reach up to 1000 plaintiffs the outlet reported.

D.R. Horton’s attorneys say the matter belongs in arbitration and have sought to remove the to federal court to argue that position a maneuver the plaintiff’s lawyers say is a stalling tactic.

“D.R. Horton is again trying to delay and conceal the truth about what it is telling prospective homeowners to try and sell houses” Lance Unglesby the family’s lead attorney said in a statement to The Advocate. “D.R. Horton has a history of failing to disclose material information to prospective buyers and using unethical sales tactics. Our clients have told us that D.R. Horton never warned them about humidity issues in their home designs even after D.R. Horton received complaints.”

A Louisiana judge recently issued several discovery rulings in favor of the family broadening the scope of materials the company has to turn over. Attorneys for the plaintiffs claim that D.R. Horton internal documents will show the company employed “deceptive and coercive sales practices” to get people to buy their homes the outlet reported.

“It’s going to have an extraordinary impact on our ability to prove that D.R. Horton manipulated potential homebuyers” Unglesby told The Advocate.

Nevertheless D.R. Horton attorneys say the matter should be in arbitration between the family and the company.

“It very much remains our position that our arbitration is the legally preferred and best forum for a prompt and fair resolution of the plaintiffs’ claims as opposed to court proceedings which typically go on for years” New Orleans attorney James Alcee Brown told the outlet.

The company’s legal issues aren’t limited to Louisiana. For example on the island of Kauai Hawaii dozens of homeowners claim defectively designed and constructed D.R. Horton homes have led to issues with black slime. Some say the slime is responsible for ongoing health problems including ear and skin infections sores and yeast infections.

In 2021 coal production in India reached 800 million tonnes for the first time. Photo: iStock _

India along with China is the world’s largest coal producer consumer and importer. Its own coal production will surpass a billion tonnes by 2025 the annual report of the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted December 16 2022.

Also India’s coal consumption has doubled since 2007 at an annual growth rate of 6 per cent. It is set to continue to be the growth engine of global coal demand Coal 2022: Analysis and forecast to 2025 added.

India and China are also the only two countries globally where there has been an uptick in investment in coal mine assets. This is because domestic production has been ramped up in both countries to reduce external reliance according to IEA.

Read Climate hypocrisy? Germany’s coal-fuelled power sector more polluting than India China currently

Coal’s global phaseout is also nowhere in sight given the demand for it.

“In last year’s annual market report Coal 2021 we said that global coal demand might well reach a new peak in 2022 or 2023 before plateauing thereafter.

“Despite the global energy crisis our overall outlook remains unchanged this year as various factors are offsetting each other” the assessment noted.

End of coal?

The Russian invasion of Ukraine February 24 2022 was one such factor. It “sharply altered the dynamics of coal trade price levels and supply and demand patterns in 2022”.

However this was not the case globally. “In India and China where coal is the backbone of electricity systems and gas accounts for just a fraction of power generation the impact of steeper gas prices on coal demand has been limited” the IEA said.

Nevertheless increased coal use in these countries had replaced some gas which has been purchased by other regions willing to pay more for it it added.

Europe has been hit particularly hard by the Russian invasion of Ukraine due to its reliance on Russian gas. It sparked a surge in gas prices which in turn pushed coal prices up to new records in March and during the summer.

The spike in the prices of gas due to the war as well as lower output from hydro and nuclear led to ‘fuel switching’ to coal in the European Union to generate power.

Still the production of electricity from coal has not been much in most European countries with the exception of Germany.

“Only in Germany with 10 gigawatts is the reversal at a significant scale. This has increased coal power generation in the European Union which is expected to remain at these higher levels for some time” according to the report.

But EU coal generation and demand will return to a downward trajectory as soon as 2024 according to the IEA. This will be due to redoubled efforts to improve energy efficiency and expand renewables.

IEA has also forecast that coal use will maintain its downward trajectory in the United States.

But in China and India the coal bull-run continued this year.

“In China low hydropower output in the summer amid a big heat wave pushed coal power generation significantly higher. In August coal power generation in China increased by around 15 per cent year-on-year to over 500 terawatt-hours (TWh)” according to IEA.

However increase in renewable power generation in China means that growth in coal consumption is expected to remain relatively stagnant at an average of 0.7 per cent a year to 2025.

Global coal demand reached eight billion tonnes this year.

“In our forecast global coal demand plateaus around the 2022 level of 8 billion tonnes through 2025. However given the current energy crisis with all its uncertainties a lurch into growth or contraction is possible” according to the report.

It concluded that “in the absence of low-emissions alternatives that can replace coal at scale in the iron and steel sector in the near term global coal demand is set to remain flat through our forecast period.”

Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance posthumously restored,"J. Robert Oppenheimer has had his security clearance restored nearly 70 years after it was revoked by the Atomic Energy Commission.

Dec. 17 (UPI) -- J. Robert Oppenheimer the theoretical physicist known as ""the father of the atomic bomb"" has had his security clearance posthumously restored U.S. officials announced. The move comes nearly 70 years after Oppenheimer's clearance was revoked by the Atomic Energy Commission during the anti-communist fervor of the mid-1950s led by Sen. Joseph McCarthy. Advertisement

Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm issued the order Friday.

""Today I am pleased to announce the Department of Energy has vacated the Atomic Energy Commission's 1954 decision in the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" she said in a statement.

""As a successor agency to the Atomic Energy Commission the Department of Energy has been entrusted with the responsibility to correct the historical record and honor Dr. Oppenheimer's profound contributions to our national defense and the scientific enterprise at large"" she added.

Oppenheimer had faced allegations of being too close to communists since the 1930s. His wife Kitty's first husband was killed fighting for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in Spain and many of his associates fell under FBI surveillance. The FBI believed that a friend tried to make overtures to Oppenheimer during World War II on behalf of Soviet intelligence but was rebuffed.

Regardless of government suspicions Oppenheimer was given a security clearance to work on America's atomic program in 1943.

During the post-war era however Oppenheimer expressed dismay with the American project to build a thermonuclear ""super"" bomb or hydrogen bomb and was accused of trying to discourage scientists from working on the project.

""If super bombs will work at all there is no inherent limit in the destructive power that may be attained with them. Therefore a super bomb might become a weapon of genocide"" Oppenheimer and other scientists wrote in a 1949 letter to the Atomic Energy Commission.

In 1953 the former head of Congress' Joint Atomic Energy Committee William Liscum Borden wrote a letter to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover alleging without real evidence that Oppenheimer was most likely a Soviet agent.

In December 1953 his security clearance was temporarily revoked and in May 1954 a board of the Atomic Energy Commission voted 2-1 to revoke his clearance permanently.

""In 1954 the Atomic Energy Commission revoked Dr. Oppenheimer's security clearance through a flawed process that violated the Commission's own regulations"" Granholm said in her statement.

""As time has passed more evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country have only been further affirmed"" she asserted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5udXZvLm5ldC9uZXdzL25ld3Mvc3RhdGUtc3RpbGwtc2Vla2luZy1kYXZpZC1sb3R0LWhhcmR5LWNvbnZpY3Rpb24vYXJ0aWNsZV9iNjk1YTZhMC0zZTg4LTUwMzMtOGUyMy0yZDU0MWRhYzg3ZTguYW1wLmh0bWzSAYQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnV2by5uZXQvbmV3cy9uZXdzL3N0YXRlLXN0aWxsLXNlZWtpbmctZGF2aWQtbG90dC1oYXJkeS1jb252aWN0aW9uL2FydGljbGVfYjY5NWE2YTAtM2U4OC01MDMzLThlMjMtMmQ1NDFkYWM4N2U4LmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,State still seeking David Lott Hardy conviction,"By Jacob Rund

An attorney for the former Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission chairman argued Monday that the decision of a Marion County judge to dismiss all charges should be upheld by the Indiana Court of Appeals.

In August 2012 the state filed charges accusing David Lott Hardy of inappropriately assisting an IURC employee and holding secret meetings with Duke Energy executives. Last fall Superior Court Judge William Nelson dismissed the charges and a month later the office of the Attorney General filed a notice appealing the decision.

Hardy held the office of IURC chairman for five years before being fired by former Gov. Mitch Daniels after the discovery of Hardy's alleged misconduct.

During his trial in Marion Superior Court Hardy faced four charges of official misconduct - all class D felonies. The first charge accused Hardy of talking to Duke Energy officials about a job for Scott Storms who was then an IURC administrative law judge working on a case involving construction of a Duke power plant.

The second third and fourth charges claimed illegal acts of secret communication occurred among Hardy and Duke Energy officials between 2008 and 2010. The charges claimed Hardy violated his duty as a public servant by failing to disclose communication with various Duke Energy officials concerning pending proceedings involving the company's Edwardsport facility.

Nelson dismissed the charges against Hardy based on an amendment passed by the Indiana General Assembly to correct a poorly written law.

Before the amendment the law allowed for any violation of procedure - even one noncriminal in nature - to be charged as official misconduct.

After Indiana Inspector General David Thomas filed a report in 2010 noting problems with the legislation lawmakers quickly refined it to only include criminal behavior.

On Monday a panel of three Appeals Court judges - Cale Bradford Paul Mathias and Rudolph Pyle III - heard oral arguments from attorneys for both sides.

The Appeals Court could either uphold the ruling of the Marion County Superior Court dismissing all charges or it could side with the state sending the case back to trial. No matter the outcome both sides still have the option of appealing the case to the Indiana Supreme Court.

The main question at hand is whether the amendment - which became effective in the summer of 2012 - could be viewed as retroactive and would then include Hardy's alleged violations during 2008-2010.

David Hensel Hardy's defense attorney argued the amendment is indeed retroactive and should lead to the subsequent dismissal of all charges.

Hensel pointed to the timely manner in which the legislature responded to the report of loose language in the law by the Inspector General as a main reason why the amendment should also apply to Hardy's situation.

""The speed... that seems to be the critical factor"" he said. ""The speed at which the legislature responds to notification of a defect in the law and a request to remedy that defect.""

Hensel also cited a previous court ruling that contained language naming the speed of response by the legislature to a problem with a law as a determining factor of the lawmaker's original intent.

Ellen Meilaender a deputy attorney general representing the state argued there is no evidence that the General Assembly intended for the amendment to be retroactive.

""There is no evidence clearly showing an implicit intent by the legislature for retroactive application; in fact the evidence supports the opposite conclusion"" said Meilaender in a written argument.

Also in her written argument Meilaender denounced the defendant's reasoning that the change by the legislature constitutes lawmakers' belief that the law is ""defective.""

""The fact that the Inspector General asked the legislature to ""clarify"" the law does not prove that the legislature agreed that the statute was defective as opposed to just a decision that the legislature no longer like the reach of the statute"" she said.

Following Monday's Appeals Court hearing Attorney General Greg Zoeller issued a statement affirming his belief that Hardy should be held accountable for his actions.

""For the public to have confidence in our laws there must be public accountability; and individuals who hold positions of public trust ought to be held to a very high standard"" said Zoeller. ""My office working with the prosecutor maintains that the official misconduct statute that was on the books in 2010 should be enforce against this defendant since the legislature when it changed the law in 2012 did not make the change retroactive.""

The Appeals Court will now deliberate on the case and a ruling is expected within the next few months.

(Port City Daily/Shea Carver)

NEW HANOVER COUNTY — A popular dog park is getting an upgrade for more pups and their humans to enjoy the green space at night.

New Hanover County is extending the hours at the dog park located at Long Leaf Park (314 Pine Grove Dr.). Open 8 a.m. to sunset once Duke Energy installs lighting closing time will be 10 p.m. Added lighting will strengthen safety measures during the park’s later hours.

“Because of the dog park’s popularity and heavy use we have received requests for lighting to make the park usable in the evening” county parks and gardens assistant director Andy Johnson said.

The county estimates hundreds of people use the park daily.

Duke Energy will install three perimeter light poles for a total of four LED lights. According to Johnson estimated monthly utility lighting charges are expected to be around $180 for the additional lights. The county is paying $2000 in upfront costs.

“Due to the dense pine tree population inside the dog park lighting coverage will not be 100% but will be adequate for evening use” Johnson added.

No trees are planned for removal to make way for the project. Installation likely will not be complete until February according to internal emails.

The dog park allows for off-leash activity within two fenced-in areas — one for smaller pups and another for larger dogs. Otherwise canines must be leashed at all times in the park if not a designated area.

Long Leaf Park recently received additional upgrades per community request. Fitness stations similar to its ninja warrior course and adult basketball courts were added.

The French Top 14 leaders ran in six tries including two from scrum-half Antoine Dupont and a penalty try.

Thibaud Flament Cyril Baille Lucas Tauzin and Romain Ntamack crossed for Toulouse who had Thomas Ramos sent off for a headbutt late on.

Bevan Rodd Akker van der Merwe and Jonny Hill scored Sale's three tries.

Sharks who had claimed a 39-0 win over Ulster in their first match in the competition were ahead early thanks to great skill from Rodd with the England international prop hacking on before falling on the ball over the line.

But the hosts hit back quickly with three tries before 20 minutes had passed.

Lock Flament sliced through the Sale defence to go under the posts prop Baille then bundled his way over for a score upheld after a TMO review and Dupont had his first after a superb move where the ball travelled through several pairs of Toulouse hands.

Sale improved in the latter part of the first half including a spell where they denied Toulouse any points despite having van der Merwe sin-binned.

After his return the South African hooker barged over from a line-out for Sale's second try.

Toulouse stretched ahead just after half-time when a penalty try was awarded when Sale's Byron McGuigan caught Ramos around the head and neck just as the French full-back was attempting to touch down a kick and chase over the line.

Dupont's pace saw him outrun Sale's Rob du Preez to reach a kick ahead for his second try soon after while Tauzin scored in the corner after another slick move by the hosts.

Ntamack then stepped through four tackles for another converted try before a chaotic finale that included a red card for Ramos.

McGuigan was convinced he had scored just before the end but after the ball came loose in the act of touching down Toulouse raced downfield to score through Matthis Lebel.

Replays though showed Ramos had headbutted McGuigan in the aftermath of the disputed Sale try and was dismissed. The visitors still had time to notch a third try through lock Hill.

Toulouse have two wins out of two in Pool B and visit Sale for the return tie on 14 January.",,,,,,,,,

Goldfinger had its London world premiere on this day in 1964. Blackman relished the role and her character's ridiculously rude name declaring: ""It's very much tongue-in-cheek isn't it? I mean if you're so po-faced that you have to take that seriously well bad luck."" Shocked that studio executives had problems with the name especially in America Honor revealed: ""I used to quite deliberately say 'Oh you mean Pussy?' And they used to die."" But she was always serious when it mattered and made sure she was never merely eye candy in any role. A tough upbringing and a TV and film career decades ahead of today's Hollywood action women made the actress a truly groundbreaking screen siren unafraid to speak her mind. This is the woman who said: ""Most of the Bond girls have been bimbos. I have never been a bimbo.""

Goldfinger contains one of the most gratuitous uses of the female body on screen even by Bond standards when Shirley Eaton was painted gold. It also introduced a revolutionary leading lady who was not there simply to service the leading man and who was more than his match whether in wits or fighting skills. In an industry then and now when actors regularly have love interests who are considerably younger Honor was 39 when the film was released – and five years older than Connery. Film posters showed her standing over him holding a gun clearly in charge. Honor even laughed at the stunt scenes having faced far tougher in her breakthrough role in The Avengers. Although that didn't stop her from sustaining a ""disgusting"" injury.

Honor Blackman and Sean Connery on the Goldfinger set

Taught to box as a girl by her father Honor played action hero Avenger Cathy Gale from 1962-1964 and learned martial arts in a basement dojo under judo practitioners and stuntmen Joe and Doug Robinson. TV shoots were far less pampered than film ones and so when it came time for the infamous physical tussle between Bond and Pussy in the barn the actress had faced far tougher tasks. Honor said 'When we did the fight - the 'so-called fight’ - I'd been used to doing judo in the studio on cement. So they had banks and banks of straw and they said 'Will that be alright? Can you land? Will you be safe?' I mean it was luxury for me."" Even so fighting with 6'2 Connery took its toll. DON'T MISS

The actress said: ""Of course I fancied Sean he was the sexiest man I’ve ever met. He was Mr Universe with a body to die for had those twinkly eyes and was great fun. Yes if I hadn’t been married I would have gone there."" While many have criticised Bond's character over the years Honor blasted the actor in 2012 over revelations he had 'only' paid £3.9million in taxes in the previous 15 years. She said: ""I disapprove of him strongly now... Because I don't think you should accept a title from a country and then pay absolutely no tax towards it. He wants it both ways. I don't think his principles are very high"".

Honor Blackman in 1960

While Connery had accepted his knighthood Honor declined a CBE in 2002. Raised by a domineering and disciplinarian father a World War I veteran who beat Honor and her three siblings with a leather strap she admitted it took time to be able to speak her own mind. Honor said: ""My parents had Victorian values and so the man was always right. It took me ages to work out men don't always make the right decisions. I mean instinct told me early on it wasn't the case but it took me a long time to argue back."" She said she left home at 18 after her father hit her for wearing lipstick and she hit him back.

Agree with it or not the death penalty is a well-established part of American history — and for a lot of that history the nation's most infamous death row was at San Quentin. And it's been that way for a long long time — the first prisoner execution took place in 1893.

In 2022 the Los Angeles Times reported that the 737 inmates being held there were going to be slowly moved to other facilities across the country as the state of California was rethinking their stance on the death penalty. At the time it had been 16 years since an execution and those living on death row were existing in a weird sort of limbo.

While the death penalty has always been incredibly polarizing for those on the outside for those inside it's just as real as the walls and the wire that surround them. And here's the thing: U.S. citizens had been condemning people to death long before the idea was formalized into law with newspapers documenting cases where angry mobs simply dragged an accused to a conveniently-located tree and strung 'em up. Those were the heady days of the mid- to late 19th century when a hangin' was an afternoon event. Something to watch.

Those days passed into something less public but no less chilling — so let's look at some snapshots of one of America's most notorious prisons."

Known as Radio H-P this online members' club is like a posh Gumtree — a website which allows its well-heeled members to discreetly sell houses animals and silver candlesticks to one another as well as finding staff and suitably smart holiday rentals.

A few weeks ago tickets for an afternoon spent Christmas decorating with Michelle Dockery (otherwise known as Lady Mary from Downton Abbey) were advertised

Founded in 2015 by Nigel Haddon-Paton 69 a charming and impeccably dressed former major in the Household Cavalry regiment Blues and Royals it's become a much-loved resource by all those who use it. And it's particularly handy at this time of year when posh people do their Christmas shopping.

Because dukes and countesses couldn't possibly venture on to Oxford Street or browse anywhere as common as eBay. Instead they look to Radio H-P where current Christmas presents on offer include signed lithographs of Balmoral and Sandringham by King Charles (from £6000) an antique snooker table (from £6900) and a used mini Land Rover for children (£2700).

There was particular excitement a few weeks ago when tickets for an afternoon spent Christmas decorating with Michelle Dockery (otherwise known as Lady Mary from Downton Abbey) were advertised though it's unclear whether the actress herself is part of the H-P community.

Current Christmas presents on offer include signed lithographs of Balmoral and Sandringham by King Charles (from £6000)

No doubt at this point you're wondering how you gain access to Radio H-P. Well it's tricky. Very tricky. It's not like signing up to Facebook. They don't let any old riff-raff in. As with old-school gentleman's clubs you have to be proposed by someone who's already a user and seconded by another user (these two people can't be related).

These proposers and seconders fill out a testimonial form illustrating that person's 'character' and 'what you think they might bring to the Radio H-P community'.

Whoever is being put forward then has to provide a potted CV of their education and career. Every single application is read by Nigel himself.

Nigel Hadden-Paton was inspired to set up Radio H-P thanks to his very smart friends asking him for help to sell whippet puppies or rent their house in the South of France. And so eight years ago he launched a website to connect those in his address book with others who wanted a whippet or a week in Provence. He dubbed it Radio H-P after his surname and it's grown ever since.

Known as Radio H-P this online members' club is like a posh Gumtree — a website which allows its well-heeled members to discreetly sell houses animals and silver candlesticks to one another

Today he says his website is 'not only considered the friendliest network on the internet but a much sought after resource to reach an influential target market for selling or publicising almost anything.'

Nigel who lives in Dorset with his wife and has four children — one of whom is the actor Harry who played Martin Charteris in the first two series of The Crown — is an entrepreneurial sort.

He's also a truffle salesman who runs a separate website called Truffle UK. It sells tree saplings imported from France Italy and Croatia and infused with truffle spores which ideally later sprout truffles themselves. The late Duke of Edinburgh was a client.

With these sort of connections then it's perhaps no surprise to hear that the 11000 members of Radio H-P are largely made up of extremely grand types: dukes earls countesses lords and ladies the odd celebrity and Sloaney sorts ranging in age from 18 upwards. While some members live all over the world the main clientele are mostly British.

My mother and I are both members and we text the funniest adverts to one another.

Recently she sent me a post offering members the chance to recycle their 'family gold' and turn it into signet rings. Since I'm thinking about getting a dog she also sends me the puppy postings.

One member is currently advertising a litter of basset hound puppies ('bred through French and Irish lines') and I was quite tempted by the photos of the pups peering sweetly over their dog bed. At least you know you're not buying from a puppy farm here.

It's also terrific people-watching because underneath every advert is the name of the person who posted it so I often spot one and think 'Oh look the Duke of So-and-So is selling his old Defender.'

Last month I learned that a friend was pregnant only when I saw her advert on the site looking for a bigger rental house in Chelsea.

Indeed a good number of the members know each other in real life and would wave to one another at Royal Ascot or on the Eton playing field as they watch their son in a rugby match which is exactly why they like Radio H-P: it's a safe space. You can rent someone's house in Puglia or their chalet in Verbier knowing you're not about to be conned.

That said there can be hiccups: this summer I bought a swanky second-hand Fisher & Paykel cooker for £1000 from another member and arranged delivery only for the seller to ring very apologetically on the day ('I'm so terribly sorry') confessing that her husband had sold it to another member who'd already got the cooker upstairs and installed in her Maida Vale flat.

The daredevil's toboggan is available for £2500 and is decorated with the Scottish saltire

But my money was returned immediately and I never worried at any point that I'd been 'had'.

Similarly I recently spotted a splendid testimonial written by a Radio H-P member lamenting that having arrived on holiday in Antigua she discovered the house they'd rented was 'awful' but that thanks to Radio H-P she was able to rent another 'thank goodness!'

For the anointed few once you're a member you can either log on to the site to browse the adverts or sign up for a twice-daily email listing the new postings dubbed 'Morning Post' and 'Evening Post' with every email you receive signed off 'Love and best wishes Nigel'.

If you want to sell something say an antique chest of drawers or a house in Gloucestershire you have to pay the website a fee which depends on the cost of the item plus a commission from the sale. If you like the look of something you simply click on the advert and then message the seller.

But you have to be quick. Earlier this year I spied a beautiful wooden bath for sale — a bargain at a few hundred pounds — and immediately messaged the seller since I was doing up my bathroom at the time. Alas it had sold within minutes.

Although the idea of a posh private online club may enrage class warriors and it's all too easy to poke fun of Radio H-P does a lot of good too. Last month one user posted about trying to find a blood stem cell donor for a young relative with leukaemia. It offers tickets to charitable events and helps members find trustworthy carers for their elderly parents or drivers who can take relatives to hospital and back.

As Nigel himself says it has 'old-fashioned values that make Radio H-P a watchword for reliability and good behaviour in business and contribute to [its members'] growing sense of community.'

So what kind of treasures can you find on Radio H-P? Aside from royal lithographs by His Majesty here's the current best of crop. Just don't tell anyone I showed you . . .

BEST OF PETS FOR THE SWISHIEST HOMES

Six Kennel Club-registered French bulldogs are available for £2000 each

A 'sweet and loving' pony called Breeze is being offered for £4500. She's grey very well-behaved 'likes hunting and games' and would make the perfect present for a small child. Pick up from Northumberland.

Or why not surprise the family with a Kennel Club-registered French bulldog on Christmas Day? Three boys and three girls are available £2000 each they've been wormed and have had their first vaccine.

Members also often advertise for male or female dogs to breed with theirs. Tragically I always find these adverts extremely funny. 'Bilbo seeks a babe' says one current post going on to explain that the member is keen to breed her Shih Tzu Bilbo with another dog because she'd 'love to have one of his puppies'.

SLIDE INTO THE POSHEST OF TOBOGGONS

One of my favourite adverts ever on this site a member is selling his Cresta Run toboggan. The Cresta Run is the very exclusive and very icy slope in St Moritz Switzerland which European Royalty and British toffs have been flinging themselves down since it was built in 1884.

This daredevil's toboggan is available for £2500 and is decorated with the Scottish saltire.

'The Cresta run has always been known as the best thrill you can have with your clothes on and here is the means to achieve it' promises his advertisement.

TIME TO BUY YOURSELF A NEW BENTLEY?

One member is currently flogging his blue Bentley which has walnut veneers and heated seats. It's a snip at £35000.

Another declares 'For the person who has everything' in his advert offering a 2007 black cab with nearly 400000 miles on the clock air-con and a top speed of 70mph. 'I bought it to drive to Germany and back and now it is ready for its next adventure' says the double-barrelled member from Chelsea.

COUNTRY MANSIONS TO A CHIC PIED A TERRE

Property is often advertised on the site because you can sell directly to another member without having to deal with an oily estate agent.

Right now you can pick up a sensationally beautiful seven- bedroom Georgian house in Dorset if you have a spare £2 million knocking around. Built in the 1780s it has an adjacent paddock and a separate two- bedroom cottage.

Or why not buy a luxury penthouse in Lisbon — solid oak floors marble terrace walnut staircase and three bedrooms for just €4 million (£3.4 million).

TRUSTED HOUSEKEEPER OR A CHALET HOST

Nannying jobs as well as PA roles and live-in caring jobs are regularly posted on Radio H-P because it's a trusted network where you're more likely to find someone brilliant than using a dubious or expensive agency. A housekeeper is currently required for the Cotswolds (must be able to cook 'to dinner party standard') and various chalet hosts are naturally needed for chalets across the Alps as the winter ski season kicks off.

LUXE HOLIDAYS FOR THOSE IN THE KNOW

Renting your nine-bedroom house on Radio H-P is popular because its membership is so select you won't (hopefully) come home to a place trashed by plebs a la Airbnb. And the prices are competitive too.

'Escape the cold and dark — come to Cape Town!' says a recent post offering a pretty wooden three-bedroom house in the South African city for £1500 a week. Other holiday homes currently on offer are in Sri Lanka Morocco and Botswana.

Or you could opt for 'a slice of heaven' in Kenya over New Year and spend £3300 a week renting this member's house on the coast which comes with five staff including a 'superb' chef.

ONLY ONE PLACE TO BUY YOUR FOIE GRAS...

'Although avian flu has made it difficult to source this year I do have a small quantity of delicious foie gras' writes one member who imports the delicacy from France. Prices from £32 and 'fig raspberry and truffle condiments are available' to go with it. 'I also have some wonderful highly alcoholic cherries that make the perfect present' adds the member. Delicious."

I chose the Charger because it’s an American car and there are few things more American than car culture. Interesting then that British developer Criterion is back in the driver’s seat for Unbound. From its characters to the ideas it deals with to the city of Lakeshore and even how it plays Unbound is a remarkably American game.

Recommended Videos

And like the Charger I picked at the start it’s a good but not quite great foray into car racing. When it works Unbound is like a well-maintained car: absolutely joyous fun to drive around in and a great way to explore a wide world. But like a classic car it’s got tons of little issues that crop up from time to time and how well you deal with those issues will determine how well you and Unbound get along.

What makes Unbound great doesn’t start with a car. It starts with the character you create. Once you’ve chosen from one of the available presets you can wade into a relatively deep customization suite choosing from a wide variety of clothing options including several prominent brands like Vans and having the ability to tweak hair and facial features among other things.

Once you’ve made your driver and you’ve got your car Unbound throws you into Lakeshore a fictional U.S. city built on the foundation of Chicago Illinois. The story finds your character working at Rydell’s Rydes a garage with a connection to the local racing scene with your friend Yaz. The two of you both the products of foster homes are looking into the local racing scene and have fixed up the car of your choice to do so under the mentorship of Rydell.

The characters are well-written and acted. Yours is low-key and just wants to race. Yaz is a gearhead and the more ambitious (and ruthless) of the two. Rydell is a former racer now-garage owner mentoring you to win “the right way.” Naturally these personalities conflict and cause problems and Unbound’s storyline is surprisingly compelling.

Unbound’s punk rock cel-shaded graffiti-style doesn’t hurt either. Street racing is inherently rebellious and Unbound leans into that energy with every part of its art design from the way characters look to the graffiti-styled visual effects that appear around cars when you boost drift or hit jumps. The game’s background storytelling emphasizes this style too openly mocking the tough-on-crime stance of Lakeshore’s mayor her challenger’s incompetence the town’s cops and everything else that doesn’t square with the game’s anti-establishment vibe.

Some people may be thrown off by the characters who are almost all Zoomers and act appropriately but I thought the kids were alright and enjoyed spending time with them and the world Criterion has built.

That’s good because you’ll be spending a lot of time in Lakeshore. Unbound is a combination of Need for Speed: Most Wanted Burnout Paradise and Need for Speed Underground. Lakeshore is an open-world. You can engage with plenty of challenges scattered throughout the world — like hitting big jumps running through speed traps achieving top speeds and breaking collectibles — but the real draw is the meetups which lead to Unbound‘s races.

Unbound has a variety of meetups: street races off road races drift challenges and takeover events so there’s plenty to do. The trick is that in true street racing fashion most of it requires a buy-in. You’ll earn money (and sometimes cars) based on how well you place so each race is a risk. You can restart if you lose but Unbound limits you to a certain number of restarts each day so you’ll want to use them wisely.

Racing also builds Heat which attracts cops who want nothing more than to put degenerates like you in jail and take your hard-earned cash. Cops will chase you during races and often after them as well so being able to get away is important. You can knock them out by damaging them but running away works too. As you attract more Heat the police presence escalates appropriately seeing the 5-0 sending better cars and helicopters to bust you. If you do get busted you’ll lose any money you haven’t banked.

Money can buy new clothes and style upgrades for your ride including new body styles paint jobs and designs but you’ll probably want to spend it on what’s under the hood first. Car are ranked by class from B to S+ and upgrading parts boosts that level appropriately. Events only allow cars of specific ratings so you’ll want to choose the right car for the job before heading out as you can’t change your choice until you head back to a safehouse which advances time from day to night and then to the next day. Heat you gain is carried over at night as well but the rewards are generally better too.

Choosing the right events managing how much heat you want to accrue and being smart with how much money you put up is all part of Unbound’s risk reward. It gives every race stakes; it feels terrible to lose some of the cash you worked so hard to get but pulling off big wins feels fantastic especially if you don’t have any restarts left. And as long as you’re making cash it doesn’t matter if you place first.

The driving in Unbound feels fantastic and you’re allowed an enormous amount of freedom to customize your car. In addition to the parts you can buy you can customize your tuning emphasizing things like upforce and downforce or drift and grip. Each has its own pros and cons and each car has its own natural strengths and weaknesses.

Better still cars feel noticeably different when you install new parts and play with the tuning so you can get an enormously different experience just playing with a few cars. How you build your cars and the level of risk you want to take matters a lot and it’s good that Unbound offers this level of freedom. When you build your car right and race it properly — hitting your drifts outmaneuvering cop cars timing your boosts well — it feels amazing.

Unfortunately that road excellence and Unbound’s strong structure also highlights its problems. It can be hard to win money if you don’t have a good car because you’re limited to certain races and you won’t be carried by upgrades alone. Similarly it can be hard to earn money if you don’t already have any money because you’re limited to races with low or no-cost buy-ins and losing costs you what little you might have. That’s particularly annoying if you get to qualifier day and don’t have enough money to enter.

Image via Electronic Arts

Unbound gets around this problem by allowing you to replay the previous day as much as you’d like to earn the money you need but the issue is sitting through every bit of dialogue you’ve already heard. Sitting through the same day multiple times gets old quickly.

But the real issue is Unbound’s rubberbanding. You can get good distance on the competition but if the AI is supposed to be doing well it doesn’t matter if it’s crashed into a dozen things and you’re on a straight-away at max speed. if an opponent is “supposed” to be ahead of you they’ll find a way to get unrealistically close or even surpass you.

Rubberbanding is bad enough when you’re racing well but it’s nearly impossible to deal with if you make a mistake. This problem is magnified during qualifier races where you only have so many restarts and you simply lose because the game has decided that’s how it’s going to be. Turning down the difficulty doesn’t help either. It’s a shame because Unbound’s racing feels fantastic when the AI doesn’t get in the way.

There is an online component to Unbound and it’s a pretty enjoyable mix of the stuff you’ll see in the single-player. Unfortunately what you you unlock in single-player doesn’t transfer over to the multiplayer component so you’re essentially starting from scratch once you get online.

Need for Speed Unbound — The Bottom Line

Image via Electronic Arts

Pros

A compelling story with interesting characters.

Stylish visual design emphasizes the game’s punk rock vibe.

Driving feels fantastic and there are tons of ways to tune your car.

Cons

Rubberband AI can makes races feel unfair.

Can be harder to get much-needed cash when you don’t have any.

Limited restarts are a source of frustration especially during qualifier events.

When Unbound works it’s like driving a gorgeous humming sports car. When it doesn’t it’s like driving a rental with a rough-running engine. That doesn’t mean it isn’t worth the ride but it does mean a few spots could use a tune up to make this road trip smoother.

Dec. 16 Quick Takes: At long last FDA approves Ferring’s Adstiladrin Plus: Lilly Sosei in small molecule discovery deal and updates from WuXi Biologics Avidity Natera ABio Synaptogenix and more

Adstiladrin nadofaragene firadenovec from Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S will be commercially available in the U.S. in 2H23 following its approval by on Friday more than two years after CMC issues led the agency to issue a complete response letter (CRL). The approval comes two months after Ferring assumed control of FerGene Inc the entity it set up in 2019 with Blackstone Life Sciences to commercialize the non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) treatment. Adstiladrin comprises an intravesically administered non-replicating adenovirus which engages the biosynthesis of interferon alfa-2b protein in the bladder.

Lincoln Riley came in last year and landed a ton of high-profile names with Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams and Oregon star RB Travis Dye as a couple of them not to mention Jordan Addison.

Before we continue with this story let’s make one point clear: Pursuing a Mid-American Conference transfer might not seem like that big a deal. The MAC is not stuffed with high-end talent. However you might remember that Central Michigan offensive lineman Eric Fisher was the No. 1 pick in the 2013 NFL Draft and he is still in the league a decade later. He has had a very good career and he’s a MAC product.

A conference doesn’t have to be 10 or 20 deep in talent. Just getting one key prospect from a smaller conference can change everything.

Now let’s continue with our story:

This year should be more of the same for USC in terms of raiding the transfer portal. The Trojans are wasting no time trying to add talent to the roster. This weekend Western Michigan defensive standout Braden Fiske will be taking a visit to USC as the Trojans continue to shore up the defensive side of the ball (h/t TrojanSeij).

Former Western Michigan's Braden Fiske will visit USC this weekend. One of the most sought after in the Portal. He had 148 tackles 27.5 tackles for loss and 13.5 sacks across his career. 👀✌️ pic.twitter.com/r7TY4StlEQ — TrojanSeij ✌️ (@TrojanSeijo) December 16 2022

The Trojans already landed in the top three for Coastal Carolina transfer LB Josaiah Stewart and they got good news when Shane Lee announced he would return to L.A. for his final year of college football.

Alex Grinch and Lincoln Riley need to prioritize getting help on defense especially after a brutal ending to the season despite having one of the best offenses in college football which included the Heisman Trophy winner at quarterback.

Fiske is a popular name in the portal and he is fresh off as a visit to Florida State. In 2022 he finished the year with 57 tackles 10.5 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks so his presence in L.A. would be a tremendous addition.

It features virtually all of Tesla’s home energy products.

Lately Tesla has been increasingly relying on third-party installers to deploy its home energy products.

Instead of managing the installation Tesla is gradually becoming more of a supplier with its goal of owning the home energy ecosystem through products like the Powerwall.

This is going to allow Tesla to focus on manufacturing and scale with the goal of supporting its new ‘Tesla Electric‘ electricity retailing product.

One of those third-party installers is Good Faith Energy based in Texas. They have been doing some of the most impressive Tesla Solar Roof installations we have seen.

We reported on them last year after they showed how one of their Tesla Solar Roof installations fared against a hailstorm with baseball-size hailstones.

Now we are featuring one of their latest projects in Katy Texas where they helped builder William David Homes build the ultimate Tesla house.

Good Faith Energy installed an impressive 11000 sq-ft Tesla Solar Roof with a capacity of 30 kW.

As you can see it’s a big house but not the entire roof needs to be equipped with solar tiles producing electricity.

Tesla supplies both solar and non-solar tiles for its solar roof installations and the solar tiles are installed to optimize the house’s electricity production based on orientation and shade.

Here’s the particular solar tile configuration for this project:

Each Tesla solar tile is about 45in by 14in and is rated at 72w. They give more flexibility than the usual solar panel. Jim Abercrombie Director of Roofing Operations at Good Faith Energy says that five tiles which adds up to 360w cover about the same square footage of most 360w solar panels.

But to be the ultimate Tesla house you can’t only have a Tesla Solar Roof.

This project has virtually all of Tesla’s energy products and a lot of them.

It is also equipped with 5 Tesla Powerwalls – providing up to 67.5 kWh of backup power.

The house is also equipped with 3 of Tesla’s 7.6 kW solar inverters – the company’s most recent solar product looking to compete with industry leaders like Enphase and Solar Edge.

The Tesla solar tiles also give the house a very unique look:

Now as for what everyone wants to know about: the price.

It has become harder to get pricing on Tesla’s Solar Roof. The company doesn’t provide online estimates anymore. Pricing varies greatly depending on roof complexity.

I asked Good Faith Energy about it and Mohammed Abdalla CEO of Good Faith Energy said:

“The price of the Tesla Solar Roof varies quite dramatically based on a variety of factors including: Size of the roof complexity of the roof amount of PV or producing tiles and the number of batteries. A roof with 4 planes can come in much lower in price than a similar sized house that is covered with ridges valleys turrets and odd and complex shapes. In 2022 on average our Tesla Solar Roof pricing came in between $35-$50/sqft before the federal solar tax credit (assuming you qualify). This is about the cost of a luxury roof like slate or tile plus the cost of a solar system added in. It isn’t just a roof and it isn’t just a solar system. It is the only roof that looks this good and can cover your electricity bill forever.”

Based on the $35-$50/sqft estimate and the 11000 sqft of this project we can estimate between $385000 and $550000.

That sounds like a lot but again it needs to be compared with other luxury roof options like slates and tiles and the cost of an equivalent 30 kW solar power system. This can’t be compared to a roof made of asphalt shingles.

We are also talking about multi-million dollar new build here.

BATON ROUGE - An unexplained power outage downtown has left the Louisiana Art & Science Museum in the dark for nearly 48 hours.

Officials said the power first went out at LASM and surrounding buildings around 3 p.m. Thursday. Entergy reportedly told museum staff their power would be back on by that night.

As of Saturday evening the museum is still in the dark.

Entergy officials told WBRZ Saturday they discovered the outage was caused by an underground cable fault and the problem is isolated to the museum.

Entergy provided several generators in an attempt to restore power temporarily but they weren't enough to fire up the entire facility according to museum staff. Crews are out working Saturday evening to hopefully repair the cable and get the building switched back to utility power.

LASM has postponed their fourth annual ""A Very Merry Museum"" event originally scheduled for 10 a.m. Saturday and the museum will remain closed until further notice due to the outage.

While waiting to get their power back museum officials say they still hosted nearly 300 students Friday from across the state for ""educational hands-on activities and tours.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here Are 3 Top Stocks to Buy Now.,"Oil prices might be down but several catalysts could push crude higher in the coming year.

Crude oil prices started off the year red hot. Oil prices rallied from less than $80 a barrel to more than $125 a barrel following Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. However crude has cooled off considerably since this summer steadily falling back into the low $80s on macroeconomic concerns. That more than 20% plunge in crude oil prices means oil is in a bear market.

However a new bull market for oil looks to be coming next year. Here's why crude seems set to rebound which could fuel big gains for oil stocks.

Wall Street is very bullish on oil

Most oil market analysts believe oil prices are going much higher next year. For example Jeff Currie the global head of commodities for venerable investment bank Goldman Sachs has a $110 forecast for Brent oil (the global benchmark price) in 2023. Rival investment bank Morgan Stanley agrees expecting Brent to top the $110 a-barrel mark by the middle of next year. While others aren't quite as bullish the consensus is that oil prices will rebound in 2023.

Analysts note several catalysts that should fuel crude's rebound in 2023. Morgan Stanley summed it up in a note to clients. The bank wrote ""We remain constructive on oil prices driven by recovering demand (China reopening aviation recovering) amid constrained supply due to low levels of investment risks to Russia supply the end of SPR releases and slowdown of U.S. shale.""

The biggest catalyst is China. ""The pent-up demand out of China is going to be enormous"" according to comments by Energy Aspects director of research Amrita Sen in The Wall Street Journal. Sen believes ""that could swing demand by at least a million barrels a day and that could easily make the difference between an oil price forecast of $95 to $105 versus $120 to $130.""

Meanwhile most oil companies plan to continue keeping a relatively firm lid on investment spending and output. For example while oil giant Chevron (CVX 0.22%) plans to boost its capital budget by 25% next year to $17 billion most of that increase is due to inflation and a ramp in lower-carbon investment spending. Likewise even though ExxonMobil (XOM -0.41%) plans to boost capital spending from $22 billion this year to $23 billion-$25 billion in 2023 it expects its production will remain flat at around 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. With demand poised to rise amid continued tight supplies oil prices seem primed to rally.

A boon for oil stocks

This outlook for higher oil prices bodes well for oil companies in 2023. It will enable them to continue producing strong earnings and cash flow. Meanwhile with most oil companies limiting investment spending they'll have more money to return to their shareholders via buybacks and dividends.

Oil giants Chevron and ExxonMobil are well positioned to capitalize on higher crude oil prices next year. However three other producers stand out as even more compelling buys right now. One of them is Marathon Oil (MRO -2.21%). It trades at a bottom-of-the-barrel valuation compared to its peers (the higher the free cash flow (FCF) yield the lower the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio):

Because of that Marathon Oil has been using its oil-fueled windfall this year to gobble up its dirt cheap stock. The oil company has already retired 20% of its outstanding shares. It also used its oil-fueled cash flows to buy Ensign Natural Resources for $3 billion. That deal will boost its free cash flow by 15% assuming recent oil prices and by an even greater percentage if oil prices soar. That deal could give Marathon more fuel to buy back stock next year.

Diamondback Energy (FANG -0.75%) is another dirt cheap oil stock. That's a big reason it offers investors a high dividend yield which is currently over 6.5%. The other reason is its variable dividend strategy. What's noteworthy is that Diamondback has shifted its capital allocation strategy over the past quarter paying out a lower variable dividend so it can buy back more of its shares. The company could continue to pay a big-time dividend and gobble up more of its stock next year. It's in an even better position to capitalize on higher oil prices after recently agreeing to spend $3.3 billion to buy two cash-gushing oil companies. Those deals position it to produce even more free cash next year.

Finally analysts see a nearly 60% upside potential in Devon Energy (DVN -1.44%). They point to its strong balance sheet extensive drilling inventory and variable dividend framework. Another upside catalyst is that Devon recently closed two deals that it expects will boost its cash flow by 25% in the fourth quarter. Those acquisitions put it in an even better position to capitalize on higher oil prices next year.

High-upside oil stocks

Oil appears primed to rally sharply in 2023. While higher prices would benefit all oil stocks Marathon Diamondback and Devon stand out as best positioned to capitalize on higher crude prices. All three recently made cash-gushing acquisitions which could give them even more money to buy back their cheap stocks and pay dividends. That makes them the top oil stocks to buy heading into 2023.",,,,,,,,,

That’s because banks stuck with billions of dollars of risky corporate loans a hangover from deals underwritten in a lower-rate environment are unlikely to back sizable new transactions until well into 2023 dealmakers say.

“It may be the second half of the year before banks return in force to leveraged buyouts” EQT AB Chief Executive Officer Christian Sinding said speaking generally rather than in relation to his firm.

Those lenders “haven’t been there to underwrite not in any meaningful size and still aren’t” he added later.

That leaves buyout giants such as EQT CVC Capital Partners and KKR & Co. with fewer funding options for acquisitions a far cry from previous years when they took advantage of cheap borrowing rates to make debt-fueled acquisitions — and disposals — of companies. The easy money era had been a boon for the industry helping increase assets under management by more than 250% in just over a decade.

Private equity firms typically buy companies with a combination of equity and debt. The debt portion is usually secured through a bridge loan from a syndicate of banks who then sell it to leveraged loan and bond investors.

Rising borrowing costs have disrupted that model leaving lenders stuck with about $40 billion of the loans that are now worth less than when they were advanced. Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter alone makes up $13 billion of that. The banks have also committed billions of dollars more for other acquisitions limiting their ability to finance new deals.

Already some buyout firms have made all-cash acquisitions a trend that mainly benefits those players that have raised big funds.

For example KKR agreed to an all-cash €2.3 billion ($2.44 billion) deal for French insurer April Group according to people with knowledge of the matter. Francisco Partners Thoma Bravo and Stonepeak Partners are among those that announced new acquisitions in recent weeks without debt financing in place. The danger for such purchases is that firms could end up with big single positions in their funds that could make returns volatile.

Cash deals

“The buy now borrow later trend will likely continue into the first half of next year” said Pete Mason co-head of capital markets at Barclays Plc for the Europe Middle East and Africa region. “Banks will underwrite at terms that will reflect where we are in the credit cycle.”

To be sure companies no longer carry the costly price tags that they did during 2020 and 2021 when unprecedented central bank stimulus flooded the market with cash and supercharged company valuations. Still the sharp spike in borrowing costs limit private equity’s ability to take advantage of the drop in valuations.

Without cheap credit the money managers lose one of the keys to their ability to do large acquisitions. Instead the competitive edge will return to companies with stronger balance sheets that had traditionally used that to secure less expensive loans.

“Financing will not be an issue for these companies in the current environment while valuations are currently very attractive for a potential buyer” said Matthias Reschke head of European investment grade finance at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “We expect this to drive transactions in the future.”

Amgen Inc. this week used balance sheet cash and a $28.5 billion bridge loan to fund its purchase of Horizon Therapeutics Plc with Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. as lead arrangers.

Reschke says JPMorgan is also open to funding substantial acquisitions. “Our bridge book has a lot of spare capacity and we will use it to enable strategic deals” he added.

Companies that have portability debt clauses — which allows sellers to dispose of a company without having to repay the debt at the deal close – will also become more attractive to buyers according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified as they were not authorized to comment publicly.

Alternative asset managers that want to add companies without those clauses to their portfolios will have to become more creative with financing turning to things like vendor loan notes a form of financing provided to buyers and typically secured on an asset like the company’s goods.

“Some private equity firms that are sellers are providing financing to the buyers” Sinding said. “All of our new deals this year have been with private credit.”

Private credit

Private credit’s a swelling market that includes Blackstone Inc. and Ares Management Corp. but that industry doesn’t have the same capacity to support major deals unless significant numbers of them become involved.

That’s viewed by buyers as less preferable than dealing with a small number of trusted bankers. Others will stick with all cash deals in the knowledge that borrowing conditions will eventually improve.

“They will have to pay more to get their deals away” if they come to the debt markets instead said Vincent Benguigui a senior credit portfolio manager who oversees $1.6 billion of assets for Federated Hermes in London. “All these private equity firms have phenomenal dry powder – now it’s time for them to use it.”

Forty-nine percent of inclusionary-unit respondents among the 430 residents surveyed said they had not experienced bias though and there was an overall sense of belonging among them despite any incidents with 93 percent of owners and 78 percent of renters saying they felt at home in their building or complex.

Still the survey findings worried city councillors who said the data bore out issues they’d been hearing for years.

“I was not surprised” said E. Denise Simmons the councillor chairing the Housing Committee hearing where the data was presented. “I have heard [inclusionary residents say they] felt like they were a child of a lesser god.” Other councillors and vice mayor Alanna Mallon also told of being contacted by individual residents over the years about problems.

Bias most commonly took the form of people acting “as if they were better than you” and showing less courtesy and respect “a few times a year up to almost every day” said Alexandra Curley a member of the National Initiative on Mixed-Income Communities study team from Case Western University in Cleveland. That’s despite inclusionary renters and especially owners being a highly educated group with 62 percent of owners surveyed having either a master’s degree or another advanced degree.

People in inclusionary units also often live in Cambridge longer than the market-rate tenants or owners who might look down on them. The average length of residence among inclusionary renters was 26 years and for owners 19 years.

Throughout the survey respondents talked about fear of retaliation and eviction and some talked about experiencing it “getting an eviction notice as soon as they report a problem” Curley said. With that fear as a backdrop “we didn’t hear from anybody who indicated that they had reported an incidence of bias that it was resolved in a appropriate way.”

The bright side

The problems also persisted despite a rule set by the city from the start of the inclusionary program in 1998: Its units are to be indistinguishable in quality and location from market-rate homes and there now being more than 1100 such homes occupied or being built citywide according to the Community Development Department. Under current provisions 20 percent of residential floor area in projects of 10 or more units must be set aside for low- and moderate- income tenants or moderate- and middle- income homebuyers.

If there was a bright side it’s that the study is being done at all said the Case Western Team. Despite there being inclusionary programs in several U.S. cities there is little effort to look into how bias and discrimination affects tenants.

“Most cities are having the conversation whether to have inclusionary housing” said Mark Joseph of the study team. “Cambridge is way out front in terms of your percentage and your requirement of the units. And you’re probably familiar with having to compare yourself to yourself.”

Because there were no other bias studies that could be found “the request from the City of Cambridge immediately stood out to us” Joseph said.

Property management problem

Cambridge officials and residents speaking during public comment confirmed for the Case Western team that the problems they identified were long-lasting including an inability to hold property management teams responsible for complaints whether because of frequent turnover that made training hard or because some managers just don’t care. Among renters 59 percent of bias was experienced from property managers and only 32 percent from fellow tenants the survey said.

Some examples from the Tuesday conversation: getting grief from property management over a request to hold a yard sale in a community room that’s more usually used for wine-and-cheese events or being required to pay rent online – and then being assessed a fee for doing so. Because the number of inclusionary households will by definition be a minority managers “are not going to put a lot of time or energy into really understanding they have different needs” said Michael Johnston executive director at the Cambridge Housing Authority.

It can also be hard to escape a bad situation. Program rules can discourage residents from taking jobs that will nudge them past an income threshold and force them out of their home Simmons said.

The discussion and work will go on Simmons said.

Wine tastings in the common room

Among public commenters was Valerie Bonds who noted that property-manager trainings that were being suggested “have been asked for for five decades [as] we have heard similar stories seen similar reports yet this type of behavior continues.” She pointed to the failure of tenant councils and tenant associations to intervene.

Inclusionary resident Kathy Watkins said she was also “a little cynical” that anything would change and urged the City Council to explore other forms of housing that gave tenants more say over how a building is run and maybe found ways to encourage better longer-term relationships.

“When I first moved into an inclusionary housing unit I tried to participate in some of the building activities and get to know people. But people move out so quickly that I just gave up” Watkins said. Activities put on by management companies can also be off-putting especially to lower-income tenants. “They’re just not something that interests me a lot of these wine tastings. Most of the events they put on are trying to sell you things.”

Here's What That Means for My 2023 Property Taxes,"There's a reason so many people have struggled to buy a home over the past year. Property values are way up on a national level. And while that's allowed some homeowners to capitalize by borrowing against their home equity and it's also made it possible for sellers to profit nicely it's made life really difficult for buyers.

Meanwhile in some parts of the country property values are assessed on a yearly basis. That means each year your home is assigned a new value based on what it could potentially sell for.

At first glance a higher assessed value might seem like a good thing since it means your home is worth a greater amount. But from a tax perspective a higher assessed value could spell trouble.

Such is the situation many homeowners are in this year. With property values being up on a national level a lot of people are apt to see their property taxes rise due to higher assessments. And in parts of the country where property taxes are super high to begin with like mine that's problematic.

My property tax bill could soar

Over the past year the assessed value of my home rose $100000. And many people in my town saw comparable increases.

This isn't because I live in a particularly desirable neighborhood. Rather I live in a pretty standard suburban area.

This massive uptick in property values is really in line with national trends. The only thing is that home prices in New Jersey where I live tend to be much higher than average to begin with -- hence the really large increases.

Now New Jersey happens to have the highest property taxes in the nation. So now that home values are up property taxes could follow suit.

I already spend a lot of money on property taxes -- in fact the amount I spend on them is comparable to what I spend on my actual mortgage payments. So I'm really not eager to see those taxes go up. But while that could happen it's not guaranteed.

Why my bill may not climb all that much

Property taxes are generally calculated by taking the assessed value of a home and multiplying it by whatever local tax rate applies. So at first it might seem inevitable that a higher home value will lead to a higher tax bill.

But towns can only get away with charging so much money in property taxes. Those taxes need to be collected to meet a certain budget. But if you have a situation where everyone's property assessments are way up it means that on an individual basis homeowners may not get hit with such hefty property tax increases. That's because everyone is sharing the burden of paying enough tax to collectively meet budgetary needs.

To put it another way my home may have a higher assessed value now -- just like most homes in my neighborhood. But our town might then lower our tax rate so that after all's said and done people's bills aren't rising by $2000 or $3000 in the coming year but rather more like $200 or $300.

As such I'm not at the point of panicking over my higher home assessment. While I recognize that it could result in a higher property tax bill that hike may not be so extreme. And if it is I'll do what I can to fight my next assessment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL25ldy15b3JrLzIwMjIvMTIvMTcvemFyYS1mb3VuZGVyLWFtYXpvbi1zcGVuZC1iaWctb24tc2VhdHRsZS1ob3VzaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amancio Ortega Amazon Spend Big in Seattle,"A couple of heavy hitters made significant though disparate investments in Seattle-area real estate last week.

Meanwhile Amazon last week announced it is investing another $150 million to develop or preserve about 1700 affordable housing units in the Puget Sound region Axios reported.

The latest announcement brings Amazon’s investment in affordable housing in the Seattle area to $500 million Amazon’s Housing Equity Fund director Catherine Buell told the outlet.

Amazon through its Amazon Housing Equity Fund has invested significantly in the area in light of claims that the company has contributed to rising housing costs and gentrification.

Low-rate loans and grants in the most recent round of funding will go to 10 housing projects in Seattle Renton Bothell Tacoma Federal Way and Kirkland Axios reported. The units will be available to individuals and families who earn between 30 and 80 percent of the area’s median income which was $105000 in 2021.

It’s estimated that in 2019 there was a shortage of more than 80000 units in the Seattle metro area and 140000 units statewide.

More than 160000 customers in New England were in the dark as of the afternoon and another 20000 were without power in New York as heavy snow brought tree limbs onto power lines according to poweroutage.us which tracks outages across the country.

Restoration efforts were complicated by snow still falling in some places making travel dangerous. Doug Foley Eversource president of electric operations in New Hampshire said snow-covered roads were making it tough for workers to reach communities in order to assess damage and make repairs.

""We are still taking on system damage in parts of the state where heavy wet snow continues to fall and hundreds of additional crews are coming to New Hampshire to support our restoration effort” Foley said in an emailed statement.

As of Saturday afternoon Eversource had restored power to nearly 61000 customers in New Hampshire since the beginning of the storm but another 40000 remained without power according to the utility.

Green Mountain Power which serves customers in Vermont said more outages were possible there with temperatures not expected to warm up enough in the next couple of days to melt the snow.

Maybe you came across a story about North American growers keeping greenhouses at cooler temperatures to save on heating costs. Or perhaps this year you attended a conference facilitated by top research organizations like GLASE and RII where thought leaders gathered to tackle energy challenges.

Energy will be a trending word this year for greenhouse growers. Energy costs for 2023 promise to be a crucial place for businesses to focus so controlled environment agriculture operations can maintain profitability. In certain regions of the U.S. like the Northeast utility rate increases will squeeze margins already slim from other financial pressures like inflation.

Energy rate increases are the ripple effects of oil supply constraints and pricing volatility. Much of the electricity generated in North America is sourced from natural gas power plants and crude oil prices rose quickly following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Utilities propose rate increases to regulators based on forecasted cost of generation to adjust the share paid by their customers and this year many utilities proposed large jumps.

New England is a hotbed of both electricity and natural gas rate increases. In Rhode Island in October the commercial electric rate increased between 41% to 51% and natural gas customers are simultaneously feeling the impact of a 9.6% rate increase. In Connecticut Eversource has proposed a 50% increase in electricity rates and New Hampshire growers may face a similar situation. In Massachusetts National Grid electricity customers saw a 64% increase in rates in November and Eversource’s electric rate increases of up to 43% will be taking effect in January 2023. The data visualization produced by WBUR demonstrates the size of the utilities’ rate hikes in comparison to historical rates; in some regions of Massachusetts growers may soon pay 34 cents a kilowatt-hour (kWh) up from averages of $0.15/kWh.

Many heated greenhouses use delivered fuels like propane if facilities are not connected to a natural gas grid. This year New Jersey growers experienced high fuel prices this year and passed down higher operating costs to their customers increasing market price for their products by 30% to 40%. Looking ahead the Energy Information Administration forecasts “retail prices this winter for heating oil to be 16% higher than last winter and propane prices to be relatively close to last winter’s average” but fuel costs vary regionally. Growers may have to choose between running heaters and paying higher bills or enduring longer harvest times caused by cooler greenhouse setpoints.

Resilience will also be a trending word for growers in 2023. The energy cost increases in the Northeast U.S. are an example of how utility rates across North America are contributing to increased operating expenses for growers. Greenhouses must employ efficient practices to contend with rising utility rates but in winter turning off supplemental lighting or keeping greenhouses cooler results in lower productivity. Rather than stunt plants or wait longer for harvest resilient facilities can use high-performance equipment and smart energy management practices to save on energy without impacting plant development.

Resilient facilities can prepare for rising energy costs by employing these strategies:

Exercise informed energy choice. Learn what options are available for energy utilities. In some regions like Massachusetts growers can choose a competitive electricity supplier to access lower rates. Benchmark energy metrics. Many growers track how much energy is used to grow their final product. Monitor energy performance over time to prove the impact of external changes like utility rate increases. Consider thermal energy storage. Some greenhouses store solar heat gain during the day in large tanks of water which can be used as buffers to avoid running heating equipment at night. Install high-performance technology. Reduce demand for energy from HVAC and lighting systems to improve profit margins. Equipment like IR film can save heating energy by 15 – 35% and thermal curtains can offer energy savings of up to 50% in cold climates. LED horticultural lighting systems can reduce electricity demand by 20 – 50% in greenhouses. Partner with experts. Energy engineers like our team at ERI can provide specialized recommendations for optimizing controls to balance energy efficiency and plant productivity. Work with professionals to make operational adjustments and get rebates for efficiency projects.

And the hour is near.

The $21.7 million all-new Kennett Library and Resource Center currently under-construction at the corner of Willow and State streets in Kennett Square is set to open to the public this spring by May 30.

“This new library in this New Year means new beginnings. New beginnings for folks looking for upward mobility” said Chris Manna executive director of the Kennett Library.

“New beginnings for folks looking to experience cultural awakening. New beginnings for young — and old — learners” Manna said on Thursday.

“New beginnings for anyone looking to experience being part of the bigger community as we work to connect all corners of the community together” he said.

The Kennett Library was founded in 1896. The existing library’s home at 216 State St. is just up the block for the new location. The Bayard Taylor Memorial Library opened in 1961 and recently hit the market for $1.65 million.

In 2019 the old Kennett Library at 216 State St. recorded 110545 visitors.

In July there was a “topping off” ceremony on Willow Street at the home of the new library facility. Dignitaries and supporters attended the memorable event from across Chester County.

During that ceremony a steel beam adorned with an evergreen tree on one end and an American flag was placed atop the Kennett Library and Resource Center.

The Kennett Library serves the people of Kennett Square East Marlborough Kennett New Garden Newlin Pennsbury Pocopson and West Marlborough municipalities that are collectively home to 450000 people. However many people from elsewhere in Chester County especially London Britain and Franklin residents in nearby Landenberg visit the Kennett Library often as patrons.

Today the library is part of the Chester County Library System. Any book checked out within the countywide system may be returned at another county library.

Manna whose favorite book of recent reading is The Infinite Game by Simon Sinek said his personal philosophy is: “as long as we don’t quit on a project or goal then there will always be opportunities to find a pathway to success. Success is a mindset and understanding that losing today’s battle gives an opportunity to grow such that tomorrow can be a greater success.”

The campaign to build a new library began in January 2016 when Tom Swett was elected president of the Board of Trustees.

One of Swett’s ancestors Robert Poole created the thirty-six iron brackets and columns cast to Thomas Ustick Walters’ design for the dome of the United States Capitol in Washington D.C. Swett’s mother was a dear and lifelong friend of Julia Child as previously reported.

“While we have surpassed $17 million dollars in funds raised for the building we can always use the community’s support to finish off the $21.7 million dollar project” Manna said.

“Contributions to our annual appeal help to sustain us such that we can continue to provide outstanding resources for the community” he added.

Jeff Yetter president of the Board of Trustees gave the Daily Local News a tour of the new 21.7 million Kennett Library on Tuesday along with Kennett Township residents and donors Peter Doehring and Monique Giroux.

The new library has been over 20 years in the planning Yetter said. The current Board picked up the challenge in 2016.

“It will be the first new library in Chester County since 2003” Yetter said.

“Unlike Delaware where the state and county provide the funding for new libraries in Pennsylvania and Chester County it is up to each library’s Board of Trustees to raise the needed funding” said Yetter of Kennett Township.

As of December 15 $17 million has been raised to fund the all-new library which has a budget of $21.7 to construct. Yetter said this includes $3.9 million from the State of Pennsylvania RACP grants $2.5 million from the eight municipalities the library officially serves and $10.6 million from foundations and the members of the public.

“Everyone has a different reason to support the library” Yetter said on Thursday. “For some it is their library experiences early in life for others it is their love of literacy. For many it is the library’s Adult Literacy program that helps immigrants learn English to better assimilate into our society.”

To contribute to the Kennett Library supporters urge everyone to donate to its capital campaign titled Imagine.

“We need to open debt free so we can use our funds to provide programs and services instead of paying off a mortgage” Yetter said. “And support the library with a donation to the annual appeal as well. The library raises 33% of its annual operating costs through fundraising and donations.”

The all-new 33425-square-foot Kennett Library and Resource Center will be home to a vast collection of books for children teens and adults a dynamite 110-seat auditorium numerous meeting rooms four tutoring rooms and offer the public access to a plethora of contemporary technologies.

Several foundations institutions and businesses have stepped up to the plate to support this new municipal flagship destination to become a reality to benefit literacy and empower contemporary community connections for the entire region.

Yetter lauded the donor support of Longwood Foundation the Cabot Kjellerup Foundation and Pia Family Foundation; Longwood Gardens; and Tri-M Group Chatham Financial Foundation Exelon Corporation and WSFS Community Foundation.

He joined the Kennett Library Board of Trustees in July 2015.

His favorite book is A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. He described it as “a humorous study on human nature and our natural world.”

Yetter became president of the Kennett Library Board of Trustees in January 2020 after serving as vice president the previous three years.

“Find the right people to help get the job done” said Yetter when asked about the greatest lesson he’s learned since becoming board president. “We have an amazing Board of Trustees and Capital Campaign Committee that have committed themselves to making the dream come true.”

The Kennett Library offers more than 1000 free programs classes and events for all ages during the year including story times in English and Spanish.

Patti LaBelle known as the Godmother of Soul delivered a triumphant performance in September at Longwood Gardens during a benefit concert for the Kennett Library.

“God Bless the Kennett Library” LaBelle said at the opening of her performance.

“One of my fondest childhood memories is of checking out my first library book at the age of six” said donor Brenda Williams-Mercomes the former Kennett Square Borough Council president. “Libraries have always been magical places that bring me joy.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Their advertisements show guests of varying ethnic backgrounds gathering happily in sunny houses seeming to feel at home — or even better on vacation.

But some people of color — particularly Black guests — say that despite the policies and partnerships that home-sharing platforms have put into place they still face discrimination when booking or staying in vacation rentals. They are frustrated by what they say is a lack of understanding and accountability.

In a report released on Tuesday Airbnb acknowledged the issues and provided the first public data on the steps it has taken to reduce racial disparities including removing some human factors from the booking process.

Laura Murphy a civil rights expert who has directed the Washington legislative office for the American Civil Liberties Union and is now a senior adviser to Airbnb wrote the introduction to the report. It reveals some of what has been learned from Project Lighthouse an effort that was publicly started in 2020 by Airbnb and Color of Change an online anti‌discrimination group to use internal company data to measure patterns of discrimination.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY2EuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iYW5rLWFtZXJpY2Etc2F5cy1yZWNlc3Npb24tbGlrZWx5LTEyMDAwMDQ0Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of America says a recession is likely in the 1st quarter of 2023 - and recommends investors buy stocks in these 3 ...,"A Bank of America storefront.

Bank of America expects a recession in the first quarter of 2023 according to a recent client note.

Economists for the bank say the Fed's recent 50-basis-point rate hike did little to change an imminent slowdown scenario.

BofA also highlighted three stock-market areas to watch if a recession does strike.

The Federal Reserve's latest interest rate increase did little to change Bank of America's recession outlook.

Analysts wrote in a Thursday note viewed by Insider that the central bank's 50-basis-point hike ""provides little relief"" to their 2023 economic outlook.

""Following the Fed's recent 50bps rate hike our BofA economists remain cautious on the US economy and continue to expect a mild recession starting in 1Q23 with negative US GDP for 2023"" the note said.

While BofA posits stocks have a material downside of 36% next year analysts highlighted three market areas still worth considering.

""Our BofA strategists prefer quality income and small caps to growth stocks going into 2023"" the note said. Analysts also added that this outlook remains ""cautious for our Internet coverage group"" which includes companies like Amazon Alphabet Meta EBay and Expedia.

BofA specifically highlighted Meta and Google-parent Alphabet as best poised to navigate a potential recession successfully. And despite deep cuts to advertising revenue remaining a threat to both companies in a recession BofA says they still ""have potential investment spending and bonus accrual flexibility that could enable the companies to grow earnings in a mild to moderate recession scenario with flat to down revenues.""

Both companies did not perform well during the 2008 Great Financial Crisis but present economic headwinds are driven by inflation as opposed to a fundamental break in markets that investors saw in the last major recession.

And despite Meta laying off a record number of employees in 2022 the company's commitment to the metaverse and artificial intelligence investments remain positive points for the company's future the note added.

Some dwellings are designed to offer owners all the space they need. Plus they come with every amenity you can find in a regular-sized home. Wilhite is a beautiful gooseneck tiny house that proves you can still live large in a smaller space. It has a loft a super spacious kitchen a spa-like bathroom and a downstairs bedroom!

This gooseneck tiny home was designed by Indigo River Tiny Homes a family-owned business that has been around since 2005. The Texas-based company built its first house on land in 2009 and several years later it created its first mobile dwelling. Since 2017 Indigo River Tiny Homes has continued to design mobile habitats that fit the character and style of every owner.Some homes are smaller so they’re great for couples or folks who want to use them as rentals. But the company also builds impressive houses on wheels that push the boundaries of tiny living. One such dwelling is Wilhite. It’s a gooseneck tiny that doesn’t feel overwhelmingly cramped. This house has space for a whole family and it doesn’t hold back when it comes to styling and comfort.Wilhite measures 39 ft (11.8 meters) in length and it’s 8.5 ft wide (2.5 meters wide). It might not sound like a lot but it definitely feels really spacious. That’s because the gooseneck is surrounded by extra-large windows. The living room is perhaps the area that stands out the most.It sits in the additional space above the gooseneck tongue. Usually a tiny home like this has a bedroom positioned there to offer people more headroom. However this time the living room takes that spot. It’s a lovely area with huge windows that let natural light come inside. It includes a TV an electric fireplace that keeps the room warm during cold winter nights and a custom-built fold-down desk. People can work play games relax or admire the stunning views.But that’s not all. There’s an adjacent crawl-in closet that is connected to the living room via a small opening. This area can be used as a kids’ bedroom or as a storage room. This home has an ingenious design that makes it feel really large. The living room is not the only light-filled spot in this tiny.The kitchen is positioned right in front of the entryway and it also comes with numerous windows. Despite featuring black custom cabinetry it feels bright and airy. The kitchen is equipped with all the necessary appliances including a large sink a drawer dishwasher an apartment-size refrigerator and a four-burner propane cooktop with an oven. It has generous stainless steel countertops as well which provide all the space people need to prepare delicious meals.Of course there’s ample storage provided by several drawers and cabinets. And if that’s not enough across the kitchen you’ll find stairs with built-in storage that lead to the aforementioned living room. From the kitchen you can access the main floor bedroom which is separated from the rest of the house via a sliding barn door. It’s a simple room but it does fit a bed that can comfortably accommodate two. There’s enough space around the bed as well and you’ll notice that the team mounted a TV above the door too.Above the bedroom is the loft which can serve as a guest room a small workspace or maybe another bedroom. It really depends on the owners’ needs and preferences.Lastly the bathroom in this unit is loaded with amenities. Inside you’ll see a big shower with a pebbled floor and glass doors. It also includes a gorgeous vanity with a lighted mirror some cabinets for storage a standard flush toilet and a custom laundry nook created for a washer/dryer combo.Unfortunately Indigo River Tiny Homes doesn’t mention the price for Wilhite . Since these are customizable mobile dwellings the cost can go up or down depending on the materials finishes appliances and options chosen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vYS16LWFuaW1hbHMuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvYmVzdC1zdWdhci1nbGlkZXItY2FnZXMtcmV2aWV3ZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Sugar Glider Cages: Reviewed,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='a-z-animals.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /reviews/best-sugar-glider-cages-reviewed/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D80816E00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vYS16LWFuaW1hbHMuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvYmVzdC1zdWdhci1nbGlkZXItY2FnZXMtcmV2aWV3ZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Ltd-owned Indian Racing League—a city-based motorsports league which recently concluded its first season—are looking to invest about ₹150 crore over the next three years to further develop infrastructure and on marketing the league across the country.

The racing company is backed by infrastructure mogul Akhilesh Reddy director of infrastructure firm Meil Advanced Technologies Pvt. Ltd (MEIL) who owns a majority stake in RPPL. Dabur chairman Mohit Burman also has a minority stake of about 5% in the league which he has invested in his personal capacity. Its other stakeholders are racers Aditya Patel and Armaan Ebrahim who are co-founders and directors of the league as well as Abhinandan Balasubramanian another co-founder.

The investors made an initial investment of ₹150 crore towards the street circuit infrastructure or developing race tracks on ground. About ₹60 crore was invested in safety equipment electronics etc. and the running cost of the season including operations event execution and marketing was a further ₹50 crore. For the next season it has earmarked another ₹50 crore for operational expenses.

The company expects a return on investment over the next four to five years. It hopes to get returns from its sponsorships as well as media rights. This year it had over half a dozen sponsors which included hospitals infrastructure firms beverage tyre and lubricant companies among others. These include Apollo Hospitals ExxonMobil Kingfisher and Redbull.

The league was conceptualised in 2018 and was earlier known as X1Racing League with an investment of $1 million from a group of angel investors family offices and early-stage venture firms. It follows a six team format named after various cities including Hyderabad Delhi Bangalore Chennai Kochi and Goa. The teams went head to head over a four week period and this was broadcast on Star Sports. The league was won by GodSpeed Kochi.

Aditya Patel its co-founder said motorsports isn’t the easiest of sports to organise in India especially at a large scale level. Patel said that in most countries races are organised on proper race tracks except The Formula E championship which is done on street circuits. The league was held in two locations in Chennai and Hyderabad.

“We don’t have numbers from our television viewership yet since the league concluded only recently. It has been difficult to take this sport to the masses. Even if we take the case of the Buddh International Circuit in Greater Noida it’s a state of the art facility which is in a location which isn’t favourable for people around Delhi to visit. So for us we needed to take it to the masses. Street racing was on our mind. At the end of the day this is what the country needs to build interest in motorsports"" said Patel.

The format of the league is that each team has four drivers with a mix of Indian and international drivers and runs across four weeks. This is a gender neutral platform and for the next year the company is expecting to make this a five or six week programme.

“Infrastructure is a huge challenge in a country like India for this sport. While one part of the story is the infrastructure itself another part of the story is importing cars that follow safety standards which invite a lot of duties"" he added.

The league also intends to go beyond physical racing and will further develop its eSports racing which is a digital-simulator-based racing competition held in Mumbai Chennai Pune Hyderabad Ahmedabad and Delhi.

As a top player in the oil and gas business Rone’s paths have been laced with more roses than thorns. Those that say money making is an art and that Rone is a maestro in the field may be right after all.

Rone famously called the King of Gas is a corporate guy of no mean repute; he rubs shoulders with other high net-worth businessmen around the world. Unknown to many he still recognises that only God is the unseen hand behind his success story; and he submits absolutely to His will.

It seems one of his oft-recited prayers in the Bible is Psalms 65 verse 11 which says: “You crown the year with Your goodness and Your paths drip with abundance.”

On several nights he had kept vigil in deep communion with his Creator asking Him to grant and fulfill his heart’s desire. Mercifully his prayer has been granted considering that he has enjoyed abundant blessings in the outgoing year.

The Managing Director of UTM Offshores in October received the award of the Order of the federal government OFR. This is in recognition of his worthy deed love and contribution to the economic development of Nigeria.

While he was still basking in the euphoria of the honour the high-flying businessman signed a multibillion-dollar partnership with KBR JGC Corporation and Technip Energies to design Nigeria’s first floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility. The deal was signed for the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) of UTM’s natural gas project.

This came nearly a year after UTM inked a memorandum of understanding with Afreximbank worth $2 billion in order to create an opportunity to support a future final investment decision on the FLNG project.

With the FEED contract UTM moved the FLNG project from the fundraising stage to the implementation phase and continued working with NNPC Limited and ExxonMobil to expedite the development exploitation and monetisation of stranded gas resources.

The project’s completion will ensure energy security access to energy and clean cooking gas in Nigeria the region and beyond as Europe seeks alternative gas suppliers as the bloc diversifies energy sources away from Russia due to the Ukraine conflict.

With the contract the development of the FLNG facility in block OML 204 offshore Nigeria kicked off enabling the exploitation of stranded gas resources sustainably while contributing to the Nigerian government’s agenda of reducing flaring and optimising environmental sustainability in energy developments.

His armour against failure is ceaseless prayers. Little wonder he never jokes with prayers in all he does."

What's He Saying?,"Noto recently made a big insider purchase of SoFi's common stock.

Recently SoFi Technologies' (SOFI -1.70%) CEO Anthony Noto purchased $5 million of the company's common shares. When the CEO of a company makes a big purchase like this it's a good signal to the market that he or she thinks the stock is undervalued and likes the company's long-term prospects.

Like most consumer-facing fintech stocks SoFi had a difficult 2022 and the stock is down more than 70% after a monstrous year in 2021.

In this particular case however I think Noto is really trying to speak to the market to assure it that numerous concerns that have recently come to light are overblown. Let's evaluate the concerns around SoFi and also take a look at what Noto is trying to tell the market here.

Examining recent concerns about SoFi

Aside from some of the highest inflation seen in more than 40 years and rapidly rising interest rates SoFi has had to deal with a litany of other issues.

The student loan moratorium was extended yet again and has now been in place for almost three years. Student loan refinancing was formerly SoFi's strongest business. I do view this as a short-term headwind but it's been amazing to see the moratorium last this long.

In November lawmakers sent a letter to SoFi and various banking regulators questioning SoFi's crypto activities and whether they are in compliance with an agreement the bank made with the Federal Reserve when the company acquired a bank earlier this year.

Other issues emerged in recent months and these are likely the main culprits behind the struggles of the stock. With student loan refinancing struggling SoFi quickly ramped up personal lending and now has $6.8 billion of personal loans on its balance sheet. However it elected not to hold these loans to maturity and classified them as held for sale. If it had elected to hold them to maturity the company would have had to follow standard bank accounting practices and reserve for loan losses upfront.

But the decision to classify these as held for sale means SoFi needs to find institutional investors or banks to buy these loans at some point. But demand for personal loans is drying up across the industry this year. As the Fed rapidly raised interest rates investors now have a much higher cost of capital to fund loans they purchase which means they are going to demand higher returns as well. Furthermore the market is incredibly worried about the financial health of the consumer right now and is worried that a more significant recession could really cause a lot of pain. Higher risk also leads investors to request higher returns.

The good news for SoFi is that it serves a high-quality borrower with a weighted average FICO score of 746 and a weighted average annual income of $160000. Still no personal loan portfolio is immune to loan losses and I suspect if SoFi did hold the loans to maturity reserve levels would be at least 5% of the portfolio which would equate to hundreds of millions of dollars in reserves.

Regulatory capital

Regulatory capital is getting depleted quickly. A common capital ratio that bank investors and regulators watch is the common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio which is a bank's core capital divided by its risk-weighted assets such as loans. In the third quarter SoFi's CET1 ratio fell from more than 30% to 24%. Now I do want to make it clear that SoFi is still extremely well-capitalized and has over three times the amount of capital it is required to hold.

But investors might be worried that if demand for SoFi's loans dries up the company will have to eat losses on these loans which will deplete capital quickly. Additionally SoFi is going to continue to see its CET1 ratio decline if it keeps growing the balance sheet (growing the denominator of the CET1 ratio). Of course banks can replenish capital with earnings but SoFi doesn't have any because it is still losing money which also cuts into capital.

SoFi grew loans from about $6 billion at the start of this year to more than $11 billion at the end of the third quarter. It had about $3.2 billion of risk-based capital and $13.2 billion of risk-weighted assets (24% CET1). If we assume SoFi added another $5 billion of personal loans to the balance sheet in 2023 and the company has the same amount of capital as it does now then its CET1 ratio would fall from 24% to about 17.5% ($3.2 billion/$18.2 billion).

Again SoFi is still well capitalized at this level but then it's still losing money and any potential loan losses would significantly hurt capital as well. Also if capital keeps declining like this then there is the question of how the company maintains fast levels of growth that investors rely on without raising capital.

What is Noto trying to say with his purchase?

First I think Noto is signaling that crypto concerns are overblown. Two Noto is probably not concerned about the company's ability to sell personal loans on the balance sheet considering the high-quality book.

Sitting here today I don't necessarily disagree with Noto. The Fed did a minor pivot on interest rates this month and should be done hiking rates by early next year. That will ease funding costs and during this time SoFi should be able to raise interest rates it charges on new loans making returns more attractive and hopefully getting investors back in the game.

However I really can't say any of this with certainty and we still don't know if there will be a recession next year or how severe such a recession might be. I mean I don't think I could have predicted much of what happened this year.

There is certainly the possibility of a severe recession and I do know most investors are incredibly concerned about the financial well-being of the consumer. Investing is all about assessing risk and the concerns raised above are legitimate and could be very bad for SoFi if things go south next year. Until these concerns dissipate I wouldn't expect positive sentiment for the stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A landscaper who was working for Plant Healthcare tried to free the driver who was trapped under the truck. Witnesses said the driver crashed while avoiding striking another car near Riviera Drive and Aurelia Street.

“They were trying to help the driver at first but it became apparent very very quickly that there was nothing that could be done and they covered the body” said Noreen Sablotsky who witnessed the crash.

Sablotsky told Local 10 News that she saw the driver just minutes before the fatal crash.

“I saw the driver personally like two minutes before the accident happened and she was fine” she said.

Officers with the Coral Gables and Miami-Dade police departments responded to the site of the crash at 5500 Rivera Drive just west of the University of Miami. Sgt. Alejandro Escobar said MDPD detectives were investigating the crash.

“We don’t believe it’s foul play at this time but our investigators are investigating and looking into every possible detail” said Escobar.

“We extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the individual involved” said Dave Hill a spokesman for FedEx Ground.

Police have not yet released the identity of the driver.

A widow is suing FedEx arguing that faulty tires on one of the company’s trucks caused the fiery crash that killed her husband.

Hamilton Platt 32 died on 21 September after he crashed into a FedEx truck that blew a tire and stopped in the middle of an Alabama highway.

His wife Kelsie Platt 28 first learned about the crash on social media.

Reading the comments she said “One of them was like ‘Yeah someone’s definitely dead in that car. The smell was horrible driving by.’ It was hard to see that but I still held out hope that he wasn’t in there”.

She told WPMI “I just started texting him. I love you just on the off chance he may see it”.

Her wrongful death lawsuit against the company states Mr Platt survived the initial crash and that he was “aware of his impending death and that he was burning alive”.

Ms Platt told WPMI that their children aged eight and five are having a hard time dealing with their father’s passing.

“My son isn’t doing that great” she said. “He doesn’t understand heaven and that daddy is in heaven. There for a little while he was angry with the idea of Jesus and God that they were keeping him up there.”

The lawsuit argues that FedEx Goodyear and the other parties named in the suit used faulty retread tires.

Attorney Ed Rowan who represents Ms Platt told WPMI: “It’s a hazard. It’s playing Russian roulette driving on the roadway with tires in this condition”.

He argued that the tires on the truck were bald separating and should have been switched out before the crash took place.

“You would also hope that FedEx is inspecting their vehicles and their tires. I mean inspecting the tires is one of the most important things you can do” Mr Rowan said.

In 2016 FedEx settled a lawsuit filed in Wyoming following a deadly collision.

“All of this could have been prevented” Ms Platt told WPMI.

In a statement FedEx told NBC News 15 that “we continue to extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Mr Platt. We have been fully cooperating with investigating authorities. We will defend the lawsuit”.

The Independent has reached out to FedEx Goodyear and Ms Platt.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL2NvbW1hbmRlcnN3aXJlLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzE4L3dhc2hpbmd0b24tY29tbWFuZGVycy1hbHRlci1sZWdlbmRhcnktc2FmZXR5LXNlYW4tdGF5bG9yLW1lbW9yaWFsLWFoZWFkLW9mLW5mbC1zdW5kYXktbmlnaHQtZm9vdGJhbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Washington Commanders: Team alters Sean Taylor memorial at FedEx Field,"Three weeks ago before the Washington Commanders hosted the Atlanta Falcons the franchise honored legendary safety Sean Taylor with a memorial at FedEx Field.

It didn’t go over too well with some.

There were plenty of reactions many not good claiming the Taylor memorial looked like a mannequin and was certainly not a statue. In fairness to Washington the organization never promised a statue. That was assumed in the media.

Taylor’s family including his daughter Jackie were involved throughout the process and happy with the results.

However that didn’t stop the Commanders from making some adjustments to the Taylor memorial ahead of the Week 15 edition of Sunday Night Football.

Peter Hailey of NBC Sports Washington shared an updated picture of the Taylor memorial on Twitter Sunday noting some of the changes.

Just got this pic of the Sean Taylor installation which has been changed. The facemask is finally taped. The jersey which was Nike is now Reebok. The socks are different and the ankles are taped too. Wish the team got this right the first time. But good fixes regardless pic.twitter.com/2HxtVP0Aa4 — Pete Hailey (@PeteHaileyNBCS) December 18 2022

Washington applying tape to the face mask and changing the socks are a more accurate reflection of Taylor. The jersey move was correct too as Taylor only wore the Reebok jersey during his four NFL seasons.

Kelsie Platt 28 of Baldwin County Alabama said she and her kids eight and five are haunted by the loss of Hamilton 32 after his car slammed into a FedEx truck that blew a tire on the interstate on September 21.

The crash caused Hamilton's vehicle to burst into flames burning him alive with the wreckage uploaded on social media for Platt to find as she grew worried when he was late coming home WPMI reports.

'One of [the comment] was like 'Yeah someone's definitely dead in that car. The smell was horrible driving by.' It was hard to see that but I still held out hope that he wasn't in there' Platt said.

She has now filed a wrongful death suit against FedEx and Goodyear the tire manufacturing company claiming its tires were faulty as her lawyer said the delivery company was effectively playing 'Russian roulette' on the roadways.

It is the latest lawsuit against FedEx after the father of slain minor Athena Strand filed a million dollar suit against the company for contracting his daughter's murderer.

The widow said her family is haunted by the crash and wants to hold FedEx and tire manufacturer Goodyear responsible

According to Platt's lawsuit Hamilton had survived the initial impact when his car hit the FedEx truck meaning he was 'aware of his impending death and that he was burning alive.'

Attorney Ed Rowan claimed the incident was a direct result of faulty retread tires tires which have been reprocessed to remove wear and tear.

Rowan told WPBN that the tires on the FedEx truck were bald separating and should have clearly been replaced with new ones.

'It's a hazard' he said. 'It's playing Russian roulette driving on the roadway with tires in this condition.

'You would also hope that FedEx is inspecting their vehicles and their tires. I mean inspecting the tires is one of the most important things you can do.'

Platt said she wanted the company to be held accountable adding that her children are still shaken about not having their father around anymore.

'My son isn't doing that great' Platt told the local outlet. 'He doesn't understand heaven and that daddy is in heaven.

'There for a little while he was angry with the idea of Jesus and God that they were keeping him up there.'

FedEx said in a statement: 'We continue to extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Mr. Platt. We have been fully cooperating with investigating authorities. We will defend the lawsuit.'

This is not the first time the delivery company has been accused of using faulty tires on its trucks.

In 2016 the company faced a federal lawsuit over a triple fatal collision in Wyoming which was settled for $240 million.

FedEx is currently dealing with another lawsuit regarding the death of Athena Strand seven who was kidnapped and strangled to death by driver Tanner Horner.

Athena's father Jacob also names the contractor hired by FedEx that employed Horner Big Topspin.

One section of the lawsuit alleges that FedEx put 'dangerous persons in a position of trust' even though Horner wasn't employed directly by the packaging giant.

Another section accuses FedEx of having 'significant control' of people who come to their customer's homes.

Jacob Strand argues that neither FedEx nor Big Topspin ran a proper background check on the suspect. He has no known criminal history.

Big Topspin serves the area where Strand was last seen the van driven by the suspect is owned by FedEx and the suspect was authorized to wear the company's uniform the lawsuit says.

A statement on Strand's employment from FedEx read: 'The employees of these service provider companies are subject to criminal history background checks as part of the driver eligibility process.'

The press release continued: 'As is common across the industry and considered standard employment practice the background check process is administered by a third party.'"

Next year a consortium led by American Infrastructure Holdings LLC that includes Solar Dynamics and Andritz Separation will build a pilot facility in Albuquerque New Mexico to demonstrate a novel dryer technology to produce granular fertilizer from biosolids that will be powered by solar heat.

Fossil fuels are used in the current methods of manufacturing nitrogen and phosphate for fertilizer: they are used to mine and grind up phosphate rock or to burn at high temperatures to chemically react nitrogen from air as part of the process of manufacturing ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

Replacing fossil-fueled heat in industrial processes is one of the world’s next big tasks. A third of the emissions that are destabilizing our climate come from fossil-fueled industrial heat.

Environmental benefits

Solar Dynamics will supply the solar system to provide heat for the dryer. The firm has already been funded to design and computationally simulate the solar process and is now poised to build a solar field that integrates its solar thermal energy system with a dryer system supplied by biosolids from the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority water reclamation treatment plant to produce nitrogen granules for commercial sale as fertilizer.

“Right now roughly 70% of the biosolids at this plant are applied to the land” explained Ryan Shininger Solar Dynamics senior engineer. “This pilot project uses half of what’s currently being land-applied. If it’s successful we’ll double our plant to process the remaining biosolids so they’re not land applying any biosolids at all.”

Currently only 30% of biosolids gets recycled – mixed with wood chips and other organic materials to sell as compost to local farms parks ballfields and other landscape areas or soil enhancement to remediate disturbed land. It is obviously nonsensical that the US imports more than half of the nitrogen used in fertilizers while throwing away biosolids that are rich in nitrogen phosphorus and micro-nutrients.

There is a value to up-cycling biosolids as granular fertilizer instead of land-disposing them. Biosolids which are 80% water are hauled sometimes hundreds of miles away and dumped in landfills or plowed into the land. This disposal process is compliant with federal and most state environmental statutes but it is not environmentally optimal.

The problem with dumping biosolids on land

While this is not the case in Albuquerque in some locations land application can result in nutrient runoff to local waterways and percolation into groundwater. More importantly land disposal of biosolids generates greenhouse gasses: methane CO2 and NOx.

“In many places” he pointed out “even if raw biosolids are land-applied to grow crops it remains a disposal strategy which if improperly managed can result in adding too much nitrogen and phosphorus all at once. Plants use some but the rest is wasted. When nutrients end up in waterways they can cause “dead zones” with no oxygen where nothing can live.”

There are geopolitical advantages as well. Given recent shocks in the global market for these fertilizer minerals that are crucial for food production recycling them from municipal biosolids domestically reduces reliance on imports from potentially unstable sources overseas.

“This is a problem that predates the Ukraine war however” Shininger noted. “The US government already has initiatives to try to increase the amount of domestic fertilizer production. Right now more than 50 percent of the fertilizer used in the US is imported and most of it is imported from China or Russia. But obviously the war has put additional stress on the system.”

A “bolt-on” solar thermal system

Solar Dynamics’ solar field of parabolic trough collectors and thermal energy storage would connect to a commercial dryer which has been adapted to heat the air in the dryer with hot water from the solar field.

This heat which would normally come from natural gas would instead be generated by reflected sunlight from a solar field of Solar Dynamics’ SunBeamTM parabolic trough collectors that will heat the water to 200°C. The performance of the solar collectors will be proven by the pilot facility.

The project will represent the first commercial installation of the Solar Dynamics SunBeam collector. Solar Dynamics has received funding from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Solar Energy Technology Office to help support the demonstration of the solar technology that was developed in part with funding from DOE.

Thermal energy storage will extend the dryer operations beyond just daytime hours allowing greater utilization of the dryer and improved overall economics. This stored solar energy also will smooth out intermittently cloudy conditions and stabilize the relatively easily achieved temperature.

The commercially available tank used in the LPG industry is about 40 meters long by about 3 m in diameter and operates as a thermocline using internal baffles to bring hot water to the plant to heat the dryer. Cold water is sent back to the solar field to be reheated. The thermocline doesn’t have to perform perfectly for the system to work. Some amount of mixing is not a problem in this case because of the flexibility of the biosolids dryer. It’s very different than a power plant.

Although the facility is a scaled-down pilot it is structured to operate commercially for at least 20 years. The project will require equity investment to fund the construction of the dryer and fertilizer blending system. Private investment will be repaid with a combination of biosolids tipping fees and fertilizer sales.

“Solar Dynamics doesn’t have much involvement on that side” Shininger said. “Our partner American Infrastructure Holdings is responsible for raising the equity and contracting the fertilizer sales. Fertilizer sales are a little more challenging because the fertilizer market is based largely on spot pricing. So it’s not the same as getting a 25-year contract for electricity for CSP where you know exactly what you’ll get paid over that time.”

First-mover advantage for a solar thermal technology

Only about 2% of all biosolids generated in the US are used as some sort of fertilizer. The market is just beginning and this Albuquerque project is the first in the country to integrate solar thermal energy with biosolids drying to manufacture a commercial fertilizer. “We see numerous opportunities across the country and worldwide to apply this process” said Shininger “So we look forward to proving it out in our pilot and rapid adoption across the US.”

When proven this solar process could become the default technology for zero-emissions fertilizer manufacturing. Biosolids-based fertilizers will help stabilize recently inflated prices for nitrogen and keep them stable going forward. Plus increasing domestic fertilizer supplies supports a healthy balance of trade and helps ensure food security.

“Frankly it’s hard to see why we haven’t done this already given the clear economic environmental and social benefits of solar-powered biosolids-based fertilizer production” said Shininger “and a lot of potential carbon reduction is riding on the success of this pilot.”

It consists largely of redbrick Victorian terraces. There are similar streets throughout the area in Walthamstow northeast London. Some houses are pebble-dashed. Some have doors painted in contemporary grey. There are wind chimes geraniums in boxes wheelie bins and the occasional cat sitting on a gate post. The only unusual feature is the number of windows displaying an A4 poster with the words “Power Station” printed in the font used by polling stations.

Power in the sense of the energy is at the forefront of everyone’s mind. Energy bills have reached record highs and are still rising with the war in Ukraine highlighting how fragile energy supplies can be. This year’s Cop27 climate conference promised money to poorer countries to assist with damage caused by climate change yet no agreement was reached on phasing out fossil fuels. The idea of cleaner power generated closer to home should feel like an obvious goal. But at the moment there are no large-scale programmes dedicated to making it happen. Instead there are people like Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell.

Well if someone came and said there was a way of helping with the bills you’d be over the moon wouldn’t you? Ejaz Hussain

These two are on the roof of their house sitting on a bed they have just assembled. It is made up with a knitted blanket bright sheets and a cheap foam mattress that is plastic-wrapped against the elements. Facing one way you can see their narrow back garden that ends when it hits the railway embankment. Turn around and you look down into their street Lynmouth Road which Dan and Hilary want to turn into a solar power station. They are living on their roof as a crowdfunder for the project. “I think it will be fine” says Hilary who has been scanning both the sky and the weather forecast. “I only get scared when the children say they want to come up then I turn to jelly.”

The couple are artists and filmmakers. They live in the middle of the street with their children Esmé 12 and George 10 and the family’s two dogs. “It is a street that has a sense of community” says Hilary down from the roof and sitting at their kitchen table. “That became apparent with the Covid mutual aid group that was set up.” And it was during lockdown that a sentence from economist Ann Pettifor’s book The Case for the Green New Deal which makes a strong argument for total decarbonisation and a financial system based on fairness struck both of them. The phrase was: “Every building a power station.” “We clung on to that” says Hilary.

There was also People’s Power by American writer Ashley Dawson. “He wrote about energy democracy and tackling the power monopolies within the energy industry” she adds.

The idea started to take shape. Could they make a home into a power station? And not just their home but perhaps their whole street by linking the houses together into a grid? Buying and installing a solar system for an average three-bedroom house costs around £10000 they discovered. Linking them together would be hard – the technology is complex especially in an urban area with lots of individual buildings. They did more research. And then they started talking to neighbours.

“Well if someone came and said there was a way of helping with the bills you’d be over the moon wouldn’t you?” says Ejaz Hussain 71 now retired. “If it comes off I’ll know that I’ve been blessed.”

Sipke Visser 45 is a photographer and retoucher. He lives with his wife their two children and his father-in-law. “I know Dan and Hilary so I wasn’t that surprised” he says “But I do think if a complete stranger were to knock on my door I would be very sceptical.”

“We looked at putting solar panels up quite a few years ago and we found the cost of doing it was too much” says Pippa Evans 57 who works at an adoption and fostering therapeutic agency. “So I was intrigued when this flyer came through the letterbox. I wanted to know how it was going to work and if we could afford it. Were Dan and Hilary going to coordinate everything? I knew about their previous project. So I knew they were quite good at making things happen.”

The previous project was Bank Job. In 2018 the couple started working in an empty building a former bank on one of Walthamstow’s main streets. They printed artwork that looked like bank notes complete with pictures of people from local community projects and sold them raising £40000 in the process. Half the money went back to the local groups. And with the remaining £20000 they bought up £1.2m worth of high-interest debt owed by people in the local community. “You can buy it for so much less because the assumption is that it won’t be paid off” says Dan. They let the debtors know there was nothing left to pay although GDPR rules meant this could only be done by sending letters via a debt broker. Then they packed up the paper records into a gold-coloured van and blew the whole thing up on wasteland outside Canary Wharf the towers of the UK’s financial sector looming in the background. The documentary they made about the project came out in 2021 and the remains of the van are currently on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

They describe Power Station as a natural evolution. “It’s also a show-and-do project” says Dan. “We’re learning as we go and we’re sharing it as we learn it.”

“We’re not setting ourselves up as experts” adds Hilary. “There isn’t just one solution and we don’t know everything about kilowatts per hour so we’re a conduit. We’re learning and educating ourselves and others and then also building partnerships with people who are experts.” Their own expertise they say is in making a project come to life and then drawing attention to the issues using art and storytelling.

As of 2019 there were around 300 community energy projects in the UK covering 67000 homes according to the thinktank Green Alliance. The sector was hit when the government’s community energy strategy was scrapped with at least 66 projects folding in 2017 and more becoming precarious. The initial grand design for Lynmouth Road was for an entire street interlinked powered for free and managed by a cooperative. But the mixture of rented and private leasehold and freehold and various mortgages with various banks meant dropping uniform infrastructure across the rooftops would be almost impossible. “It turns out that not many people fully own their roof” says Dan.

While the whole street can’t be linked now Dan harbours a dream of making this happen as the project grows and would love to see a community battery so that those who can’t have solar panels could also access power. And with 30 households involved – nearly half the residencies in Lynmouth Road – there is enough for the street to become a solar energy hotspot and model for what other streets could also achieve in terms of renewable power.

The project as it stands will be funded in various ways. There are grants from organisations such as the London Community Energy Fund. There’s the crowdfunder running while Dan and Hilary sleep on top of their house. They have also printed a new run of bank notes to sell the notes and large handprinting machines currently occupying half of their living room. Buying solar equipment in bulk brings the price down so participating residents can offer to pay but the scheme is free for those who need it to be. Each resident will be given a grant for their solar installation and deal with the company directly.

As we sit on the bed on the roof the surveyor from the solar company is finishing his assessments. He climbs the scaffolding at the back of the house to come and chat although he doesn’t make it all the way up. “It’s a bit ironic in my line of work but I’m not great with heights” he says.

Not everyone in the street has wanted or been able to take part. “Some people just shut the door before we started speaking” says Dan. “Then there were people who were dying or divorcing or moving. Or having a loft conversion.” Loft conversions came up a lot. They can make rooftops unsuitable for solar panels but the more frequent issue was that of imminent building work.

Andy Richford 70 is one of the people planning a loft conversion. An editorial consultant working in scientific publishing and with a background in ecology he believes the project will amplify a necessary message. “I’ve been banging on about it for years” he says. “I might not be able to participate in terms of getting the panels but making a difference is important to me. Putting solar panels on top of houses with a direct feed into the house means energy isn’t lost in transmission and we don’t have the worry of covering acres and acres of farmland or wild land.”

The ground on which Lynmouth Road stands was once part of the marshland on the banks of the River Lea. The remaining marsh is less than half a mile away some of it a Site of Special Scientific Interest and all of it popular with picnickers dog walkers runners and the occasional raver. The Lynmouth Road area says Hilary who has been looking into its history was a watercress farm until the houses started going up in 1886. The Victorian era was Walthamstow’s first growth spurt. Boosted by new rail links the land filled up with houses for workers. It remained a largely working-class area for most of the 20th century but in the 2000s house prices accelerated andWalthamstow with its garden terraces good schools and decent transport links became a prime location. Between 2012 and 2019 house prices more than doubled.

“It used to be full of very long-term residents” says Hilary. “One family staying in a house for decades. We moved in around 14 years ago and found a newspaper from 1945.” Dan also mentions a former resident Dorothy Burroughs who spent her 100 years living on the street only leaving to briefly enter a care home before her death last year. Dorothy remembered when electricity first came to the houses in the 1930s. “She said that people needed to be shown what to do and how to use appliances. People would come round and demonstrate.”

Ejaz Hussain has lived here since 1978. He has worked all of his adult life including 20 years at a local food processing factory now demolished to make way for flats. “I’m struggling although the mortgage is paid. I’ve got two daughters one at college one about to go to university. We put them first. But the bills come in and the house needs repairs and I’m on my pension” he says. Like many of his neighbours he had also looked at solar panels but had been unable to afford them. He has also watched the street change around him. “In the early days it was brilliant simple. You said good morning to your neighbours they said good morning to you. Then it got that if you said hello people would give you a funny look.” The Power Station project he says has meant the people in the street talk to one another once more. “This is what we want the community spirit” he says. “It costs nothing to look after one another.”

The collective nature of the scheme has been a draw for many of the residents. “We all have concerns about the environment” says Chris Humphreys 49 who works in education and lives with his wife Catherine and their two sons. “And you try and do your little thing but to be part of something bigger is very appealing. You see what’s happening in the news at the moment and you know it won’t be those people who make changes for the better. It’s got to start at the grassroots. I’ve never been especially active politically but I’m very happy to stand alongside our neighbours in what I think is hopefully a practical and positive solution.”

“I want to be part of the solution even if it’s just a small part” says Dee Tweedie 48 who has been involved with the project from the beginning and went door-to-door with Dan and Hilary to explain the idea. “We all want to save the planet and the prices of everything are rising in tandem… energy food mortgage. But you don’t always know what you can do when it’s just you and your family. It’s been lovely to meet so many of our neighbours. There’s camaraderie. Maybe that’s how it felt during the war.”

It’s building on the sense of community that started to grow during the pandemic Pippa Evans

“It’s building on the sense of community that started to grow during the pandemic” says Pippa Evans. “To me it’s almost as important as the energy. It’s within human nature to be self-centred at times and I think the political climate has encouraged that. But humans are sociable and we’re interdependent and those aspects can be emphasised when we’re working together and helping create something. As a community we can make bigger changes than as individual people.”

“The energy for what we do is drawn from anger but I don’t think you would necessarily see that as a tone in our films or in our work” says Dan. “But you wouldn’t see us here doing all this if we didn’t feel an intense sense of how absurd our political and social realities are. We’d like to see a kinder world but we’ve created a system that profits a very narrow minority and so many more people could be living more meaningful and useful lives.”

“I can be really angry” says Hilary. “We live in a society where Matt Hancock can be on celebrity TV and you think ‘What the fuck is going on? This is sick it’s like The Hunger Games. And we acquiesce. And the corruption and vandalism of those in charge are just forgotten. At the same time we can’t be paralysed” she continues. “I hope this can wake others up and make them realise you can take action and that the worst thing would be to sit in despair and do nothing.”

The Power Station may not be actively producing energy just yet but it has generated an idea that is already flowing to the rest of the area. Dan and Hilary are working with five local primary schools including the one their son attends to arrange funding and installation via the Solar for Schools project. People in neighbouring streets have started asking how they could join in.

“We’re busy behind the scenes working out how it could become a street-by-street model” says Hilary. “I hope after the first wave when there are people sharing testimonials others will want to be involved too.” On their wall they have an aerial photograph of the road with the houses already involved marked by coloured Post-It notes.

“I was kind of heartbroken when the obstacles to doing the whole street started to pile up” says Dan. “But I started to realise it doesn’t really matter. We have 30 households and more and more people expressing interest. Three nearby streets are starting to organise themselves. And we can share what we’ve learned. You need someone to coordinate otherwise scheduling the surveys is tough. You need at least 20 people. But you can go from there.”

The surveys on Lynmouth Road are just wrapping up. If all goes to plan the panels will start to go up in January. “I feel like we’ve promised people something and I want everyone to see it’s really happening” says Hilary. But even without the solar panels the street has started to change. “When society is organised from the top down you feel reliant on the government to change things” says Pippa Evans. “But if you have brave individuals who stand up and gather other people around them… We can stand up for ourselves we can do things ourselves.”

“We can be powerful us the people who should be powerless” says Dan. He is on his rooftop with the street – and the geraniums and cats and wheelie bins – spread out two storeys below. “We do have the power to change things.”

Two projects representing a total of 300 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy capacity will come up in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka in what’s seen as one of the largest wind-solar hybrid corporate power purchase agreements by a technology company in India. Once operational these projects are expected to generate 1163000 megawatt hours (MWh) of clean energy which is the equivalent amount of electricity needed to power 380000 average-sized households in New Delhi each year. Combined with three solar farms in Rajasthan Amazon now has five utility-scale renewable energy projects in India representing more than 720MW of renewable energy capacity.

The largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally

“As the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally we continue to build momentum for our renewable energy investments in India. The two new projects represent Amazon's first wind-solar hybrid projects globally” said Abhinav Singh Director – Customer Fulfilment Supply Chain and Global Specialty Fulfilment Amazon India. “We are on a path to powering our operations globally with 100% renewable energy by 2025 and have worked with government and industry stakeholders in India to unlock more corporate renewable energy procurement in the country. This year we have reached over 720MW of renewable energy capacity through utility-scale projects in India.”

Maximising clean energy use on the grid

According to McKinsey & Company renewable hybrid energy systems can play a key role in helping India accelerate the decarbonisation of power generation and lower the cost of electricity in the medium term. These maximise clean energy use on the grid by combining two technologies with different generation profiles. The new Amazon projects support India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy's (MNRE) wind-solar hybrid policy which aims to enable more such hybrid projects to efficiently utilise transmission infrastructure and land and reduce variability in renewable generation which improves grid stability.

Encouraging India Inc’s adoption of renewable energy

“This collaboration between Vibrant and Amazon will encourage the adoption of renewable energy by corporates in India. We expect India to be one of the earliest markets in the world to deliver renewable energy through similar hybrid projects. We are honored to collaborate with Amazon on its path to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025” said Srinivasan Viswanathan CEO Vibrant Energy a subsidiary of portfolio company of Macquarie's Green Investment Group.

100% renewable energy globally by 2025

Amazon is committed to reaching net-zero carbon across its business by 2040 and is on a path to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. Amazon is the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy with over 380 projects across 22 countries around the world. Once operational these projects will have the capacity to generate over 50000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of clean energy annually and supply renewable energy for a variety of Amazon facilities including corporate offices fulfillment centers data centers and physical stores which collectively serve millions of customers globally. As on 2021-end Amazon reached 85% renewable energy across its business. In Asia Amazon has now invested in 17 utility-scale renewable energy projects with a total capacity of more than 1600 MW across Australia China India Indonesia Japan and Singapore."

Cleveland also has a new midfield logo — an elf with a complicated history with former Ravens owner Art Modell.

“Brownie the Elf” a cartoon rendering of a mythical creature playing football that was an original logo of the Browns was revived ahead of the team’s season opener in September. The stiff-arming Brownie beat out another Brownie cartoon and two Browns helmet designs in fan voting for the team’s midfield logo. He’ll share the field with Watson for the first time in Saturday’s game against the Ravens.

Brownie’s exact origins are unclear. The inspiration for his design is believed to be the elf who adorned bottles of the Atlas Beverage Company’s Brownie caramel cream root beer. The company was based in Detroit but advertised the soda on the side of a building in downtown Massillon Ohio where Browns coach Paul Brown coached a high school team in the 1930s.

Team members and support people walk over the Cleveland Browns’ “Brownie the Elf” logo that has been painted as the midfield logo at FirstEnergy Stadium.

When Brown commissioned a local artist to create a logo for the school the final product was a Tiger named Obie who like Brownie is running with a football his right arm out and wearing a hat. When Brown was named the Browns’ head coach in 1946 Brownie the Elf came with him appearing in advertisement for tickets days before the Browns’ season opener against the Miami Seahawks.

Under Brown Cleveland won four straight All-America Football Conference championships led by stars like quarterback Otto Graham kicker and offensive tackle Lou Groza and fullback and linebacker Marion Motley. After the league dissolved in 1949 the Browns moved to the NFL where they continued to dominate winning league championships in 1950 1954 and 1955.

In 1961 the team was sold to a group led by New York advertising executive Art Modell. Brownie soon got the boot reportedly regarded as too childish. “My first official act as owner of the Browns” Modell told reporters at the time “will be to get rid of that little [expletive].”

In 1995 Modell announced he was moving the franchise from Cleveland to Baltimore leaving fans heartbroken and outraged. When the Browns under owner Al Lerner and team president and minority owner Carmen Policy brought the Browns back four years later Brownie was reinstated.

He was the team’s official training camp logo in 2006. He returned as a sideline mascot in 2015. And now Brownie’s back at midfield."

The Milwaukee Bucks are set to host the Utah Jazz tonight in the Fiserv Forum as they will want to redeem themselves and make up for a poor performance in their last game. But the Jazz on the other side won't make that an easy task.

Game preview

Although the Bucks are sitting firmly in the #2 seed with a 20-8 record a bad taste is left in their mouth after suffering their worst loss of the season in Memphis getting blown out by the Grizzlies 142-101.

The key for the Bucks like always will be the play of their MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo but unfortunately for them the Greek Freak might miss tonight's game. Antetokounmpo already missed a few games with a knee issue earlier in the season and that could sideline the superstar against Utah simply because of precaution.

Khris Middleton will also be out but Jrue Holiday should be returning after a two-game absence. If Jrue is the only part of the Big 3 that will be a hefty task for the point guard to handle. The play of the supporting cast will be crucial will all eyes pointed to the likes of Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis Jr.

On the other side the Utah Jazz has been one of the most pleasant surprises of the season. Everybody expected them to be one of the worst teams in the NBA but Will Hardy and his team defied critics and took the #1 seed early in the season. They cooled off after the hot start but they are still a tough team to face night in and night out standing 7th in the tight West with a 17-14 record.

Lauri Markkanen has been the star of this team playing the best basketball of his career and averaging 22.4 ppg and 8.6 rpg. But the secret to their success has been the team play and plethora of role players stepping up. Utah's distribution of the ball and style of play is really fun to watch and it makes them a formidable opponent for anyone.

In this file photo taken on December 13 2022 Stephen Curry #30 of the Golden State Warriors walks backcourt during a game against the Milwaukee Bucks at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee Wisconsin.

WASHINGTON — Four-time NBA champion Stephen Curry said Friday he was relieved that he won't need surgery on his partially dislocated left shoulder but had no timetable for his return.

Curry suffered the injury when he tried to make a steal during the reigning NBA champion Golden State Warriors' 125-119 loss at Indiana on Wednesday.

An MRI on Thursday showed the extent of the damage and confirmed he would not need an operation to repair the shoulder.

""From what I know about shoulder injuries and situations like that avoiding surgery is great news"" Curry said.

""I'll try to figure out how to get pain-free quickly get the strength back and work my way back into it appropriately.""

The 34-year-old superstar guard a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player said he would have missed at least the remainder of the season if surgery had been required.

""Surgery would have been four to six months"" Curry said. ""Nobody was trying to deal with that right now.""

Curry will be sidelined indefinitely as he prepares for rehabilitation work to begin once his shoulder no longer hurts.

""I've just got to trust the plan we have and do my work"" Curry said.

""There's a couple guys I've seen that had a little bit more severe cases their timelines. You kind of do your guesswork"" Curry said. ""You try to stay away me mentally from how long it's going to be because (the injury) will let me know.""

Regarding the possibility of surgery on the shoulder after the season Curry said ""It will let me know if that's necessary or not.""

Having been through injuries before notably left hand surgery in 2019 Curry is familiar with what must be done.

""Once you get pain-free you work on getting your mobility range of motion back strength back and all that and get back to basketball"" Curry said. ""Once you hurt something like this it becomes a little more unstable. Just trying to manage it as much as possible.""

Warriors 2-13 on road

The Warriors were off to a 14-15 start to stand 10th in the Western Conference when they lost Curry who led Golden State with 30.0 points and 6.8 assists a game and ranked second with 6.6 rebounds per contest.

""It's a matter of other guys stepping up"" Curry said. ""Every team goes through something like this during the year dealing with injuries your main guys being out. You've got to figure out how to perform and embrace the challenge.

""I'm confident in the guys we have on this team to figure it out.""

The Warriors are a woeful 2-13 on the road with the second-fewest wins away from home and level for the most road losses.

""This is a very important stretch because you want to maintain as much positivity and belief in what we're doing as possible and give ourselves a chance to finish the year strong"" Curry said.

Asked if it was important the Warriors manage a .500 mark during his absence Curry was matter-of-fact about Golden State's road troubles.

""That's always a good soundbite because it gives you something to key on"" Curry said. ""But where we're at we just want to win a road game."""

USA Today

BELLEVUE - Autokiniton will invest $15 million and create 150 new jobs to support its growing business in Sandusky County. Recently the Ohio Tax Credit Authority approved a Job Creation Tax Credit for the company.

Autokiniton 630 Southwest St. was awarded new business to manufacture frames for the Ford F150 Lightning electric truck according to a press release. The project includes a production assembly line featuring new equipment and machinery. Upgrades to the Bellevue plant will begin in January 2023 with production expected to launch in August 2023.

The Bellevue facility primarily supplies frames for Ford Motor Company. Inside the facility 360 associates operate and maintain an incredible array of automated assembly equipment working together to create quality parts with industry-leading precision and speed. Every two minutes a completed frame rolls off the assembly line — one of more than 200000 produced every year in Bellevue.

The corporation announced plans to utilize 43000 square feet of manufacturing space at the facility for new manufacturing work.

Reid Southby Chief Operating Officer for Autokiniton pointed to the Bellevue community and the current workforce as a key factor in the global company’s decision to expand at the Bellevue facility.

“We have a highly skilled and trained workforce which is critical when launching a new vehicle in the EV market” Southby said.

Autokiniton has 36 manufacturing and design facilities across the United States as well as additional manufacturing and design facilities in Mexico Brazil and India. In total Autokiniton has more than 8.3 million square feet of manufacturing floor space. Globally the company supports nearly every automotive manufacturer including emerging EV manufacturers.

Every two minutes a completed frame rolls off the assembly line — one of more than 200000 produced every year in Bellevue. The facility operates a state-of-the-art Electrocoat system that is capable of painting over a thousand frames each day. The facility also operates a rail spur where many of the frames are shipped to two Ford locations via train for final assembly.

“It is because of businesses like Autokiniton that we continue to see economic growth within Sandusky County” said Beth Hannam executive director of Sandusky County Economic Development Corporation. “We are excited to see their continued success for years to come and thank them for their continued investment in their Bellevue facility.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWduYXNpYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9mb3JkLXVuZGVyZ29lcy1pbnRlcm5hbC1icmFuZC10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi80ODI2NzXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford undergoes internal brand transformation | Marketing,"Ford has undergone an internal transformation with its new brand positioning “Adventurous Spirit”.

In a blog post supplied to Campaign Peter Zillig marketing director at Ford Europe said: “It’s the philosophy that will inform and add meaning to everything we do on our journey to reinvent the Ford product portfolio and customer experience in Europe.”

He explained that this new ethos would not feature in any advertising campaigns from the car marque but it was something Ford was seeking to embody with the launch of products in the future.

Zillig who joined Ford from Cheil UK in June 2020 said the company had spent a lot of time “introspecting” about what it wanted customers to feel when they came across the Ford brand.

He added: “Adventurous Spirit is the ethos that will help drive our transformation in Europe by helping us connect emotionally with consumers who say they know we’re American but don’t feel we’re American.”

Zillig cited the launch of Ford’s first all-electric vehicle Mustang Mach-E two years ago as being the first time the brand embodied “Adventurous Spirit”. During the launch Ford said the vehicle stood for “freedom progress fast performance and a touch of rebellion”.

As part of the brand transformation Ford has split its passenger vehicles into four categories: “Wild Performance” embodies the Mustang family; “Urban Escape” characterises models like Puma; “Active Adventure” defines SUVs such as Kuga; and “Ultimate Outdoor” defines Broncos and Ranger Raptors.

Speaking to Campaign Zillig said that Ford was set to launch a new all-electric vehicle in Europe next year and added that it would “live up to everything” described as “Adventurous Spirit”.

He added that the company had already begun testing its new brand platform in Germany where “Adventurous Spirit” is defining its product range customer experiences social interactions and dealer partner mindsets.

He said: “Our aim? When we ask consumers in future what they feel about Ford we want them to respond with the notion of Adventurous Spirit even if they don’t realise it. We want them to feel what we feel.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaG93LWRvZXMtZm9yZC1ibHVlLWNydWlzZS1oYW5kcy1mcmVlLWRyaXZpbmctd29yay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Does Ford's BlueCruise Hands-Free Driving Technology Work?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaG93LWRvZXMtZm9yZC1ibHVlLWNydWlzZS1oYW5kcy1mcmVlLWRyaXZpbmctd29yay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Prosecutors made the accusations in an indictment charging three media executives and a sports marketing company with a number of crimes including wire fraud and money laundering in connection with bribes to secure television and marketing rights for international soccer tournaments.

The accusations were the latest in a yearslong corruption case that has already produced convictions of numerous soccer officials and executives as well as depositions from former leaders of FIFA world soccer’s governing body. Never before though have prosecutors so clearly described the scheme that helped deliver the votes that gave Russia and Qatar hosting rights for one of the world’s biggest sporting events.

The U.S. prosecutors on Monday explicitly revealed details about money paid to five members of FIFA’s top board ahead of the 2010 vote to choose Russia and Qatar as hosts. Russia defeated England and joint bids from Holland-Belgium and Spain-Portugal to host the 2018 men’s tournament.

Missions for government agencies private companies as well as SpaceX’s own internet network were successfully launched Friday and Saturday from complexes in California and Florida.

Elon Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) in 2002 and has successfully launched nearly 200 missions in its two decades in existence.

Musk tweeted his congratulations on the accomplishment shortly after the third launch ""Congrats to SpaceX Team on 3 perfect orbital launches within 36 hours!!!""

If SpaceX can keep up the pace the company will likely continue to break records in the new year with dozens of launches already in the works including a historic journey around the moon by private astronauts.

Recent controversies surrounding Musk’s takeover of Twitter appear not to be having an impact on SpaceX’s operations or its lucrative relationship with NASA.

Both entities played vital roles in the recent mid-December missions.

MOON MISSION COMPLETE ORION SPACECRAFT BEGINS ROAD TRIP BACK TO KENNEDY SPACE CENTER

Saturday December 17 afternoon launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida

SpaceX capped off a busy 48 hours Saturday afternoon with a rocket launch of 54 Starlink satellites from the Kennedy Space Center.

The launch appeared to go smoothly at 4:32 p.m. and the company said the event set a record for the number of times a rocket booster has been reused for launches.

The reusable part of the rocket has now been used for 15 missions and has been recovered by a drone ship every time.

Falcon 9’s first stage landed on the ""Just Read the Instructions"" shortly after liftoff making it possible for the company to complete a sixteenth launch with the booster if it chooses.

SpaceX maintains its reusable rocket fleet has enabled the company to reduce costs of space travel and launch thousands of satellites into orbit.

Saturday’s payload of 54 Starklink satellites will add capabilities to SpaceX’s constellation network providing internet access to 40 countries.

Two telecommunications satellites rode aboard a Falcon 9 rocket into orbit after liftoff Friday from Florida’s east coast.

Similar to the Starlink mission SpaceX said the rocket’s booster successfully landed on the drone ship ""A Shortfall of Gravitas"" off the Florida coast.

SES a Europe-based telecommunications company said once the satellites are in operation the technology will enhance broadband coverage to remote regions around the world.

""Today with our second-generation O3b mPOWER we are bringing game-changing technology that delivers a unique combination of multiple gigabits per second of throughput at any location guaranteed reliability and service flexibility that is a first in the industry"" Steve Collar CEO of SES said in a statement. ""Whether we are enabling governments to carry out critical missions securely cruise operators to provide high-speed broadband access to passengers at all times or mobile network operators to deploy 4G/5G networks in underconnected areas or restore communications networks in down time O3b mPOWER is the satellite system of choice for applications where performance matters most.""

The purpose of competition law is aimed at ensuring that enterprises effect their market-based decisions in an independent manner (i.e. without the overt knowledge of what other enterprises may be considering). The general theory of harm posits that sitting on competitors’ boards is a recipe for receiving inside information and thus averting competition from occurring between the competing enterprises.

However does competition law really prohibit competitors from sitting on each other’s Boards? On the other hand why would any competitor want to or be allowed to sit on a fellow competitor’s board?

The Purpose/Object Clause and Functions of a Competition Authority

The purpose of competition law and the establishment of a competition authority is aimed at monitoring markets for any conduct or agreement that removes independent market decisions by market players. The preambular sections of legislation usually set the tone. For instance the object clause to the Competition and Consumer Protection Act No 24 of 2010 of Zambia (“CCP Act”) states that the purpose of the Act is to safeguard and promote competition; and to protect consumers against unfair trade practices. Section 5 of the CCP Act clothes the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (“CCPC”) with functions to: investigate and assess restrictive agreements abuse of dominant positions and mergers; investigate unfair trading practices and unfair contract terms and impose such sanctions as may be necessary; and do all such acts and things as are necessary incidental or conducive to the better carrying out of its functions under this Act. Would such functions touch on interfering with who sits on a Board?

Black’s Law Dictionary defines a “Board of Directors” as the “governing body of a corporation elected by the shareholders to establish corporate policy appoint executive officers and make major business and financial decisions2.” The relevant legislations provide the definition of who a director is. For instance the Companies Act of Zambia3 defines a director as:

“a person appointed as a member of the board of directors and includes an alternate director by whatever name designated”

It is most likely that any competition authority would be curious as to why and how any enterprise would allow a competitor to sit on its Board. Although it is common for Boards in a single economic unit to have interlocking directorships it is highly questionable for independent enterprises to do the same. In this regard are competitors prohibited from doing so in terms of competition law?

A Look at Southern Africa

On 12th September 2022 the Competition Commission of South Africa (“CCSA”) published the Draft Guidelines on the Exchange of Competitively Sensitive Information under the Competition Act (“Guidelines”).4 The gravamen of the document deals with the exchange of “competitively sensitive information.” In this respect the Guidelines define “competitively sensitive information” as5:

information that is important to rivalry between competing firms and likely to have an appreciable impact on one or more of the parameters of competition (for example price output product quality product variety or innovation). Competitively sensitive information could include prices customer lists production costs quantities turnovers sales capacities qualities marketing plans risks investments technologies research and development programmes and their results.

Looking at the definition of “competitively sensitive information” it is clear that competitors sitting on each other’s Boards would be likely to violate the intent and spirit of the Guidelines.

Is sitting on a competitor’s Board synonymous with a conspiracy to collude?

The subject of “collusion” is a central theme in competition law and viciously enforced under cartel or related horizontal prohibitions. While South Africa has the Guidelines indicated above there are no similar guidelines in any of the SADC Member States except that one should look closely at the definition of “agreement” which most legislations cover. The question would thus be couched: would a director sitting on a competitor’s board (with full knowledge) be deemed to have “agreed” to share “competitively sensitive information”?

The table below provides a snapshot of some of the key definitions in several SADC Member States’ competition legislations:

Country Botswana6 Eswatini7 Namibia8 South Africa9 Zambia10 Zimbabwe11 Conduct Agreement Any form of agreement whether or not legally enforceable entered into between enterprise and is implemented or intended to be implemented in Botswana

A decision by an association of enterprise

A concerted practice When used in relation to a prohibited practice includes a contract arrangement or understanding whether or not legally enforceable; Includes a contract arrangement or understanding whether or not legally enforceable; Includes a contract arrangement or understanding whether or not legally enforceable; Any form of agreement whether or not legally enforceable between enterprises which is implemented or intended to be implemented in Zambia and includes an oral agreement or a decision by a trade association or an association of enterprises “Restrictive practice” means— (a) any agreement  arrangement or understanding whether enforceable or not between two or more persons or (b) any business practice or method of trading; or (c) any deliberate act or omission on the part of any person whether acting independently or in concert with any other person; or (d) any situation arising out of the activities of any person or class of persons; which restricts competition directly or indirectly to a material degree…12 Collusion Not defined Not defined Not defined Not defined Not defined Not defined Tacit Collusion Not defined Not defined Not defined Not defined Not defined Not defined Concerted Practice Cooperative or coordinated conduct between enterprises achieved through direct or indirect contact that replaces their independent action but does not amount to an agreement Not defined deliberate conjoint conduct between undertakings achieved through direct or indirect contact that replaces their independent actions; Cooperative or coordinated conduct between firms achieved through direct or indirect contact that replaces their independent action but which does not amount to an agreement a practice which involves some form of communication or coordination between competitors falling short of an actual agreement but which replaces their independent action and restricts or lessens competition between them Not defined

From the foregoing the word “agreement” is so ambiguous and extensive in its application that it is easy to infer the existence of such an agreement across the selected countries based on interlocking directorship. Notably section 4(1)(a) of the Competition Act of South Africa is instructive in that it provides that an agreement between or concerted practice by firms or a decision by an association of firms is prohibited if it is between parties in a horizontal relationship13 and has the effect of substantially preventing or lessening competition in a market unless a party to the agreement concerted practice or decision can prove that any technological efficiency or other pro-competitive gain resulting from it outweighs that effect.

Section 4(2) of the South African Act14 presents the interesting presumption of the existence of an “agreement” where there is an interlocking directorship with a qualification as indicated below:

“An agreement to engage in a restrictive horizontal practice . . . is presumed to exist between two or more firms if –

anyone of those firms owns a significant interest in the other or they have at least one director or substantial shareholder in common; and any combination of those firms engages in that restrictive horizontal practice.”

The presumption is however not merely because of the interlocking directorship but rather a combination of the interlocking directorship followed by engagement in a restrictive horizontal practice. It therefore follows that interlocking directorship in and of itself is not a trigger to an assumption of the existence of a restrictive horizontal agreement until any combination of the firms in which the two or more directors engage in such conduct. There is however a possible rebuttal under section 4(3) of the same Act which provides that:

“A presumption contemplated in subsection (2) may be rebutted if a firm director or shareholder concerned establishes that a reasonable basis exists to conclude that the practice referred to in subsection (1)(b) was a normal commercial response to conditions prevailing in that market”.

The proposition of “competitively sensitive information” will be a good test in the near future of section 4(2) in South Africa. Other than the presumption under section 4(3) (supra) the South African legislation has gone further to encapsulate defenses even where there is a noted restrictive horizontal agreement in the market place which defenses are that15:

a company its wholly owned subsidiary as contemplated in section 1(5) of the Companies Act 1973 a wholly owned subsidiary of that subsidiary or any combination of them; or the constituent firms within a single economic entity similar in structure to those referred to in paragraph (a).

Interestingly there are no similar provisions in the respective competition legislations in Southern Africa of the countries surveyed under this article. In almost all the legislation the definition of “agreement” is however so broad as to allow for the interpretation of a competition authority tribunal or courts to include interlocking directorships as a prohibited horizontal agreement.

In addition to South Africa the Zimbabwean Competition Act’s definition of “restrictive practice” is so expansive that it would likely capture an interlocking directorship between competitors as an anti-competitive conduct on the face of it. Of course such a finding would be dependent on the evidence available to the Competition and Tariff Commission particularly regarding the observed market decisions of the specific competing enterprises sharing a director(s) (whether in the horizontal or vertical context) and the actual behavior of the director(s). Given the nascent stage of the development of home-grown competition law jurisprudence in a number of countries in Southern Africa it is most likely that a number of them would follow the approach of the South African competition authorities. Caution must however be sounded that any presumptions or defenses not expressly provided for in a specific national legislation would be a difficult plea before any such country’s adjudication panel.

Conclusion

It would be unwise for competitors to consciously share directors even where the law may not expressly be prohibitive of the practice or arrangement. The individual director must equally be wary of sitting on competing boards. The intent and spirit of competition law are to prevent the wanton sharing of “competitively sensitive information” amongst competitors. Equally there would be concerns of conflict of interest regarding corporate governance ethos.

Where interlocking director arrangements do exist enterprises are advised to seek legal counsel on how to adequately address associated risks by implementing the necessary checks and balances to avoid being framed as being part of a restrictive horizontal agreement. In other words interlocking directorship is a red flag that clients must be made aware of. A convergence of laws across countries in southern Africa would be a good step to ensure that their integrated economies are subject to a certain predictable level of competition enforcement mechanism.

Prosecutors made the accusations in an indictment charging three media executives and a sports marketing company with a number of crimes including wire fraud and money laundering in connection with bribes to secure television and marketing rights for international soccer tournaments.

The accusations were the latest in a yearslong corruption case that has already produced convictions of numerous soccer officials and executives as well as depositions from former leaders of FIFA world soccer’s governing body. Never before though have prosecutors so clearly described the scheme that helped deliver the votes that gave Russia and Qatar hosting rights for one of the world’s biggest sporting events.

The U.S. prosecutors on Monday explicitly revealed details about money paid to five members of FIFA’s top board ahead of the 2010 vote to choose Russia and Qatar as hosts. Russia defeated England and joint bids from Holland-Belgium and Spain-Portugal to host the 2018 men’s tournament. Qatar a tiny desert state that has spent billions of dollars to prepare for the 2022 World Cup defeated the United States in a runoff by a group of voters that had already been trimmed because two members had been secretly filmed agreeing to sell their votes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveHdlYXRoZXIuY29tL2VhcnRoLXNwYWNlL3NwYWNleC1yb2NrZXQtbGF1bmNoZXPSAUFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3h3ZWF0aGVyLmNvbS9lYXJ0aC1zcGFjZS9zcGFjZXgtcm9ja2V0LWxhdW5jaGVzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SpaceX caps off busy 48 hours with 3 successful rocket launches,"The company known to many around the world as SpaceX appears to be firing on all cylinders after completing three launches from the U.S. in less than 48 hours.

Missions for government agencies private companies as well as SpaceX’s own internet network were successfully launched Friday and Saturday from complexes in California and Florida.

Elon Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) in 2002 and has successfully launched nearly 200 missions in its two decades in existence.

Musk tweeted his congratulations on the accomplishment shortly after the third launch ""Congrats to SpaceX Team on 3 perfect orbital launches within 36 hours!!!""

If SpaceX can keep up the pace the company will likely continue to break records in the new year with dozens of launches already in the works including a historic journey around the moon by private astronauts.

Recent controversies surrounding Musk’s takeover of Twitter appear not to be having an impact on SpaceX’s operations or its lucrative relationship with NASA.

Both entities played vital roles in the recent mid-December missions.

MOON MISSION COMPLETE ORION SPACECRAFT BEGINS ROAD TRIP BACK TO KENNEDY SPACE CENTER

Saturday December 17 afternoon launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida

SpaceX capped off a busy 48 hours Saturday afternoon with a rocket launch of 54 Starlink satellites from the Kennedy Space Center.

The launch appeared to go smoothly at 4:32 p.m. and the company said the event set a record for the number of times a rocket booster has been reused for launches.

The reusable part of the rocket has now been used for 15 missions and has been recovered by a drone ship every time.

Falcon 9’s first stage landed on the ""Just Read the Instructions"" shortly after liftoff making it possible for the company to complete a sixteenth launch with the booster if it chooses.

SpaceX maintains its reusable rocket fleet has enabled the company to reduce costs of space travel and launch thousands of satellites into orbit.

Saturday’s payload of 54 Starklink satellites will add capabilities to SpaceX’s constellation network providing internet access to 40 countries.

IMPROVED SPACE WEATHER FORECASTS NEEDED TO AVOID DESTRUCTION OF SATELLITES

Friday December 16 evening launch from Cape Canaveral Florida

Around 24 hours before the Starlink launch SpaceX completed a mission known as O3b mPOWER.

Two telecommunications satellites rode aboard a Falcon 9 rocket into orbit after liftoff Friday from Florida’s east coast.

Similar to the Starlink mission SpaceX said the rocket’s booster successfully landed on the drone ship ""A Shortfall of Gravitas"" off the Florida coast.

SES a Europe-based telecommunications company said once the satellites are in operation the technology will enhance broadband coverage to remote regions around the world.

""Today with our second-generation O3b mPOWER we are bringing game-changing technology that delivers a unique combination of multiple gigabits per second of throughput at any location guaranteed reliability and service flexibility that is a first in the industry"" Steve Collar CEO of SES said in a statement. ""Whether we are enabling governments to carry out critical missions securely cruise operators to provide high-speed broadband access to passengers at all times or mobile network operators to deploy 4G/5G networks in underconnected areas or restore communications networks in down time O3b mPOWER is the satellite system of choice for applications where performance matters most.""

Caution must however be sounded that any presumptions or defenses not expressly provided for in a specific national legislation would be a difficult plea before any such country’s adjudication panel.

Conclusion

It would be unwise for competitors to consciously share directors even where the law may not expressly be prohibitive of the practice or arrangement. The individual director must equally be wary of sitting on competing boards. The intent and spirit of competition law are to prevent the wanton sharing of “competitively sensitive information” amongst competitors. Equally there would be concerns of conflict of interest regarding corporate governance ethos.

Where interlocking director arrangements do exist enterprises are advised to seek legal counsel on how to adequately address associated risks by implementing the necessary checks and balances to avoid being framed as being part of a restrictive horizontal agreement. In other words interlocking directorship is a red flag that clients must be made aware of. A convergence of laws across countries in southern Africa would be a good step to ensure that their integrated economies are subject to a certain predictable level of competition enforcement mechanism.

If we were to identify a single trend in the wearables market of 2022 it would be something along the lines of “bigger and better.” Rather than a stream of significant software innovation many companies turned to their tried and true formulas then dialed it up. We had Pros Pluses and an Ultra all with beefed-up specs added durability and rounded-out feature sets.

For many evolution over revolution paid off. But what was the very best wearable of the year? Our editorial and reviews teams chose one device as Android Authority’s Editor’s Choice winner for the best wearable of 2022 (plus four that came close).

How we chose our winner

Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority

One of those words that are so nuanced they almost mean everything and nothing at all “Best” is a title we don’t bestow lightly or easily. For starters the wearables market is a complex landscape. Gone are the days of effortlessly discerning trackers from smartwatches or high-end features from budget offerings. In short our wristwear simply does more than ever.

From durability to display performance sensor accuracy to third-party app support watches and trackers are bursting with comparables. That’s why we assess every wearable we encounter from top to bottom analyzing the value of each device for our readers. We pour hours (as well as literal sweat) into testing new launches updates and generational upgrades. We evaluate price points and companion apps to determine the value of the experience each device provides not just at purchase but over time as well.

First place can only go to the device that offers the most wholistic user experience.

When picking the Editor’s Choice for wearable of the year the stakes are higher than ever as are our standards. We rounded up a competitive shortlist of the highest-reviewed devices of the year from every major company and across every budget. From there our expert content managers and reviewers voted ranking their top five picks. The votes have been tallied and here are the results!

Android Authority‘s Editor’s Choice wearable of the year: Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro

Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority

In 2021 the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 took home the top spot for the best wearable of 2021. We were thoroughly impressed by the launch of the Wear OS 3 platform and found that key software updates throughout the year continued to strengthen the device’s hold in the market. In short Samsung found its groove. This year the company launched an even more refined and feature-packed wearable and won our first-place pick once again.

The souped-up Galaxy Watch 5 with a Pro moniker features a titanium case a show-stopping AMOLED display with a Sapphire glass lens and a MIL-STD-810H durability rating. It’s a testament to Samsung’s ability to evolve for niche users while also leaning into the line’s winning formula. Sure Samsung omitted the fan-favorite rotating bezel but we fell in love with the device’s new D-buckle band that offers both a premium look and an even better fit.

The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro proves Samsung has forged itself an admirable lead in the Wear OS arena at least for now.

On the smartwatch front Wear OS remains a powerful platform and the watch offers everything from phone call and contactless payment support to music storage and notifications. Google Assistant is even baked in out of the box to the relief of shoppers everywhere. Thanks to the Google Play Store the device offers ample third-party app support for anything not found natively. For those in the Samsung ecosystem the watch also offers useful SmartThings integration.

Meanwhile for hikers cyclists and outdoor enthusiasts the flagship adds useful navigation features (and even better GPS accuracy) to its already robust fitness tracking suite. These include Track Back (for finding your way back to the parking lot) and a useful Route tile that leverages users’ ability to upload GPX files for turn-by-turn navigation. On the health front the device still offers Samsung’s “BioActive” sensor trio plus on-device ECG measurements (albeit not in the US) and blood pressure monitoring for Samsung phone users.

Despite all its features and sensors the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro also boasts improved battery life by housing a 590mAh cell and offers faster charging. Users can expect about two full days with regular usage and a full charge in 90 minutes. That means more time on your wrist whether you’re counting Zs or adventuring outside.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro Up to 2 days battery life • Advanced sleep tracker • Fast Charging MSRP: $449.99 Samsung's first adventure watch is a winner Building on the Galaxy Watch 5's base with a much hardier body Galaxy Watch 5 Pro also features multiple health and fitness tracking tools a bigger battery and a better navigation system. All these improvements make for a great all-round smartwatch whether you're in the boardroom or out on the trail. See price at Amazon Save $75.99 See price at Samsung

Second place: Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

While the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro claimed more than 25% of the total points in our vote the next 20% of points went to Garmin’s powerhouse of a GPS watch: the Forerunner 955 Solar. And by powerhouse we mean an eco-friendly green one as this year the flagship device brought solar charging to the premium fitness-tracking line. With its bevy of upgraded sensors unmatched GPS accuracy and an endless list of sport modes the Forerunner 955 is easily the best device on this list for dedicated runners.

Unlike our first-place pick the Forerunner 955 is compatible with both Android and iOS phones opening it up to more potential users. It also offers nearly two weeks of use between charges making it a godsend for anyone who considers battery life the end-all-be-all. In fact if harnessing the power of the sun and digging into performance stats were the ultimate goal it would easily usurp Samsung’s crown. As it stands the Forerunner 955 takes second place among the top wearables of 2022.

Third place: Garmin Venu 2 Plus

Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority

The Forerunner is joined on the podium by another Garmin favorite the Venu 2 Plus. A bit of context: In 2021 the Venu 2 earned the runner-up spot for the best wearable of the year. When its successor launched at CES 2022 we immediately dubbed it the best wearable launched at the event.

Nearly a year later we’re still smitten. The Venu 2 Plus proves Garmin can round out its reputable fitness-tracking tools with enough daily-use features (namely phone call and voice assistant support) to earn a seat at the smartwatch table.

Fourth place: Apple Watch Ultra

Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority

We don’t often celebrate an Apple Watch for its innovations since the Cupertino-based company tends to rinse and repeat. This year though Apple dropped a massive (literally) departure from the status quo with the Apple Watch Ultra.

An eye-catching oversized display bright orange Action Button durability specs you can take deep sea diving and a temperature sensor for advanced health insights make this the most impressive Apple Watch yet and the fourth best wearable of 2022. It also boasts the longest-lasting battery on an Apple Watch to date.

Fifth place: Fitbit Inspire 3

Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority

We’ve rarely seen a wearables list that doesn’t feature a Fitbit in some capacity and this one is no exception. The company squeezes into fifth place with its latest budget tracker an entry-level device with incredible value.

Between its new colorful touchscreen display reliable 24/7 health and fitness tracking data-rich sleep tracking suite and impressive battery life the Inspire 3 is the perfect example of a trusted brand doing the basics right. It’s also the most affordable way to dip a toe into the Fitbit ecosystem and tap into one of the best companion apps in the game. For these reasons the Inspire 3 earns its spot on the 2022 wall of fame.

While our wearable of the year is all wrapped up check in with Android Authority throughout the holiday season for more 2022 wrap-ups and fun end-of-year articles. We’ll also be sharing plenty of pieces looking ahead to the tech landscape of 2023.

Until then we wish all our readers a very happy holidays!

(KPHO/Gray News) - Authorities in Arizona say a sheriff’s son and granddaughter died in a crash on Friday afternoon.

KPHO reports officers were called to reports of a collision in the Gilbert area involving a pickup truck and a Toyota Corolla at about 3:45 p.m.

According to police the Toyota appeared to turn in front of the pickup truck while it attempting to make a left turn. The truck then struck the vehicle.

A 22-year-old man and an infant were passengers inside the Toyota. Police said they died at the scene while the female driver was transported to the hospital with life-threatening injuries.

Authorities later identified the 22-year-old as Cooper Lamb Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb’s son with the infant being the sheriff’s 1-year-old granddaughter. The Toyota driver was also Cooper Lamb’s fiance.

Last night Sheriff Lamb lost his son Cooper Lamb along with his one-year-old granddaughter in a crash in Gilbert.... Posted by Pinal County Sheriff's Office on Saturday December 17 2022

The driver of the pickup truck wasn’t injured in the crash according to police. Officers said it appeared he was going the speed limit at the time of the collision but was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence.

Police did not immediately identify the pickup truck driver but said the crash remains under investigation.

GE Aerospace has shared more details about the hybrid-electric technology demonstration project that was awarded funding in October under Europe’s Clean Aviation research program. Called AMBER the program will be led by GE’s Italian business unit Avio Aero to study the integration of hybrid-electric components with fuel cells. GE Avio Aero leads four-year hybrid-electric and hydorgen project.

The four-year AMBER project was awarded €34 million from Clean Aviation but the terms stipulate that the project has to be funded for at least the same amount as private or other funding. This and technological knowhow will be provided by 21 partners which include various business units of GE Aerospace in Germany Poland the Czech Republic and Turkey universities in Italy and the Czech Republic Leonardo German Aerospace Center (DLR) Fraunhofer and others.

GE has been working with NASA on a 1 Megawatt-class hybrid-electric powertrain for application on commercial aircraft which Boeing joined earlier this year. During the Farnborough Airshow GE Aerospace revealed that the engine had been successfully tested in conditions that simulate flight conditions at 45.000 feet.

AMBER goes a step further and intends to integrate the components of the hybrid-electric system like the power converters transmission and the motor/generator with hydrogen fuel cells. These are provided by German company H2FLY which is also responsible for the build-up of the system as part of the validation and testing. Avio Aero will modify a GE Catalyst engine to make it suitable for hydrogen. Leonardo will look at aircraft integration.

The system will be tested on a ground rig around 2025 only but looks at applications on future engine concepts like the CFM RISE open rotor of the use one gas turbine engines that use sustainable aviation fuels. “We are looking to design develop and test breakthrough technologies to shape the future of more sustainable flight in Europe and we appreciate the collaboration with Clean Aviation to make this demonstrator possible” said Avio Aero Vice President of Engineering Giorgio Abrate.

GE Avio is also involved in three other Clean Aviation projects that were awarded funding in October. The first is called HYDEA and looks at hydrogen combustion. Avio Aero is working together with Safran Aircraft Engines Airbus and other companies and universities. This project is intended to reach the flight test phase which will likely happen on the Airbus A380 demonstrator in 2026 that already will test a GE Passport engine with direct-burn of hydrogen.

Another project is OFELIA which is led by Safran and studies ultra-efficient propulsion systems for short and medium-range aircraft. OFELIA adopts the open rotor architecture also used on RISE and plans to test it on the A380.

The HERA project is supervised by Leonardo and aims to define concepts of regional aircraft that have thirty to fifty percent lower emissions compared to current-generation aircraft specifically by using hybrid-electric technology. Avio Aero is a partner in this.

This is clear from a post on Twitter by the account International Defense Analysis. In the post announcing the development and delivery of the mission computer for the aircraft photos of the finished integrated circuits of the computer were shared.

Twitter screenshot

“5th generation National Combat Aircraft [MMU] mission computer successfully produced by TÜBİTAK BİLGEM and delivered to TAI” the tweet said. BulgarianMilitary.com recalls that on November 26 Turkey revealed the work on the production of the first prototype of the Turkish fifth-generation TF-X aircraft.

The mission computer is essential to the functioning of the TF-X. It will have to perform encrypted data transfer. Turkey has experience in developing its own mission computer especially in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles. The Turkish mission computer will have a radar receiver which sources say was developed by the Turkish company Aselsan. In the future when the aircraft flies and is put into operational readiness the mission computer in the TF-X cockpit will control the fire control system the laser warning system the dosing system and the silencing system.

TF-X engine

TF-X will be powered by two engines is clear from the published photos. Also the body of the TF-X is already assembled. The prototype will be powered by American GE F110 engines. These engines power a large number of two famous American fighter jets the F-15E Strike Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. However Turkey is developing its own engine.

According to local analysts and sources in the Turkish defense industry the Turkish engine will have to approach the characteristics of the GE F110. However there are other opinions about the future engine the most popular being that if Turkey fails to develop its own engine it may agree with the US to manufacture the GE F110 under patent.

The first flight of the first TF-X prototype should take place in 2025 according to the manufacturer’s plans following the plans of the Turkish Air Force and the Ministry of Defense.

The display of the mission computer is the second piece of good news in the TF-X project after the display of the assembled airframe. In this way Ankara is showing the world and its partners as well as possible future customers that despite the initial difficulties Turkey is determined to produce the aircraft and at least get to prototype testing.

Good news

If it is good news for Turkey the progress on the TF-X is bad news for the partners in the arms business especially the US. Turkey has decided to develop its own fighter jet to reduce foreign influence on arms supplies to the Turkish military as well as to begin a gradual modernization of its air fleet. For the most part this air fleet is made up of American F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters.

The progress in the production of the TF-X prototype is good news for Pakistan as well. Pakistan is a participant in the project and this became clear in February this year when Temel Kotil executive director of Turkish Aerospace Industries [TUSAS] and Rizvan Riaz vice marshal of the Pakistan Air Force [PAF] confirmed that Pakistan was already involved.

Details about the cooperation between the two countries both then and now have not yet been revealed. But Turkey says the new TF-X will follow the principles and operational requirements of the two countries air forces. BulgarianMilitary.com recalls that Pakistan also operates a certain number of American F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters. Pakistan will contribute to the development and production of the TF-X with its experience over the past decade in the development and joint production of China’s JF-17 Thunder.

Problems in the past

However the TF-X went through many obstacles to get to where it is today. Turkey had a strong desire for TF-X to become really long before today’s date. The main problem was the engine which had to be German in the first place. But Germany subsequently the US imposed an embargo on arms supplies to Turkey. First because of the proxy conflict between Turkey and Greece then because of the purchase of Russian S-400 air defense systems from Moscow. In reality the two GE F110 engines that will power the prototype were not purchased now but long before the S-400 arrived on Turkish soil.

Gradually however the differences are smoothed out. Washington is on the verge of allowing Ankara to purchase at least 40 F-16 Block 70 fighters as well as to upgrade a large number of Turkey’s F-16 inventory.

Comac adds that the jet’s delivery comes under the auspices of China’s Belt and Road Initiative which seeks to expand Chinese investment and infrastructure internationally.

It is not clear however when the aircraft will enter service for TransNusa. The jet already bears an Indonesian registration: PK-TJA (MSN186).

Images on Chinese social media show that the delivery took place at a Comac hangar in Shanghai on 18 December.

Images of the aircraft in TransNusa livery started emerging on Chinese social media during 2022.

TransNusa however has yet to comment on the delivery and its plans for the type.

The delivery stems from China Aircraft Leasing’s (CALC’s) placing of an order for 30 ARJ21s with TransNusa in January 2021.

According to a CALC stock exchange filing announcing the order and placement the jets are to be delivered “in stages” up to 2026.

CALC holds a stake in TransNusa via Aviation Synergy (Caymen) which in turn owns Naga Pacific Holdings which has a 49% stake in TransNusa according to filings on the Hong Kong stock exchange.

CALC holds a 72.8% stake in Aviation Synergy while its chief executive officer Mike Poon and deputy chief Winnie Liu hold 14.1% and 13.1% respectively.

Cirium fleets data shows that in addition to the 30 ARJ21s on order TransNusa operates a pair of Airbus A320s and a single A320neo.

FlightGlobal has reached out to Comac and TransNusa for comment.

A team of researchers led by Dr. Samuli Arvola of Turku University in Finland evaluated the use of a shorter SPECT acquisition protocol on the diagnostic performance of whole-body technetium-99m hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (Tc-99m HMDP) SPECT/CT in prostate cancer patients. The technique reduced total acquisition time from 40 minutes to as low as 16 minutes without any loss of diagnostic performance they found.

Such shorter acquisition times could help clinicians potentially increase the use of accurate whole-body SPECT imaging in these patients the authors suggest.

""Whole-body Tc-99m HMDP-SPECT/CT can be acquired using a general-purpose CZT system in less than 20 minutes without any loss in diagnostic performance in metastasis staging of high-risk prostate cancer patients"" the group wrote.

Whole-body bone SPECT/CT is a more accurate method than standard planar bone scintigraphy and CT for detecting bone metastases in cancer patients yet its clinical use is limited partly due to the lack of fast acquisition protocols according to the authors.

Current recommendations suggest an acquisition time for whole-body SPECT/CT of at least 40 minutes but this guidance was written prior to the development of general-purpose digital cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) systems which allow optimization of acquisition protocols including imaging time they added.

In this study Arvola's team explored whether a Discovery NM/CT 670 CZT system (GE Healthcare) installed at Turku University Hospital could be used to cut acquisition times in a group of patients with prostate cancer a type with high rates of metastatic bone tumors.

The group studied imaging from 30 prostate cancer patients who previously underwent 50-minute Tc-99m HMDP-SPECT/CT scans from the top of the head to the mid-thigh. Fifteen patients had bone metastases and the other 15 had only benign findings. The acquired images were then resampled to produce data sets with shorter acquisition times of 41 38 32 26 20 and 16 minutes. Experienced nuclear medicine physicians qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the images.

The investigators found that the originally acquired images had the best qualitative image quality and lowest noise. But reduced acquisition time had no effect on the diagnostic performance of the physician readers: Sensitivity specificity and accuracy for identifying cancer targets did not significantly differ between the 50-minute and reduced acquisition time images.

Ultimately acquisition time is an important factor regarding the feasibility of whole-body bone SPECT/CT for imaging bone metastases. With shorter acquisition times use could increase significantly the authors wrote.

""[Our study validates the feasibility of] fast whole-body bone SPECT/CT in prostate cancer patients"" Arvola and colleagues concluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Why you can trust Laptop Mag Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

Wireless earbud makers are cranking out models faster than ever these days and JLab is leading the charge. Instead of releasing new sporty models the company chose to update several of their most popular entries: the JBuds Air Sport (3rd Gen) JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) Epic Air ANC (2nd Gen) and Epic Air Sport ANC (2nd Gen). We got our hands on the latter to determine whether the upgrade was necessary.

JLab JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen): Specifications Price: $69 Colors: Black Battery life (rated): 7 hours (ANC on); 10 hours (ANC off); 24 hours (charging case with ANC on); 40 hours (charging case with ANC off) Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.2 Water resistance: Yes (IP55 rated) Size: 1.24 x 0.71 x 0.80 (per bud); 2.96 x 1.64 x 1.45 inches (charging case) Weight: 0.2 ounces (per bud); 1.8 ounces (charging case)

Inclusions like built-in Tile support and a customizable EQ sound enticing. The same can be said about the incredibly affordable and unchanged price: $69. Unfortunately you’re getting much of the same performance as the original which is fine for exercisers on a budget but not everyone else.

Read our full JLab JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) review for the full breakdown.

JLab JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) review: Availability and price

You can buy the JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) for $69 directly from JLab. Black is the only color sold. Inside the box are a charging case three sets of different-sized gel tips one set of Cloud Foam tips one set of cush fins a quick start guide and a two-year warranty.

These buds share the same MSRP as the original and are some of least expensive noise-cancelling earbuds out there. By comparison they are listed lower than the well-received Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 ($99) and category leaders such as the AirPods Pro ($249) and Sony WF-1000XM4 ($279).

Be sure to bookmark our headphone deals page for the latest sales.

JLab JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) review: Design and comfort

The earbud design was left untouched which is both good and bad. You still get solid build quality and IP55-rated protection against dust excessive sweat and heavy splashing. The silver debossed logo is there for instant brand recognition. On the opposite end the buds are large and stick out a like sore thumb. I would have liked to see more color options as well.

(Image credit: Alex Bracetti/Future)

A copy-and-paste job was also performed on the charging case. The pill-shaped design returns with signature features intact like the integrated charging cable and three LEDs. At least it’s easily portable and durable enough to withstand the daily abuse you’ll put these buds through on commutes and at the gym.

(Image credit: Alex Bracetti/Future)

Speaking of exercise the JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) provides a quality fit. The tips form a tight seal and the cush fins wrap around the cymba (upper inside part of the ear). I jogged around several blocks and never had to readjust the buds. JLab’s proprietary Cloud Foam tips are also a suitable alternative to memory foam tips molding to your ears over time for a more personalized fit.

(Image credit: Alex Bracetti/Future)

Comfort is another story. The large size occupies most of your ear plus the hard plastic presses up against the concha and causes soreness after an hour of wear.

JLab JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) review: Controls and digital assistant

A full suite of media controls is available with functions individually assigned to single-/double-/triple-press and long-hold gestures on each bud. These include playback call management volume digital assistance power on/off and different listening mode activations. I’m not a fan of the default controls but JLab lets you change them in the companion app.

(Image credit: Alex Bracetti/Future)

Touch accuracy has improved from previous JLab releases but still requires a lot of work. Single and double taps work well. Everything else doesn’t. I had to perform the triple tap and long-hold input methods several times to execute intended commands. Another annoyance was the lack of tone prompts when initiating commands; this made it difficult to determine whether ANC was on or off.

Wear detection can be unlocked by downloading the latest firmware update. Whether or not you’ll gain access to it is a crapshoot because JLab’s software is one buggy mess. I was not able to download and test the feature.

(Image credit: Alex Bracetti/Future)

Siri and Google Assistant are compatible for voice commands. JLab’s four-mic array isn’t the most intelligible but it picks up most words and understands small requests like “open Gmail” or “play Apple Music.” The feature does struggle with more in-depth requests like “what is my next event.”

JLab JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) review: Audio quality

JLab is known for its aggressive sound and that hasn’t changed with the JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen). The strong bass performance is ideal for fitness buffs that want to get their adrenaline pumping before a workout but the weak mids and highs will turn off audiophiles.

Four EQs are programmed into the buds: Signature (the default) Balanced Bass Boost and Custom. While the Custom EQ allows for manual adjustment of bass mid-range and treble it does a poor job of translating the results. Bass Boost overemphasizes the low end producing some fuzz in the process and it diminishes the mid-range. Balanced tries to even out frequency range and doesn’t get the job done reducing bass and highs in the process. Signature is the only EQ that produces acceptable sound.

(Image credit: Alex Bracetti/Future)

Sean Paul’s “Temperature” helped build some momentum before heading out on a run. The pounding drum patterns and claps slapped hard. Vocals were also transparent over the boomy production.

The JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) couldn’t handle the grumbling bassline and synthesized effects on Tame Impala’s “New Person Same Old Mistakes” coming on too strong and blanketing the naturally thin-sounding vocals. Instrumental recordings didn’t fare well either mostly muddying up the double bass and giving highs very little presence; I could barely hear any cymbals and piano notes on jazz tracks.

(Image credit: Alex Bracetti/Future)

Oddly listening with ANC on cleared up the mid-range a little.

SBC and AAC are the supported codecs and each worked well when streaming on Android and iOS/macOS devices. aptX would have increased performance but it’s understandable why JLab chose to exclude it when factoring in price.

JLab JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) review: Active noise cancellation

JLab lets you adjust noise cancellation between 19 levels via slider in the app. Having it set to max level will earn you the best results. The technology can handle common noises like humming sounds from an AC unit and rowdy pedestrians. It’ll even minimize the harsh sounds produced by brisk winds. That’s about it.

(Image credit: Alex Bracetti/Future)

My ears picked up on several noises during strolls with my baby boy. Some that caught my attention were car horns dog barking dump trucks and the water fountain splashing in front of my apartment complex. High-frequency noises like ambulance sirens and my son’s cries were loudly audible.

(Image credit: Alex Bracetti/Future)

Surprisingly JLab’s ambient listening mode (Be Aware) is one of the better-performing ones at this price point. The mics open wide to let in a lot of noise around you – maybe a little too wide. It was nice to hear my wife from across the room and converse without having to take out the buds. Construction work and oncoming traffic were also perceptible. However the transparency effect can be overwhelming and harmful to your hearing when caught in loud settings.

JLab JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) review: App and special features

JLab was one of the first to introduce a companion app for their inexpensive line of wireless earbuds. The JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) is compatible with the JLab Sound app granting access to all aforementioned features including ANC/Be Aware Customize Controls and Equalizer.

(Image credit: Alex Bracetti/Future)

Battery level indicators for each bud and firmware updates make up the rest of the app though as previously stated the latter is extremely buggy. Downloading the latest software was impossible; the app crashed whenever reaching 50 percent. The latest update is said to “offer improved microphone performance during calls” and “improves the auto play/pause performance in direct sunlight.” I was unable to experience either.

The older JLab Store app is still available with the Audio Burn-In tool which lets you play extremely loud static to break the buds in for enhanced sound quality. No expert I know uses it. In addition the process can take several hours but it’s available if you want it.

Tile integration is the big feature added to these buds though it requires downloading the Tile app for use. Essentially it acts as a Find My Buds function to easily track misplaced or lost buds. You can set up the volume and smart alarms for the product. It’s reliable.

JLab JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) review: Battery life and charging case

Battery life hasn’t changed at all from the original. A full charge is rated at 7 hours with ANC on and 10 hours with ANC off. Our testing saw these playtimes short by about 1 hour. In any case what you get is sufficient for about 2-4 days of moderate use (2 hours daily). Anything longer than the AirPods Pro 2 (5.5 to 7 hours) is fine in my book.

The charging case is the same as well. It can hold between 24 to 40 hours depending how you use the buds. A 15-minute quick charge generates up to 1 hour of listening time. Not the fastest nor the slowest but we’ve seen plenty of sub-$100 models operate at faster paces (see what the OnePlus Buds Z can achieve).

The bigger issue I have is the outdated charging cable that not many devices support anymore. This forces you to use a wall plug or portable charger with a USB-A port to recharge the buds. Can we please get a USB-C cable JLab?

Wireless charging was not added this time around.

JLab JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) review: Call quality and connectivity

Call quality is bad. According to several people I was muffled and background noises cut off my voice when speaking sentences. Performance was at its worst when taking calls indoors. My wife noticed even more muffle and pointed out some echoing on my end.

(Image credit: Alex Bracetti/Future)

These buds operate on Bluetooth 5.2. The technology performs up to par. Range extended up to 50 feet in open spaces. Connectivity was strong during calls and streaming sessions. Pairing with iOS and Android devices was a breeze specifically on the latter where one-tap Google Fast Pair expedited the process.

Multipoint technology (pair to two devices simultaneously) did not make the cut.

JLab JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) review: Verdict

The JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) doesn’t meet the high expectations of a next-gen product. At the same time it offers more in performance than most sub-$70 wireless earbuds. Sound is serviceable for those with bass-heavy playlists. Additions like the custom EQ and Tile integration are welcomed. Battery life and construction are also dependable for the price.

JLab’s noise-cancelling technology isn’t going to wow anyone nor will its call quality or buggy companion app which makes accessing new features frustrating.

There are other cheap noise-cancelling earbuds worth recommending like the $59 1More PistonBuds Pro but the JBuds Air ANC (2nd Gen) can be of value for hardcore exercisers that want nothing more than sporty aesthetics and strong bass from an audio workout companion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2hvbWUvYW1hem9uLWVjaG8tdGlwcy1hbmQtdHJpY2tzL9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2hvbWUvYW1hem9uLWVjaG8tdGlwcy1hbmQtdHJpY2tzLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best Amazon Echo tips and tricks,"Amazon Echo devices are some of the most popular smart home hubs on the market.

Change Alexa’s name or create a nickname for her to call you

Once you’ve got your Alexa device up and running on your Wi-Fi network there are still a few more things you might want to do before diving in so be sure to head over to echo.amazon.com or download the accompanying smartphone app.

First off if your name is Alexa or something similar (like Alexis) you’ll definitely want to change the “wake” word for the device. To do so choose your device in the app then choose Wake Word and select your desired wake word which can be “Amazon” “Echo” “Alexa” or “Computer.” You can also change the name Alexa calls you. Go to the Communicate section in the Alexa app and you can edit your name under My profile and settings.

Create separate profiles for each person in your home

If multiple people in your home have Amazon accounts you can create separate profiles for each person in your Alexa household profile. To do so open your Alexa app then tap on Settings> Account Settings> Amazon Household and follow the on-screen directions.

With more than one account on your Echo you can not only share content like music and movies but you can also collaborate on shopping lists to-do lists and calendars. If you can’t remember whose account is logged in ask “Alexa which profile am I using?” To switch to your own say “Alexa switch profile.” It’s that easy.

If your significant other has drastically different taste in music than you do fear not. Alexa can also recognize your voice and play songs from your very own playlist. You’ll want to make sure to set up a voice profile which entails completing a series of prompts. After you set that up Alexa will recognize your voice across all your Alexa-enabled devices.

Personalize your Alexa experience

There are a number of third-party developers who have created skills for Alexa including games quizzes and fitness routines. We’ve compiled a list of Alexa’s most useful Skills in case you’re looking to add oomph to what your virtual assistant can do.

Previously if you wanted to add a new skill you had to do so manually. Thankfully you can now easily add a new skill with your voice. If you’d like to learn how to be a mixologist in your spare time for example you can simply say “Alexa enable the Bartender skill.” With more than 10000 recipes to choose from you’ll be a professional barkeep in no time.

You can create your own skills using Alexa Skills Blueprints. You can do things like create your own quizzes play game shows or leave directions for your pet sitter or babysitter. You can even publish the skills you create to the Alexa skills store upon approval and other Alexa users can use your skills and give them a rating.

Enhance your Alexa privacy

Maybe you ask Alexa embarrassing questions or perhaps you simply don’t want the virtual assistant saving all your voice recordings. You can delete individual recordings by going to Settings> Alexa Privacy in the app. Here you have a variety of options including managing your Alexa data and viewing your specific voice history. To delete a recording select it and tap Delete voice recordings.

You can delete recordings for the entire day week or month or even delete your entire recordings history. Under Manage your Alexa data you can also set it up to have your recordings automatically deleted. You can manage other aspects of your privacy as well (such as your smart home device history).

Guest Connect to other Echo devices

Want to connect to someone else’s Echo to access your Alexa account? If you’re over at a friend’s house you can use Guest Connect to temporarily connect using their compatible device. You just need an Alexa account an Alexa voice profile and a phone number linked to your Alexa account. If you have those things you can just say “connect to my account” to get started with Guest Connect. Once you’re in Alexa uses voice recognition and then gives you access to your music and news.

Get help in the kitchen

Since your hands are busy chopping or simply covered in food Alexa can be a big help in the kitchen whether you need her to set a 10-minute timer or convert ounces to cups. If you’re deciding what to make for dinner and notice you’re out of coriander you can ask Alexa to add it to your shopping list. If you’ve bought paper towels from Amazon Prime before you can reorder them by saying “Alexa reorder paper towels.” If your kids are ordering too many cookies you can turn off voice ordering or require a confirmation code.

Other features are also very helpful when it comes to meal preparation. The Food Network skill for example gives you access to an extensive library of recipes. You can ask Alexa a series of questions to help you decide what sounds best (or most convenient) for dinner. Simply say “Alexa ask Food Network for the recipes on TV right now” or “Alexa ask Food Network for recipes from Alton Brown.”

If you own a GE Wi-Fi Connect appliance meal prep is even easier. The Geneva skill for Alexa allows you to control these devices with your voice. Simply request this by saying “Alexa enable Geneva skill.” You’ll then need to link your GE Wi-Fi Connect account but once that’s done you’ll be able to ask Alexa an amalgam of useful questions as well as prompt the assistant to activate various household appliances. You can say “Alexa tell Geneva to preheat my oven to 400 degrees” or “Alexa ask Geneva if my laundry is dry.”

Several other appliances either have Alexa integration or are Alexa-compatible. For example the LG Instaview ThinQ Smart Refrigerator is a fridge with a screen and Alexa built in meaning that you can literally ask your fridge what to make for dinner. Alexa has other functionality too. Let’s say for example you still managed to burn dinner — even with all of your digital assistant’s help. That’s okay. There’s now a skill to help you quickly order a Domino’s pizza. This skill along with more than 85000 others and counting is available in the Skills section of the Alexa app. You can also ask Alexa about nearby restaurants whenever you’re in a pickle.

It’s best to use appliances supported by Alexa. However you may already own smart appliances that don’t work with Alexa out of the box. Luckily there is a way of pairing these appliances. If your device isn’t supported by Alexa but is supported by IFTTT you can set up a series of triggers to establish support and functionality. IFTTT has even curated an entire catalog of command triggers specifically for Alexa.

Start your morning with Alexa

Alexa is more than willing to help you start and end your day. The Echo Dot 4th Gen with Led Clock has a display timer right on the front that adjusts to the lighting in the room. Saying “Alexa set an alarm” will prompt the assistant to ask for a time and you can set your 7 a.m. wake-up call for every day weekdays weekends or just on Thursdays. You can even set your alarm so that you wake to Bruno Mars Eminem or whoever you like to hear in the morning. Depending on which device you have you can set and disable alarms with your voice via the screen (Spot and Show only) or in the app. Forgot when you’re supposed to wake up tomorrow? Just ask “Alexa when is my alarm?”

When your alarm goes off in the morning you can ask Alexa for traffic weather and news briefings. The Echo Spot Dot and other Amazon devices can also tell you what is on your Google Calendar or you can add an event. Not only does Alexa support Google Calendar but it also works with your Outlook Microsoft and Apple calendars. Oh and if you’re running late you can even call an Uber or a Lyft with Alexa.

There are also plenty of products to help Alexa adjust the atmosphere in your bedroom. When you’re ready for bed you can ask Alexa to turn off the lights and lower the thermostat or just set a routine to do all of those things at once by saying “Alexa good night.” Of course you’ll also need to have enabled specific Alexa-compatible devices in order to do so. The Philips Hue skill for example works specifically with Philips Hue lights to help you control the lighting around your home. Simply say “Alexa turn on Relax in Bedroom” and the lights in your room will dim or brighten to your preferred setting.

As for other features flash briefings are a great way to stay up-to-date on the latest news and tidbits while you’re getting your day started. Flash briefings essentially function as pre-recorded updates courtesy of popular broadcasters such as NPR BBC News The Economist and Slate among others (including Digital Trends!). If you want longer more detailed news briefings Alexa offers long-form briefings too. To use the flash briefing feature you’ll first need to find enable and manage your flash briefing content. Go to Menu > Setting > Flash Briefings in the app to set it up. After you’ve tailored your flash briefings to your liking you can just say “Alexa what’s my Flash Briefing?”

Use your Echo as a watchdog

Did you know your Echo device can bark at intruders like a dog? We’re not kidding. With Alexa Guard and Alexa Guard Plus enabled your Echo device turns into a surveillance device. The smart speaker will listen for deliberate noises like breaking glass and smoke alarms and ping your mobile devices with alerts.

Alexa Guard is completely free to use. For $4.99 a month you can upgrade to Alexa Guard Plus netting you extra benefits like 24/7 emergency response support and the aforementioned dog barking byte. To enable the feature open the Alexa app and navigate to More> Settings> Guard. The app will ask you to confirm and enter your ZIP code. Providing your ZIP allows Alexa to cue up Away Lighting (if you own compatible smart lights) when you’re away from home.

Another great benefit of Alexa Guard is that the feature works alongside home security systems including Ring ADT Pulse and ADT Control.

Learn about great Amazon deals

Did you know that your Echo can key you in on some of the latest Amazon Prime deals? All you need to do is say “Alexa what are your deals?” and your device will read off several Amazon Prime-exclusive deals. You can also use your Echo to select one of these deals purchase the item and track the delivery of the product. When your shipment arrives your Echo indicator light will flash yellow. This is a notification that your item has arrived. To clear notifications just say “Alexa clear my notifications” and the yellow light will vanish.

Customize Alexa answers on Echo and other Blueprints

Alexa now has the ability to customize her answers based on the decisions you make. You can find this option in Alexa skills or right from the redesigned home screen on the app. There is a special “Skill Blueprint” that allows you to build custom answers to specific questions. For example you could create a custom question where you ask “Alexa is Mom always right?” and then create Alexa’s response: “Let me check … Yes all records show that Mom is always right.” You can customize questions in all sorts of ways for jokes or useful information.

If this sounds like the sort of thing you are interested in make sure to check out other Skill Blueprints that can help you track chores count down to important dates and more.

Make a playlist with your voice

You can listen to anything on Amazon Music just by asking Alexa to play it as long as you have an Amazon Prime account. Those with Spotify accounts can sync with their Amazon devices so TuneIn iHeartRadio and Pandora will also play tunes internet radio and podcasts on command. If you bought some MP3s and uploaded them to your Amazon Music Library you can also listen to those.

Whereas previously you had to go to the Amazon Music app to actually create a playlist this is no longer the case. Amazon Music listeners can have Alexa make a playlist simply by saying “Alexa add this to my playlist” or “Alexa create a new playlist.” From here you’ll be able to ask the smart assistant to either add songs to an existing playlist or create a new playlist based on the song that’s currently playing. If you have a Prime Music or Amazon Music Unlimited subscription you can instantly access this feature.

Don’t forget that the Amazon Echo started as a Bluetooth speaker so you can use your Echo device to listen to music or stream to other speakers with better sound.

If you prefer to listen to audiobooks you can do so with your paired Audible account. It’s not quite the same but if you have a list of e-books in your Kindle account you can find which are compatible with Alexa in the app and ask the assistant to read them.

Voice control your TV too

You can connect your Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick to Alexa (if you don’t have a Fire TV Cube with Alexa already built in). When you’ve done all that you’ll be able to ask Alexa not only to turn on the TV but also to search by genre or even actor. So when you say “Alexa show me movies with Brad Pitt” his entire collection should show up. Pro tip: Choose Ocean’s 11 over Ocean’s 12.

Drop In on other Echo devices

Drop In is a feature that allows you to automatically connect and speak through other Echo devices. You can easily find it by going to the Communicate icon on the bottom of the Alexa home screen and then choosing Drop In at the top. This will take you to the settings where you can enable Drop In. Then you can just say “Alexa drop in on” and the name of the Echo or person you want to start talking to.

Drop In only works when both sides enable it so you can’t drop in on a friend without them being aware of the possibility. It’s useful for checking on other areas of a big house or with a family member. If you have several Echos you can also choose to “Drop In on all devices” to use them as an intercom service.

Announce statements to all Echos in the house

Drop In can be useful if you want to have direct conversations with another Echo but if you simply want to make a statement or announcement there is another option right by Drop In called Announce. This will take you to a screen where you can type or dictate a quick message and Alexa will relay it to all the Echos in your group. It’s an ideal way to announce that dinner is ready that bedtime has come or a variety of other family events.

Speak different languages

Your Echo speaker has a feature called Multilingual Mode that allows you to converse with the smart speaker in two different languages. In the U.S. the feature is limited to English and Spanish. In India Multilingual supports Indian English and Hindi. Canadians can use the feature to speak both English and Canadian French. Turning the feature on is as simple as saying “Alexa speak English and Spanish.”

Enjoy Alexa jokes games and Easter eggs

It’s time to have a little fun with Alexa. The virtual assistant has games jokes Easter eggs and amusing answers to all sorts of questions. Let’s not forget the skills available for sports fanatics. With the Fantasy Football skill you can track all your favorite sports teams. You have the ability to ask Alexa for specific information about your weekly fantasy matchups and score updates.

Another useful skill is Find My Phone. This feature helps you find your mobile device should you happen to misplace it. Just say “Alexa find my phone” next time you need help locating your mobile device and Alexa will spring into action.

If you’ve seen other Echos do cool things that yours can’t do simply ask “Alexa do you have any new features?” Alexa will let you know about any recent features that have come out. You can check out the new features with the app too but it’s more fun to have Alexa take care of it for you.

Beyond everything listed above you’ll also want to take a look at our guide to the best Alexa commands — which work flawlessly with your Echo smart speaker or smart display. This will give you even more ways to play your favorite music set up shopping lists or check the weather and news.

Actor Michael Blake Kruse announced that he has checked out of the ABC daytime drama “General Hospital.”

He went on to thank his fans and supporters that have been with him on his daytime journey where he played the role of Rory Cabrera.

“Many thanks to everyone who has sent me supportive messages in light of Rory Cabrera leaving the GH canvas” he said effusively.

Kruse expressed that he enjoyed playing the character and noted that he valued his essence and rightfully so. Rory may have been unsophisticated and naïve but he admired him for being genuine.

Especially with his relationship to Trina Kruse added that Rory was “always sincere” and he had “her best interests at heart.”

The actor conceded that Rory was a mediocre police officer however Port Charles is not the easiest to town to police. Rory was “equipped with a holster from the 70s no radio and no bulletproof vest” he acknowledged.

Kruse shared that being on “General Hospital” afforded him the opportunity to work with “some incredible people” and he has a “newfound respect” for everybody involved in daytime television. “It’s easy to critique but not easy to create” he observed.

“All my love and appreciation to the fans who were supportive along the way” Kruse concluded.

In the original Reddit post the SuperiorWhale blogger said that a new fighting vehicle was spotted by his brother in Michigan where BAE Systems have offices and General Dynamics has a manufacturing plant.

A number of experts claim that this may be a demonstration or test prototype of the next-generation combat vehicle developed by BAE Systems.

A number of visual features of the combat vehicle are also similar to previously published renders.

Damian Ratka a military expert noted that this is a mockup/technology demonstrator of the KF41 Lynx modified for the OMFV program. It was shown at this year’s AUSA annual meeting.

The OMFV is intended to replace the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. It will serve as the Army’s infantry fighting vehicle tasked to maneuver and operate as part of a joint combined arms team for the purpose of creating an advantageous position relative to the enemy to deliver a decisive strike while also controlling maneuver robotics and semi-autonomous systems.

On 25 November 2022 the Comando Logístico (COLOG) / Diretoria de Material of the Brazilian Army announced the selection of the winner of the bid for the service 8×8 armoured combat vehicle defined in Brazil as the Viatura Blindada de Combate de Cavalaria Média Sobre Rodas VBC CAV – MSR 8X8 in short. The choice went for the Centauro II armoured car armed with a 120 mm smoothbore gun produced by the consortium known as CIO the acronym for Consorzio Iveco Oto Melara the two entities being now known as IDV and Leonardo.

The contract signing originally scheduled for December 5th was postponed due to a lawsuit presented by the representative of a group of citizens to the Federal Regional Court of the 1st Region. On December 14th the Supreme Tribunal of Justice rejected that suspension giving therefore the green light to the contract signature which includes the first two systems to be delivered as soon as possible for further trials. Although not announced officially EDR On-Line understood that the contract was signed on December 15th.

One of the key factors that led to the choice of the CIO product is that it is already entering service with the Italian Army first vehicles being tested at the Cavalry School in Lecce the School being also responsible to draft the technical and tactical procedures (TTPs) for the use of the new generation Centauro which leverages the experience acquired with the Centauro  born as a true mobile gun system (MGS) as it was meant to replace M47 tanks deployed in the Italian Army territorial defence brigades during the Cold War era The first Centauro were delivered in the early 1990s the Centauro having seen operational service in many theatres starting from Somalia in 1993 up to recent deployments some being still deployed in Lebanon within the Italian contingent of UNIFIL 2. The Italian Army intent is to replace the Centauro with the Centauro II in seven Cavalry Regiments which will receive 14 vehicles each (with the exception of the unit part of the Parachute Brigade that will receive 10).

The Centauro II can therefore be defined as a MOTS (Military Off-The-Shelf) system and this has certainly been a plus in the Brazilian choice together with the fact that it is armed with a 120 mm gun currently the state of the art in tank gunnery awaiting future developments. Another element that should have favoured the selection of the CIO system is that IDV’s Brazilian branch Iveco do Brazil has an assembly plant in Sete Lagoas that is currently busy in assembling the Guarani 6×6 vehicle. This led the Italian system to beat the other competitor in the short list as the LAV 700 AG proposed by General Dynamics Land Systems of the USA and the ST1-BR proposed by Norinco of China.

According to information acquired by EDR On-Line the Centauro II configuration selected by the Brazilian Army is very similar to the one being delivered to the CIO national customer however they will differ under some key aspects. The add-on armour package will be different no details on the protection level being available while Brazil will not adopt the semi-automatic ammunition loading system installed on Italian Army vehicles. This means that 120 mm ammunition will be handled in the conventional manner as it is done on most western MBTs. Communication systems will include L3Harris RF-7800V VHF radios as well as additional Thales communications systems.

Although numbers are not available the percent of national content included in the contract will be considerable. As usual initial vehicles will be produced in the country of origin which allows speeding up the first deliveries as well as train key Brazilian personnel who will then lead the work in Latin America. The first two Centauro II that must be delivered from the contract signature are nearly ready as these are being taken from the Italian Army production line. Further seven vehicles to be used for operational evaluation should also be produced in Italy while local assembly should start in the following batches. EDR On-Line understood that the chassis should be assembled in Sete Lagoas at the Iveco do Brazil facility while the HITFACT MkII turret designed and produced by Leonardo should be assembled in Rio de Jameiro although the exact production scheme is still under definition. This might put Leonardo in a good position in the bid for the modernisation of part of the Brazilian Army Leopard 1s. Currently the service fields 375 such MBTs among Leopard 1 BEs acquired from the Belgian Army and Leopard 1A5BRs; the latest requirement calls for the modernisation of 52 such MBTs the timeline looking at an initial delivery in 2024 the final tank to be handed over in 2030 when a possible decision for a successor might be taken. Having a common turret between the wheeled MGS and the MBT might reduce the logistic footprint as well as training issues.

Back to the Centauro II which facility will be selected for the final assembly is not know although that of Sete Lagoas looks to the most probable choice. It is to note that the same turret is being proposed by Leonardo for modernising the Leopard 1. IMBEL the Indústria de Material Bélico do Brasil property of the national Ministry of Defence will be in charge of producing 120 mm ammunition in its Fábrica de Juiz de Fora Minas Gerais while AEL Sistemas based in Porto Alegre Rio Grande do Sul part of the Elbit Group is the candidate to be responsible of simulation systems.

As said the first two Centauro II to be delivered to the Brazilian Army are being taken from the Italian production line. 2 Centauro II will in fact remain in Italy. Brazilian personnel will then remain in Italy and will carry out firing trials in Italian ranges and follow closely all acceptance tests carried out by the Italian Army in order to decide how much of the Italian procedure can be considered also for the Brazilian validation process. When this phase will be finished the vehicles will be transferred to the Brazilian Army CAEX (Centro de Avaliações do Exército) in Rio de Janeiro that will conclude the validation process.

According to available information the first 42 vehicles should be delivered to the 1st Mechanised Cavalry Brigade based in Santiago Rio Grande do Sul followed by the 4th Mechanised Cavalry Brigade based in Dourados Mato Grosso do Sul while the last 14 should go to the 1st Jungle Infantry Brigade based in Boa Vista Roraima. The current plan foresees deliveries until 2038 however EDR On-Line understood that the intention is to shorten the timeline 2038 becoming the delivery date for the last vehicle should Brazil decide to increase the uunmber of Centauro II to the original one which was indicated in 221.

No indications of cost were released however knowing the average price of such systems and adding a 20-25% for Integrated Logistic Support an estimate between 600 and 1000 million Euro should be a credible guess.

NEW ALBANY Ind. — A distilled spirits bottling facility in Southern Indiana is getting a $78 million expansion bringing up to 50 new jobs to the area.

Sazerac Northwest Ordinance Distilling is expanding it's New Albany production facility for the third time in three years according to a One Southern Indiana press release.

The former General Mills Pillsbury plant located at 707 Pillsbury Lane was purchased in June of 2018 with a $39.5 million expansion in 2020 that resulted in the addition of 50 full-time employees and a $49 million expansion in 2021 creating the same number of positions.

This new $78 million expansion will include $25 million in building improvements and $53 million in four new processing and bottling lines bringing the total number of lines at the New Albany facility to 14.

The expansion will better allow the company to meet market demand and will result in the addition of up to 50 full-time employees over four years.

James Hartman plant general manager said he's excited the company will create steady good-paying jobs in Floyd County.

“As Sazerac enters its next phase of growth the Northwest Ordinance Distilling processing and bottling plant has the capacity and scalability that make it ideally positioned for investment and job creation to address production growth to meet demand"" Hartman said.

Rochester MN (KROC-AM News) - An arrest warrant has been issued for a Rochester man accused of posting a nude photo of another man without his knowledge or permission

19-year-old Robert Hall is charged with felony counts of dissemination of pornographic works and nonconsensual dissemination of private sexual images. The criminal complaint alleges the posting of the image was prompted by phone conversations with a man being held in the Olmsted County Jail in connection with a variety of crimes including one involving a man who was struck on the head with a machete.

Rochester Police began investigating Hall after a member of the victim's family complained about an internet post featuring a nude photo of the man with a caption saying he was a ""snitch."" Investigators then listened to recordings of the assault suspect's jail calls and discovered that he had spoken to multiple friends ""expressing outrage that the victim is a snitch.""

According to the criminal complaint one of the calls made by 18-year-old Jacob Bale was to Robert Hall during which Hall disclosed that he possessed a photo of the nude victim and Bale instructed him to post it on a social media site. Bale then tells Hall to add the caption about the victim being a snitch and Hall replies that he is logging on to post the image. The phone exchange ends with Hall asking Bale how to spell the word ""snitch.""

Speaking with Business Insider Reuss first discussed hybrids. A lot of people still think they are the best option and a good stepping stone. Automakers like Toyota are still heavily invested in hybrids and continue to prioritize them over fully electric vehicles (of Toyota's 20+ worldwide models only one is all-electric - the bZ4X). Reuss believes they are unnecessary in 2022 and insisted GM has no plans to dilute its investment into electrification with hybrids.

GM's last hybrid the Chevy Volt was discontinued in 2019. However despite Reuss' comments a hybrid version of the C8 Corvette will be unveiled next year. Still it will be sold in limited numbers and GM's commitment towards fully electric vehicles is undoubtedly clear to see.

While manufacturers like Ford divide their ICE and electric divisions Reuss thinks it's best for them to coexist. He noted how different departments should not be segregated and that he wants employees to be able to go back and forth sharing ideas.

Reuss also went over concerns that EVs will overload the grid. He stated that GM is already working to solve this issue and mentioned vehicle-to-vehicle charging and sending unused energy back to the grid during peak hours as possible solutions.

He also addressed charging-industry consolidation. A lot of charging startups have emerged in recent years however now many are merging together. He doesn't think it's a bad thing and believes partnerships are important for delivering adequate charging infrastructure.

Reuss said it was frustrating that buyers are deterred from buying EVs due to the charging experience. Although he admitted it's not perfect he stated that GM's EVs are designed to go as far as its ICE vehicles. Plus the majority of charging is done at home overnight with most EV owners having to rely on public infrastructure only occasionally.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRyaXZpbmdsaW5lLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9oYWxmLXRvbi1oZWF2aWVzLWNoZXZ5LWdtYy0zMC1kdXJhbWF4LWRpZXNlbC12cy02Mi1nYXMtdjgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Half-Ton Heavies: Chevy & GMC 3.0 Duramax Diesel vs 6.2 Gas V8,"Half-Ton Heavies: Chevy & GMC 3.0 Duramax Diesel vs 6.2 Gas V8

December 17 2022

Story By Mike Garrett

For a long time the engine options for a half ton pickup truck or SUV were pretty simple. You might have an inline or V6 engine as a base choice followed by a couple of naturally aspirated V8s in different displacements.

Today it’s a different story. Not only do you still find naturally aspirated six and eight cylinder engines there are a variety of turbocharged engines as well—including Turbodiesels which used to be strictly for heavy duty trucks.

And when it comes to General Motors current high-end half-ton trucks and SUVs buyers have a choice between a 6.2 liter V8 and a 3.0 Duramax I6 turbo diesel.

Whether you are looking at a new Silverado 1500 a Tahoe a Suburban or one of their GMC counterparts—the choice between the 6.2 and the Duramax is one many buyers face. Let’s take a look at the two.

Torque or Horsepower?

Both the 6.2 liter V8 and the 3.0 Duramax serve as upgrades over the more common 5.3 liter V8 and the 6.2 is actually the slightly more expensive option costing about $1500 more than the Duramax.

As you'd expect the choice between the two engines largely comes down to torque horsepower and fuel economy. The 3.0 Duramax comes in at 277 horsepower and 460 pound feet of torque.

The 6.2 V8 meanwhile makes a lot more horsepower - 420 to be exact but with the same 460 pound feet of torque. And both engines come mated to GM's ten-speed automatic transmission.

Real World Performance

So how do these two powerplants compare in the real world? The 6.2 easily beats the Duramax in acceleration thanks to its big horsepower advantage.

But when it comes to towing GM increased the towing capacity of the 3.0 Duramax for 2022 and it now has the same 13300 lb maximum towing capacity as the 6.2 V8.

Where the Duramax gets a significant edge is in fuel economy. Depending on specific trim the 3.0 Duramax can do around 7 miles per gallon better on average than the 6.2.

Keep in mind you'll also want to factor in the difference in price between gasoline and diesel in your area when determining which is more economical to run.

Verdict

Even with its great towing performance and fuel economy the half-ton Duramax still finds itself in a strange spot. Chances are if buyers favor a Diesel engine or have serious towing in mind they’ll probably be looking at a three-quarter-ton HD rig.

And it’s not like the 6.2 V8 is a slouch when it comes to towing. As we just saw there's no real difference between the towing capacity of the two engines. The V8 also runs on regular gasoline of course and is a much simpler design overall.

Ultimately unless a half ton buyer is looking specifically for a the 3.0’s combination of low end torque and improved fuel economy we’d probably recommend going with the more traditional 6.2 V8 in this case.

With that said we are happy the GM (and other brands) offer half-ton turbodiesel options that perform so well. It's great that GM lets buyers choose between horsepower and fuel economy.

And in the end more choice is always a good thing especially in the hyper competitive half-ton pickup truck and SUV segment where buyers have more options than ever.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vZ2lnYXppbmUubmV0L2dzY19uZXdzL2VuLzIwMjIxMjE3LWNvbmNyZXRlLWJhcnJpZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A seemingly simple ``concrete guardrail on the road'' has a sophisticated safety mechanism,"Dec 17 2022 20:00:00

A seemingly simple ``concrete guardrail on the road'' has a sophisticated safety mechanism



by

Concrete vehicle protection fences are installed as medians and car stops on expressways and large roads. Charles McDevitt an engineer at the Federal Highway Administration in the United States said that this protective fence which at first glance looks like a simple concrete block is actually a shape calculated to reduce vehicle accidents as much as possible.The most well-known type of concrete barrier is the. It is named after the fact that the New Jersey State Transportation Authority first used a concrete protective fence as a median strip in 1955.





The jersey barrier has a shallow sloping surface at the bottom which minimizes damage to the sheet metal by allowing the tire to ride on it. Additionally in more severe collisions the bumper hits the upper sloping surface and slides upwards lifting the car. It reduces the friction between the tires and the road surface changes the direction of the vehicle and prevents it from entering the oncoming lane. This is the multi-stage protective effect of the Jersey Barrier.







Another variation of concrete barriers is the 'General Motors (GM)' type which has a lower slope ending higher than the Jersey Barrier. The GM model was effective when large vehicles were in vogue but it soon fell out of use for small vehicles because of the problem that the vehicle body would float excessively and easily overturn.



Contrary to the GM type where the bottom slope ends high there is also a low type. That is the '

F-type barrier '. The name of the F-type barrier is derived from the fact that it was the last of the variations made from A to F for testing.





The F-type barrier performed better than the Jersey barrier in testing but did not become widespread. This is said to be because state transportation authorities were satisfied with the performance of standard Jersey barriers and because the manufacturers who invested heavily in the production of Jersey barriers were reluctant to change the shape. It is



Concrete protective fences with multiple slopes such as the Jersey Barrier have excellent performance but had the disadvantage that performance would be affected if the height of the road surface changed due to paving or construction. Therefore the 'steady slope barrier' with a constant angle was introduced to overcome the problems of complex-shaped protective fences.







The angle of the slope varies slightly from state to state. Tests have shown that the 'Sloped Barrier' has performance close to that of the F-type.



In addition various forms of protective fences have been devised such as a portable protective fence used to protect the safety of road construction workers and a low-profile barrier that suppresses the lifting of the car body by adding a reverse slope. It is used properly according to needs.

Latest Article:

This newsletter outlines some of the surprisingly basic problems with the global financial system. It then examines to what extent the cryptocurrency industry has tried to address some of those problems while mostly missing the mark so far.

The final section focuses on the macroeconomic picture and provides an update on the US economic cycle.

The World’s Savings Problem

Last month I asked a question on Twitter as a thought experiment and discussion starter:

Imagine you live in a developing country with an ongoing severe currency devaluation problem. You want to sell your existing home hold it in some stable liquid value and then probably buy a different home in 2 years. What do you hold it in?

The range of answers was surprising. Many people from developed countries didn’t understand the problem said they would just hold dollars and seemed to wonder why the question was even asked.

The problem of course is that many people in developing countries outside of the upper class have trouble opening foreign bank accounts. Many of them don’t even have domestic bank accounts.

In Egypt for example a country of 100 million people 74% of them don’t have a bank account. In Nigeria it’s 55% in Indonesia it’s 50% and in India it’s 23%.

Those who do have bank accounts often don’t have easy access to foreign currencies at fair exchange rates. And those fortunate enough to have foreign bank accounts often pay rather high fees for that service; it’s not exactly fast or efficient to do business with a foreign bank.

Generally speaking for those that are wealthier there are more avenues available to preserve their savings whereas for people in the working class or middle class the options are fewer and more friction-filled.

Within nations that have ongoing severe currency devaluation problems it’s often either 1) hard to get your hands on dollars or 2) only possible to get them at a worse exchange rate or 3) risky to store them in domestic banks because they could be confiscated and forcibly converted back to the local currency at the direction of the government or central bank.

Some people answered my question by saying they would hold physical cash dollars or gold. Imagine you’re in an apartment in a developing country with a house-value worth of dollars or gold hidden somewhere. Every time you leave the home to work or go somewhere there’s a small part of you that is aware of the possibility of losing your life savings due to a burglar a fire or similar problem.

I received a lot of responses from people in developing countries as well and they were more knowledgeable about the challenges of the question since many of them deal with them on a regular basis. Many of them said they do simply hold large amounts of physical dollars for lack of a safer alternative as risky as that is. Other ones said they would hold cars or other physical assets which is inefficient. Still others said “I just couldn’t ever do this; I can’t sell a home and hold the value in liquid form for any meaningful length of time.”

So here in the year 2022 there are still vast percentages of the global population for which the basic concept of “savings” remains a challenge.

It should be trivial to sell something of significant value and hold that in a liquid and safe form for a couple years until that value is ready to be redeployed.

The fact that it isn’t trivial shows how problematic the global financial system is especially for people in developing countries. Fiat currencies consist of printable/dilutive ledgers each with local monopolies over a given jurisdiction and most of them are managed very poorly or are pushed around by external forces. It’s really bad if you’re not in the top couple dozen jurisdictions in this regard and even still not great even if you are in those top couple dozen jurisdictions.

For example here in the US bank accounts and T-bills have been paying interest rates that are below the prevailing inflation rate pretty much ever since the global financial crisis:

To hold physical cash dollars or even to store those dollars into a liquid bank account or to hold Treasuries is to gradually (or sometimes quickly) be debased. And this is the global reserve currency.

In a country like Nigeria a country of over 200 million people it’s worse. Their aggregate consumer price index has gone up nearly 5x just since 2010 and their interest rates are often below their inflation rate.

My friends and family in Egypt as an example that hits closer to home are dealing with a 35% currency devaluation relative to the dollar this year alone and it’s probably not over yet. This is a currency that over 100 million people use:

For Egyptians that want dollars the street conversion rate is lower than $0.033 as of this writing meaning it takes significantly more Egyptian pounds to get dollars in practice than the official rate implies. Some of them hold physical cash dollars as savings and pay high fees with bad exchange rates in order to do that.

This recent devaluation comes after the fact that the Egyptian pound was already cut in half relative to the dollar practically overnight back in late 2016. I have friends that suddenly had to delay a home purchase back then because the value of their savings was suddenly halved relative to the dollar (and the dollar as the yardstick of measurement here is also losing value each year).

In this chart I zoom out and flip it around to look at how many Egyptian pounds it takes to buy one dollar. The more “bullish” this chart is the worse it is for the Egyptian pound:

There are 180 circulating fiat currencies in the world across nearly 200 countries. Most of these are extremely fragile and prone to recurring major devaluations. It’s hard for people in many developing countries to save liquid value over years.

The World’s Payments Problem

The vast majority of currencies are not salable outside of their local jurisdictions. In other words aside from the fact that they have local monopolies on their use in their local jurisdictions nobody in the rest of the world particularly wants to hold or accept these monies either because they frequently devalue or because they are small with low liquidity and low recognizability outside of their home jurisdiction.

The global monetary system is therefore ironically a big barter system. Rather than having one or two forms of money that we all use there are 180 different monies each with their local monopolies. Only a handful of them such as dollars and euros (and gold more slowly) are globally salable to a decent degree.

For example I have some Egyptian pounds Norwegian kroner Hong Kong dollars and Thai baht in my desk drawer next to me from various trips over the years. Here in suburban New Jersey there’s basically nothing I can do with these. Nobody would accept them including the kroner which is actually a very strong currency. The only way I can get rid of them with some semblance of fair value is to go to a local branch of a major bank chain and see if they’ll initiate a process to take them off my hands in exchange for dollars as part of their foreign exchange service. Some of these currencies might not even be accepted at all at a small bank which makes a holder of these really stuck. These are very unsalable monies.

And then there is the problem of financial censorship. The nonprofit organization Freedom House classifies countries as “Free” or “Partly Free” or “Not Free”. Only 20% of countries meet their definition of “Free” which is down from 46% in 2005. In many countries bank accounts are subject to rather arbitrary freezes and as mentioned above it can be challenging for working class people in developing countries to even access a bank account in many cases because it’s just not worth it for a bank to bother with such small balances. And for millions of people that find themselves as refugees at one point in their life they generally have trouble bringing most or all of their wealth with them.

Many countries increasingly restrict access to physical cash which can seem harmless at first but can have dire consequences if you are in a very unfree country. Governments can shut off bank accounts for individuals they don’t like for any number of reasons.

So there is a lot of work to be done in order to enhance the world’s relationship with money. Storing and transferring liquid value shouldn’t be rocket science in 2022.

Despite the multi-century head start that banks had the percentage of people in the world with a smartphone has already exceeded the percentage of people with a bank account and is rising at a faster rate. There’s no reason why everyone with a smart phone shouldn’t be able to access basic financial services including good money.

Velocity of Money vs Velocity of Commerce

For thousands of years commerce and money moved at the same velocity: the velocity of foot horse and ship.

Peoples’ ability to do transactions and the bearer assets they transacted with (mainly gold and silver) had no inherent difference in terms of velocity. All of it moved at the velocity of physical travel.

Even the invention of banking couldn’t get around this basic problem. The paper banknotes or various receipts for money while easier to transport than gold still couldn’t move faster than foot horse and ship. Ledger-based account systems while convenient still couldn’t send information over long distances any faster than the existing modes of physical travel.

However with the invention of the telegraph and then the telephone the speed of commerce and transactions increased to nearly the speed of light.

Specifically the first working telegraph was invented in the 1830s. Engineers then spent much of the 1840s and 1850s figuring out how to submerge cables under large bodies of water. After a couple failed attempts the first long-lasting transatlantic telegraph cables were put in place in the 1860s and the global banking system quickly became more interconnected in the decades that followed.

From that point people could transact across the world by updating each others’ bank ledgers over telecommunication systems nearly at the speed of light. Meanwhile gold and silver as bearer assets still moved slowly and thus had to be increasingly abstracted in order to keep up.

Prior to this gold and silver were already sometimes abstracted with paper claims due to divisibility limitations or convenience but once telecommunications technology was invented their slow velocity made it absolutely necessary to abstract them in order to deal with the mismatch in velocity between global commerce and global monetary settlement.

Eventually governments dropped gold and silver backing from their bank ledger and physical paper abstractions entirely and that’s how we eventually got to this world of 180 different fiat currencies each with local monopolies and with no viable alternatives. Basically the difference in velocity between commerce and bearer asset money gave governments and banks a huge opportunity for custodial arbitrage.

Throughout the 20th century the global banking system became even more connected and by the 1990s consumer internet commerce began to occur. Over the next few decades until the present this vastly increased the amount of long-distance telecommunications-based payments.

It’s hard to overstate how big of a deal the mismatch in velocity between transactions and bearer asset money has been. It’s arguably a foundational reason for the greater and greater levels of financialization that the world has seen over the past century and a half. Monetary ledgers became increasingly detached from any sort of constraint or scarce units of settlement because the only scarce monetary alternatives such as gold were too slow to present an alternative.

Nakamoto’s Proposal

In 2008 and 2009 an anonymous person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto shared a white paper and then released software that potentially solves this velocity mismatch that has existed since the 1800s.

Nakamoto’s creation the Bitcoin network is a globally distributed public ledger for which the ordering of transactions and the history of the ledger is backed up by energy from millions of different machines around the world (although it is increasingly energy efficient over time).

Its core ruleset is purposely hard to change because it is enforced by tens of thousands of free open-source user-run nodes around the world. These rules include the fact that it has a finite cap of 2.1 quadrillion units (often presented as 21 million units that are each divisible down to eight decimal points). And in order to censor transactions on the network it would require gaining (and maintaining) control over 50% of the network’s active processing power.

The network serves as an open protocol ledger. You can think of it as money in a decentralized cloud with each user controlling a private key that allows them (and only them) to transfer units from their ledger address to someone else’s ledger address domestically and internationally.

By memorizing twelve words that represent your private key or writing them down somewhere or encrypting them in a password-protected file and putting it on some cloud account that you have you could travel with no belongings to another country and reconstruct your ability to access your funds on the ledger after you get there. People who run their own nodes (which can be done on a basic laptop) can send and receive value from others around the world with no ability for any particular entity to prevent those transactions from occurring.

When it was small the network was only marginally useful. The bigger it gets the more it represents something rather interesting- an international accounting ledger and settlement network controlled by no individual entity with a fixed number of its own bearer assets that can be sent around globally at the same speed with which electronic commerce occurs without the need for separate abstraction or counterparties. A person can still use a custodian/counterparty if they wish too for convenience or other reasons.

Prior to this there wasn’t a way to send money from one country to another or even across a country without going through the banking system or using services that themselves run on the banking system. All long-range value transfers (other than stuffing cash in an envelope or something like that) went through banks and central banks which are closed permissioned networks. Now individuals can send value to other individuals over the internet quickly and at scale.

That is the “intrinsic value” of the Bitcoin network- it presents capabilities that bank deposits physical cash and gold can’t do: send permissionless payments globally or maintain access to your self-custodial funds even if you move around the world across borders through airports and such. And in a way that is backed up by more energy and a wider node network than any other cryptocurrency and with a greater amount of liquidity and salability.

A Canadian can pay a Nigerian for some graphic design work and in such a way that goes around either country’s banking system. Vladimir Putin’s political opposition can raise donations even if Vladimir Putin’s government shuts them out of the Russian banking system. Venezuelans can self-custody bitcoin amid hyperinflation and bring them with them if they leave as refugees.

Pandora’s Box has been opened for this capability now- it’s out in the wild. This technology cannot be un-learned. The ability to do this is open-source widely distributed and known now.

Even if a country’s government or central bank severs cryptocurrency exchanges from its banking system therefore adding friction to the network on-ramps this can still be bypassed with peer-to-peer inflows. Nigeria for example is ranked as the 11th country in terms of cryptocurrency adoption despite the fact that people there cannot send money to exchanges from their bank accounts. More Nigerians use bitcoin and stablecoins than use the country’s central bank digital currency the eNaira by a wide margin.

Meanwhile China banned bitcoin mining in 2021 but around 20% of bitcoin’s mining is estimated to still occur in China. This technology is really hard to truly stamp out even by authoritarian governments although many of them will try. We’ll see if the network and its surrounding ecosystem is up to the global challenge or not.

Bull markets lead to leverage and leverage leads to bear markets. But cycle after cycle the value of the network has grinded higher.

Currently the market capitalization (black line above) is beneath the aggregate on-chain cost basis (blue line above) which historically has resulted in 1) the media and pro-cyclical investors referring to the network as being dead and 2) it actually being a pretty good long-term buying opportunity (with careful position sizing).

Should people buy it? Not necessarily. They should learn about it though.

Once someone has learned about it whether it’s worth buying or not will be more clear to them. Learning about it can also give them insights into other areas of the economy because the creation of new technology usually affects other industries over time.

A Period of Exploration

After the invention of the Bitcoin network came a natural period of exploration.

People asked reasonable questions like:

What is the best way to scale this technology?

What if we put dollar tokens on a blockchain?

Can transactions be made even more private?

Can we use this technology for things besides money?

And from those questions came some good things.

Stablecoins have had particular utility. A business/fintech entity can custody dollar-denominated assets in a bank account and issue tokens on a blockchain that represent redeemable claims for a dollar of those assets. These tokens are bearer assets that can be transferred around globally. Over time stablecoin issuers have become better at making their collateral more transparent although I think there is still work to be done to further improve collateral transparency and assurances.

One of the most popular answers to my question of where should someone in a country with a severe currency devaluation problem hold substantial value for two years was stablecoins. A lot of people said they would hold it in dollar stablecoins which comes with foreign counterparty risk from their perspective but presents a rather new and powerful method for them.

The reason stablecoins are useful is because they solve at least some of the currency problems for people in developing countries over the intermediate term. Suppose you’re an Argentinian dealing with ever-devaluating peso. You don’t particularly trust holding dollars in an Argentinian bank because there has been a history of confiscation of those dollars there. So a lot of Argentinians have turned to stablecoins- they can self-custody stablecoins in any number of free software wallets (or use a foreign exchange custodian as many of them do) and although stablecoins have a centralized issuer that issuer is not in Argentina and can’t be controlled by Argentina. For the most part stablecoin issuers can only be controlled by the US since they rely on banks that connect to the US financial system.

For that reason stablecoins have found significant utility by the public in multiple countries that suffer from ongoing currency problems along with bitcoins.

On Chainalysis’ crypto adoption index 18 out of the 20 top countries are developing countries. A lot of people in the developed world think of this technology as a solution in search of a problem but people in developing countries tend to be more familiar with the problem that these solutions are for.

A Decade of Affinity Scams and Grift

Over the past decade alongside the utilitarian developers of this technology a rather negative industry has popped up: pump-and-dump schemes hype cycles altcoin casinos and leverage. A lot of it is disguised as technical development.

When you read Satoshi’s writings he was about as plain-spoken as possible. He was anything but hype. He wrote carefully about the problems he wanted to solve- namely currency dilution and transaction censorship. When he answered questions or explained his reasoning he often sounded like a professor. His white paper reads like an academic study. He wanted to make decentralized peer-to-peer money with no central issuer that can debase it and no central entity who can censor it.

When Wikileaks turned to using it after they were de-platformed by major payment services rather than being happy about this development Satoshi was concerned that it was too early for the fledgling network at the time and that it would bring too much negative attention.

Satoshi never gave himself coins as a reward for his invention. All coins including his had to be mined with computing power. An entity that is believed to be him (referred to by the community as “Patoshi”) mined in the first two years to keep the network functioning and gradually tapered down purposely slowing his own mining as more miners spun up.

Source: Jameson Lopp via Twitter

Satoshi then eventually disappeared with no fanfare and the “Patoshi” coins that are believed to belong to him haven’t moved in 13 years through wild bull and bear markets alike.

Many of the industry participants that followed in his wake have been anything but that. They create new coins out of thin air purporting to decentralize some new application get those coins listed on an exchange hype them up and then dump them on the retail public without having built an actual sustainable project. The founders and early investors get rich the project doesn’t really go anywhere and retail investors are left holding the bag.

Back in May I wrote “Digital Alchemy” which explored several negative aspects of the industry.

I then catalogued a lot of the false claims and problematic industry practices in my latest public article: “The Problems with DeFi and Crypto“ especially in the section about arbitrary seigniorage:

The Problem of Arbitrary Seigniorage When founders and early venture capitalists put together a tech startup they generally tie their fortunes to the success or failure of that idea. They invest in rather illiquid equity and the main way to unlock that equity and get successful exit liquidity involves either going public or being acquired. To go public they have to go through an expensive disclosures process where they open up their books reveal the major ownership and discuss risks in detail. The median length of time for a startup to go public from its founding is over eight years. To be acquired they need to build something attractive enough for another business to want to buy them out. In other words professionals with MBAs or other business experience/education review their business and decide to buy it. Therefore the fortunes of the founders and early investors of the startup are usually tied in a significant way to the underlying fundamentals of the business that they built and financed. The company needs some revenue some use-case and to go through some degree of due diligence. They have to spend years building a company that either another company wants to buy or that gets big enough and sticks around long enough to go public with all of the necessary disclosures. In the crypto world it has been different. Founders and early investors can create a project sell the coins publicly (generally to accredited investors or overseas to avoid public securities laws now ever since there was a crackdown in domestic public initial coin offerings) work on it for a year or two or three market it heavily get it listed on a crypto exchange and then dump the hyped-up coins (which likely are unregistered securities) on public retail speculators with exaggerated or outright false claims about the project’s level of decentralization and utility. In other words the founders and early investors can separate their own profits from the actual success of the project’s fundamentals. They don’t need to spend the better part of a decade building a business that is good enough for another business to want to acquire it or that can go through the SEC’s process for entering public markets. They can just create hype and dump their coins on the retail public for the sake of fast exit liquidity. “Seigniorage” is the profit that a government makes by issuing its own currency especially as it relates to the difference between production cost (near zero) and its market value. Blockchain technology has enabled private entities to benefit from seigniorage as well. They can create a crypto semi-liquid/fungible asset for very little cost hype it up and try to profit from it. Because very little value is being created in the process it’s mostly a zero sum game where the creators and promoters of the coins make the money and retail speculators lose the money. Bitcoin doesn’t meet the definition of a security because it never raised capital. Instead the open source software was created and then just put out there. Based on on-chain analysis it’s pretty clear that Satoshi Nakamoto didn’t sell his coins either; he walked away from the network back in 2010 without any clear financial benefit and the network has continued without him in a rather decentralized way. However the technology that Satoshi Nakamoto created to enable peer-to-peer payments and savings has also been repurposed by others for peer-to-peer scams frauds and what is basically digital penny stock pumping-and-dumping in the broader cryptocurrency industry. As this keeps happening I think one of two things will happen. For one regulators in more countries may clamp down on this practice even more than they already have. The US has already limited the ability to sell unregistered initial coin offerings to the onshore public and they may further limit the ability of onshore exchanges to sell them to the public post-offering as well. Secondly regardless of whether that regulatory risk materializes or not people will be burned by the crypto industry over and over until they start associating cryptocurrencies with scams. This has already occurred to some degree and it’s a mostly accurate heuristic. “Does it Need a Token?” The problem with the crypto industry has nothing to do with cryptography. Nobody would blame any developers for researching interesting technologies and building interesting projects. The ethical problems only arise if they try to make millions of dollars from that work prior to the fundamental success of that work. When evaluating any cryptocurrency or adjacent project if it has its own coin or token always ask “does it really need a token?” Usually the answer is no. And the reason why it has a token anyway is to benefit the creators/founders in terms of fast exit liquidity regardless of whether the underlying project offers any real value in the long run. As an example suppose someone invents a ride-sharing app called Rebu except this one is branded as a “Web3” project that is “decentralized”. The founding team and early investors create their own Rebu coins give themselves most of it and sell some to raise capital. They spend two years working on the app and hyping it up and get Rebu coins listed on some crypto exchanges a lot of retail speculators buy the coins (which are likely unregistered securities despite being sold to the public now) and the Rebu developers and early investors use that opportunity to exit their Rebu coin positions with huge multi-million dollar gains. And then people realize “Wait wouldn’t it be easier to buy Rebu rides with dollars rather than having to convert dollars to Rebu coins first? Doesn’t this just add unnecessary friction?” And then of course the project goes nowhere and eventually falls apart Rebu coins collapse in value but the developers and early investors already exited and got rich. Web3 is an industry marketing term for a subset of cryptocurrencies to try to offer a more decentralized internet experience than the Web2 that we’ve become accustomed to with its large and centralized social media companies (Facebook Youtube Twitter and so forth). While the goal is admirable the problem is that of course most of these projects want to issue their own token most of them are not really decentralized and most of them will fail (although many of the creators will get rich anyway thanks to fast exit liquidity).

Swan.com did some market research this year and found that out of the 20000+ crypto assets only three of them have ever managed to reach a higher-high in bitcoin-denominated terms in their second growth cycle compared to their initial hype cycle.

Back to Basics

As most of the crypto industry blows up from speculation and leverage it’s a good time for researchers developers institutions and investors to go back to basics and focus on the actual utility of this technology: storing and transmitting value globally as seamlessly and as permissionlessly as possible.

Most of my investments and research are focused on public equities. But for private investments I put some time and capital to work in venture opportunities to scale and improve the Bitcoin ecosystem with a 7-10 year growth timeframe. It’s not something I view as an asset to trade- it’s a network and surrounding ecosystem that I see great opportunity in and to keep improving. It’s not without risks however.

I’m also interested in technologies and solutions that make dollars or gold more digitally accessible to anyone with a smartphone globally. These solutions have counterparty risks and are not perfect but they serve a useful intermediate role.

Billions of people in the world to varying degrees have problems with storing and transmitting value as shocking as that is here in 2022. In my opinion that’s the signal to focus on once you look through all of the offshore leveraged crypto casino noise.

Portfolio Updates

I have several investment accounts and I provide updates on my asset allocation and investment selections for some of the portfolios in each newsletter issue every six weeks.

These portfolios include the model portfolio account specifically for this newsletter and my relatively passive indexed retirement account. Members of my premium research service also have access to three additional model portfolios and my other holdings with more frequent updates.

I use a free account at Personal Capital to easily keep track of all my accounts and monitor my net worth.

M1 Finance Newsletter Portfolio

I started this account in September 2018 with $10k of new capital and I put new money in regularly. Currently I put in $1000 per month.

It’s one of my smallest accounts but the goal is for the portfolio to be accessible and to show newsletter readers my best representation of where I think value is in the market. It’s a low-turnover multi-asset globally diversified portfolio that focuses on liquid investments and is scalable to virtually any size.

I chose M1 Finance because their platform is commission-free and allows for a combo of ETF and individual stock selection with automatic and/or manual rebalancing. It makes for a great model portfolio with high flexibility and it’s the investment platform I recommend to most people. (See my disclosure policy here regarding my affiliation with M1.)

And here’s the breakdown of the holdings in those slices:

Changes since the previous issue:

Consolidating the growth stock section towards fewer higher-quality names.

Bitcoin Note:

I use small allocations to bitcoin price proxies such as MSTR and GBTC in some of my portfolios for lack of better alternatives in a brokerage environment but compared to those types of securities the real thing is better.

To any extent that is possible I recommend holding actual bitcoin for those that want exposure to it and learning how to self-custody it. I buy mine through Swan.com.

Other Model Portfolios and Accounts

I have three other real-money model portfolios that I share within my premium research service including:

Fortress Income Portfolio

ETF-Only Portfolio

No Limits Portfolio

Plus I have larger personal accounts at Fidelity and Schwab and I share those within the service as well.

Final Thoughts: The Economic Cycle

The US economy continues to point towards economic deceleration with a real possibility of a recession in 2023.

The interest rate spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the 3-month Treasury bill is inverted which was a precursor to the past eight recessions stretching back to the 1960s with no misses or false-positives so far. This chart stretches back to the 1980s:

The ISM manufacturing purchasing manager’s index has rolled below 50 which will become indicative of a recession if it doesn’t start turning up soon:

Chart Source: YCharts

The Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world have focused on restraining demand and economic growth in order to quell inflation. And for a time that is working. We’re in a disinflationary cycle in what could easily turn out to be a period of structural inflation.

When we look back at prior periods of structural inflation such as the 1940s or the 1970s inflation tended to come in several waves:

This is because governments and central banks don’t just sit back and do nothing. They attempt periods of monetary tightening or they attempt price and wage controls in order to suppress prices. Those policies work for a time until they don’t.

The 1940s inflation was very much fiscal-driven and ended when governments went back to a period of fiscal austerity. The 1970s inflation was very much loan-driven and oil-shock driven and ended partially when monetary policy was tightened but also because the oil supply shock ended and domestic wages were pressured by offshoring. Here in the 2020s fiscal deficits are still large and the energy supply situation remains structurally unresolved.

When people say they want lower inflation what they really want is disinflationary growth. They want the supply side to get more developed and more efficient so that they can get more of the things they want.

Only through improving the supply side can the global economy enjoy another good cycle of disinflationary growth. Otherwise the global economy will get either 1) inflationary growth via currency devaluation or 2) disinflationary stagnation or recession via demand suppression or even 3) a stagflationary situation with a combination of weak growth and sticky inflation.

My base case unless or until I see evidence to the contrary is for worsening economic conditions in the first half of 2023 continuing the trend of disinflation via demand suppression. US corporate profit margins are likely to go sideways or down and economic activity is likely to be sluggish and potentially recessionary.

Looking out to 2024 or 2025 is where I see potential for the next growth wave and since the supply side constraints (especially for energy production and distribution) haven’t been solved another wave of inflation could easily come with it.

To skip our analysis of the recent market trends and activity you can go directly to see the 5 Best Shipping Stocks That Pay Dividends.

The global shipping industry provides maritime passenger or freight services and is one of the most important modes of transportation in international logistics. Over 90% of world trade is carried by the international shipping industry and companies involved in the sector are responsible for the transportation of raw materials commodities and finished goods across the oceans through various vessels. While the global shipping supply chain has suffered through a crisis since the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 the global economy now faces the exact opposite problem: too many containers. Although liner companies have desperately tried to cut services and blanked sailings it has not been enough to prevent spot freight rates from returning to ‘normal’ levels. Faced with uncertainty ship owners have delayed some new building orders and the average age of the world container ship fleet has risen from 10.3 to 13.7 years. After over two years of rising rates and overstretched capacity the rapidly cooling shipping market seems to be set for an uncertain 2023.

According to a DHL Global Forwarding report shipping container lines racked up profits of $40 billion from Q2 2020 to Q2 2022 and there has been significant progress in the clearing of port congestions which has led to a significant reduction in spot container freight rates. According to the S&P Global Market Intelligence the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is expected to fall about 20% to 30% to average about 1300-1400 points in 2023 before recovering to average about 1400-1500 points in 2024. However changes in mainland China's 'zero-COVID' policy or ceasefire agreements in the Russia-Ukraine war would continue to pose major upside catalyst while a faster-declining container market with global recession remains as a major downside risk in the medium and long-term. Overall dry bulk freight rates are expected to return to the pre-pandemic level in the coming months. Additionally a limited supply growth driven by regulation and lack of new building order will help the market in its recovery during the second half of 2023 and 2024.

Shipping stocks have a history of paying a significant portion of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends. In times of good profitability for shipping and container companies they have some of the highest dividend yields. To this end we have compiled a list of 10 shipping stocks that investors can take advantage of including stocks like Global Ship Lease Inc. (NYSE:GSL) Scorpio Tankers Inc. (NYSE:STNG) and Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE:GNK) among others listed below.

Purse breakdown for teams and players in Qatar,"As well as silverware and pride there has been plenty of prize money on the line at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. And with their victory in the final over France Argentina have just made themselves much richer!

While the focus for most teams was on lifting the iconic trophy and representing their nations well there is definitely a tangible benefit for success on the pitch on the biggest stage.

The prize money can be especially beneficial for smaller nations to help improve their infrastructure and development pathways back home to improve for future editions of the tournament.

FIFA haven't held back when it comes to prize money for World Cups in recent years and 2022 is no different — with record-breaking sums up for grabs.

Here The Sporting News breaks down the prize money on offer in Qatar and how much each team has won.

Total prize money at the 2022 World Cup

FIFA allocated $440 million in prize money for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

That was an increase of $40m compared to the 2018 tournament and just $358m in prize money was on offer at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

Though a very significant sum FIFA had a revenue budget of $4.6 billion in 2022 with broadcasting rights contributing $2.6 billion alone in income.

How much prize money will 2022 World Cup winners Argentina get?

FIFA confirmed in April 2022 that the Qatar World Cup champions were to receive a record $42 million in prize money.

That is an increase of $4m compared to 2018 and continues a trend that has seen the winners' pay packets increase massively over the past 40 years.

Prior to 2006 World Cup-winning teams never pocketed more than $10m with 1982 champions Italy walking away with an estimated $2.2m for their efforts.

In 2002 there was a big push from national teams for FIFA to increase the prize money on offer with growing World Cup revenue ensuring such profits have been handed down to successful sides since.

Year Prize money

(USD) 2022 $42m 2018 $38m 2014 $35m 2010 $30m 2006 $20m 2002 $8m 1998 $6m 1994 $4m 1990 $3.5m 1986 $2.8m 1982 $2.2m

World Cup 2022 prize money breakdown: How much has each team made?

With so much prize money on offer every side will walk away from Qatar significantly richer.

Simply qualifying for the 2022 World Cup saw each team paid a $1.5 million participation fee. But once at the tournament sides were able to make much larger sums by progressing through the knockout stages.

Based on the the prize money breakdown revealed by FIFA reaching the semifinals in Qatar saw teams earn more than the 2006 World Cup winners received.

2022 Finish Prize money (USD) Group stage $9m Round of 16 $13m Quarterfinals $17m Fourth place $25m Third place $27m Runner-up $30m Winner $42m

How much money do players make at the World Cup?

As the key part of any successful team players also benefit financially from featuring at a World Cup.

While base salaries differ between national teams and for different players they do get a share of whatever prize money their team walks away with.

FIFA allows each team to decide what share players receive and Germany promised to give each of their players a near $400000 bonus had they lifted the title on home soil in 2006.

In 2022 it's been reported that Australia paid each of its players AU$226000 with an extra $290000 to be paid for reaching the knockout stages.

Other nations are likely to have offered a bit more or less than this amount to their players depending on each federation's financial situation.

How does World Cup 2022 prize money compare to the 2023 Women's World Cup?

FIFA have previously announced that $60 million in total prize money will be up for grabs at the 2023 Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.

While more than seven times less than what was offered at Qatar 2022 it is double the estimated $30m that was provided to women's teams at the 2019 tournament.

That World Cup offering was itself a doubling of the $15m that was apparently contributed by FIFA at the 2015 Women's World Cup in Canada.

The ABC reported in July that FIFA could further increase the prize money on offer at the 2023 Women's World Cup with a figure of $100m mentioned.

In May the United States men's and women's teams agreed that they would share the combined prize money they each won at the 2022 and 2023 World Cups.

""This is a truly historic moment. These agreements have changed the game forever here in the United States and have the potential to change the game around the world"" US Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone said at the time.

""US Soccer and the USWNT and USMNT players have reset their relationship with these new agreements and are leading us forward to an incredibly exciting new phase of mutual growth and collaboration as we continue our mission to become the preeminent sport in the United States."""

The ball sold for the $1.5 million amount Saturday night after months of auctioning by Goldin. Action Network’s Darren Rovell spoke with Youmans who said he wasn’t comfortable with a private sale — There were offers up to $3 million before he let Goldin handle the auctioning.

“While a private sale is certainly appealing and there’s nothing wrong with $3 million people may not appreciate that this is not Hal Steinbrenner calling and say ‘Hey I’ll write you a check for $3 million or Aaron Judge saying ‘I’ll write you a check” Youmans said. “This comes through art dealers and law firms and there’s not a lot of transparency. And I have concerns about selling the ball that way.”

The Rangers were a part of this history though on the unfortunate side. But Judge’s ball was sold and the Rangers can look toward a 2023 season with optimism after a major pitching overhaul that included the additions of Jacob deGrom and Andrew Heaney.

Aaron Judge's American League-record-breaking 62nd home run ball sold for $1.5 million with a buyer's premium on Saturday night via collectibles marketplace Goldin.

While the buyer has chosen to remain anonymous he said in a statement issued through Goldin the he is ""lucky blessed ... to own a piece of baseball and American history.""

Seller Cory Youmans caught the ball at Globe Life Field in Arlington Texas during an Oct. 4 game between the New York Yankees and Texas Rangers. He turned down a $3 million offer for the ball and elected to put it up for auction.

Some believed the famed ball would challenge the record paid for a baseball but it fell short of the $3.05 million paid for Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball in 1998 by comic book artist Todd McFarlane. Still Judge's home run ball is the second-most-expensive baseball ever sold at auction.

""Multiple players have hit more home runs in a season but in many people's eyes Aaron Judge is the true record-holder"" Ken Goldin the executive chairman and founder of Goldin told ESPN. ""The fact that this is the second-highest total ever paid for a baseball speaks to the respect that fans and collectors have for Aaron. That's the magic of sports -- this ball didn't only change Aaron's life it changed the life of the fan who was in the stadium that night too. We're so proud to have been trusted by Cory to present this piece of history for public auction.""

Judge's home run ball was displayed at the J.P. Morgan Club in Madison Square Garden on Dec. 7 the same day Judge signed a nine-year $360 million deal to remain with the Yankees. The contract made Judge the most expensive position player in MLB history with a $40 million average annual value.

Youmans a vice president at Fisher Investments previously told ESPN that he hoped the ball would end up with either Judge the Yankees or in Cooperstown -- but that the auction would ultimately decide that.

Judge said in November prior to signing his massive contract that he did not plan to bid on the ball.

""I haven't signed my free agent deal yet"" Judge said at the time. ""So I think that's a little out of my price range right now.""

According to sources acquainted with the situation top management has reportedly urged managers to identify problematic employees for future layoffs according to Semafor. The layoffs which are expected to start early in 2019 and could affect up to 8% of Goldman's workforce of more than 49000 workers are currently planned to take place.According to a source familiar with the bank's thinking the bank still needs to make decisions regarding the extent of the anticipated job layoffs. The bank's headcount will remain larger after the releases than before the COVID-19 pandemic.Employees at Goldman are jittery about the annual performance evaluation process this year as they prepare for possible layoffs.At the time a Goldman source informed the media that everyone was waiting impatiently and was concerned. Goldman Sachs opted not to respond.The bank is considering several cost-cutting measures including layoffs. According to The Financial Times Goldman may reduce investment bankers' compensation by 40% this year the most significant reduction since the Great Recession. Bloomberg stated earlier this week that Goldman was preparing to make at least 400 cutbacks to its underperforming retail banking segment.David Solomon the CEO of Goldman Sachs recently pointed to the challenging global economic conditions expected in 2023 and indicated the bank would aim to reduce its costs with a reduction in the workforce among the anticipated measures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlb3BsZW1hdHRlcnMuaW4vbmV3cy9zdHJhdGVnaWMtaHIvcmVjZXNzaW9uLXdlYXJ5LWdvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtZmluYWxpc2luZy1wbGFuLXRvLXNhY2stNDAwMC1zdGFmZi1uZXh0LXllYXItMzYzODfSAX5odHRwczovL3d3dy5wZW9wbGVtYXR0ZXJzLmluL2FtcC1zdHJhdGVnaWMtaHItcmVjZXNzaW9uLXdlYXJ5LWdvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtZmluYWxpc2luZy1wbGFuLXRvLXNhY2stNDAwMC1zdGFmZi1uZXh0LXllYXItMzYzODc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recession-weary Goldman Sachs finalising plan to sack 4000 staff next year,"The bank targets culling “up to 8 per cent” of its 49000 global workforce in January next year.

Recession-weary Goldman Sachs is drawing up a layoff plan which may see as many as 3900 employees pack their bags and go starting in January.

This is likely to send out an indication of what the job market will be in the next year. It is believed that the drastic move is precipitated by stiff competition from Morgan Stanley.

Media reports quoted Chief Executive David Solomon who hinted at taking such a drastic step to reduce headcount. Solomon said he urgently seeks to scale up the bank's profitability amid economic headwinds.

The plans are being finalised and it is possible that the current target for a cull of “up to 8 per cent” of its 49000 global workforce will be slimmed down if the business outlook improves according to three people familiar with the discussions.

Wall Street is staring at an uncertain future. Investment banking fees have tumbled 35 per cent in the year to date according to Refinitiv data.

Reports suggested that pressure is mounting on Goldman to ramp up margins because Solomon is trying to improve the bank’s stock market valuation.

It has lagged behind peers such as Morgan Stanley for years.

In October the bank announced a merger of the investment banking and trading division as well as a pullback from consumer banking following investor criticism of its losses and escalating costs.

Solomon hinted at the coming cuts at the bank’s financial services conference last week. “We continue to see headwinds on our expense lines particularly in the near term” he said.

He further said the bank has set in motion certain expense mitigation plans but it will take some time to realise the benefits."
HAL,Halliburton,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ibG9nLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzE4L2ZvcmQtZml4aW5nLXF1YWxpdHktbW9zdC1pbXBvcnRhbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford CEO Farley tells retired engineers fixing quality will 'take several years',"After a number of years of recalls troubling warranty costs Ford hired former J.D. Power VP Josh Halliburton in March of this year to be executive director of quality. In November Halliburton got a new boss Ford moving longtime product development exec Jim Baumbick into the role of chief transformation and quality officer to replace Stuart Rowley. Having just called the audible it's going to take Ford time to execute the play. Ford Authority reports that when CEO Jim Farley recently spoke to the Ford Retired Engineering Executives (FREE) group he told them ""Fixing quality is my No. 1 priority ... It is the most important initiative in the whole company. And it’s going to take several years.""

Farley's already been on the mission for a couple of years and things aren't much better now than when he officially became Ford's CEO on October 1 2020. One of the pillars of his company strategy was improving quality. According to Detroit Free Press figures Ford Motor Company spent $3.923 billion in warranty costs in 2020 for 4.19 million cars sold globally nearly $2 billion more than GM in a year where auto factories had to shut down for two months. Consumer Reports' Annual Reliability Study rated the Ford brand 22nd out of 26 automakers in 2020 Lincoln pulling up in the caboose at 26th. In 2021 things got worse Ford spending $3.952 billion on warranty claims for 3.94 million cars sold — and those two years were massive improvements over 2018 and 2019. Ford did climb two spots in CR's reliability survey Lincoln remained last. This year's a bit mixed Lincoln reaching 10th place on the CR survey Ford at 18th the same place it held in 2021 and both brands moving up slightly in CR's Brand Report. However Ford has had 46 recalls covering 6.8 million vehicles through the first seven months of this year more than triple the next brand Tesla nearly five times GM in third. And CR rates bread-and-butter models like the Explorer and F-150 below average for reliability so too the in-demand Mustang Mach-E and says ""All other Fords are average.""

As Farley told the engineers ""We didn’t lose [quality] in just one or two years"" and as everyone who's been sick knows getting back to health almost always takes longer than getting sick. In comments about the issue to other audiences reportage has always mentioned Farley's connecting the warranty issues to customer unhappiness and Ford's bottom line. This time it was apparently all about Job One. ""Until we fix quality"" he told the engineers ""nothing else matters.""

EAST HARTFORD Conn. — The East Hartford community is stepping up to help a neighbor after a ""Grinch"" appeared to have stolen a food donation bin from an elaborate Christmas decoration display.

The ""Santa's Village"" display on Oak Street is home to a front lawn full of inflatable decorations for the holidays. Rick Bollash runs the display and encourages visitors to bring donations to benefit St. Mary's East Hartford food pantry in return. This is his third year decorating the home for the holiday season.

""I started it after I had open heart surgery"" he said. ""Last year we collected probably about seven trunks full of food for them.""

Bollash shared photos to social media Thursday of where the donation bin previously stood when it and the donations inside vanished. A rectangle patch of grass in the middle of the snow-covered yard and a damaged bin lid was all that was left.

""When I left to go to work it was gone. Just a broken lid and a bunch of dry ground"" Bollash said. ""I guess they needed it.""

Bollash said donations have been slow because the economy has impacted people's ability to give. Calls for more donations were made Friday by Mayor Mike Walsh.

""People from all over come to see the display and all Mr. Bollash asks for in return are non-perishable food items or monetary donations to benefit the East Hartford Food Bank"" Walsh said and added ""Can you help us save Christmas?""

The community came through. Bollash's front porch had donations of food and paper goods piled up on his front door and he shared the good news Saturday morning.

""I had to walk around to the back door because the front steps were all full of food"" he said. ""I’ve just been trying to find space anywhere I can.""

While FOX61 was at the home Saturday a woman came by to drop off canned goods another man stopped by to share his desire to donate bread from his bakery and Hank Stephenson brought a box full of items.

""I felt like if someone felt the need to take it they must have needed it as well so there are a lot of people in need. I’m in a position where I can help out a little bit so why not celebrate the holiday spirit by giving back"" he said. ""What better way to give back to the community and give to those in need.""

Stephenson always walks by the home. Cars drove by the display and gave a 'honk' as a sign of appreciation.

Bollash has also raised $1000 to give to the food pantry. He said cars will line up to drop off donations. He's even had people from out-of-state reach out since it happened to share they donated to their local food pantry because of him. Bollash said what's happened has made people more aware of the life many live.

""If people can find it to give or if they’re able to give fine. If you can’t give do whatever you can"" he said. ""If we can do this and bring a little joy to everybody bring a little Christmas spirit back and see if we can get a community's giving thing going.""

Mr. and Mrs. Claus are stopping by the home Tuesday from 7-9 p.m. Bollash is encouraging people to stop by for a walk around his Christmas setup and donate if they can.

(Wizards of the Coast image)

After stints with Microsoft’s Xbox team and Amazon’s finance and fulfillment departments Cynthia Williams started a new role 10 months ago as president at Wizards of the Coast.

Williams has presided over a period of significant growth and visibility for both of the company’s two major brands. Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering have seen their audiences expand dramatically over the course of the last few years to the point where Wizards’ parent company Hasbro reorganized last year to put more focus on Wizards’ output.

In Washington state Wizards of the Coast employs about 800 people in offices in Renton and Bellevue. It currently maintains a hybrid workplace policy where many employees are full-time remote while others come into the office for necessary collaborative and creative work.

We spoke with Williams to discuss Wizards’ year to date a recent social media controversy diversity and the company’s ongoing expansion into developing video games in-house among other topics. The interview was edited for clarity.

GeekWire: At the start of the year we were talking about how 2021 2020 and 2019 had been record-setting revenue years for Wizards of the Coast. How did 2022 wind up going?

Cynthia Williams: We are on pace for Magic: The Gathering to be Hasbro’s first brand to hit $1 billion dollars in the fiscal year. We’ve had a record-breaking year … the five tentpole releases for Magic [the main sets Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty Streets of New Capenna and Dominaria United; the Commander set Battle for Baldur’s Gate; and the compilation set Double Masters 2022] have all hit $100 million dollars.

Of course the acquisition of D&D Beyond [the game’s most popular digital toolset] has been a real aperture opening for our ability to see what our fans are doing in the world of Dungeons & Dragons every day whether they’re playing at home or not. We’ve seen that registered user base grow more than 20%.

We are once again having a phenomenal year.

Key art from the Magic set Dominaria United. (Wizards of the Coast Image)

So you’re getting a better idea of how people use D&D Beyond now that it’s in-house?

Exactly. The access to see the characters they’re creating and what they’re doing is giving us more data on a digital basis versus doing surveys which is how we’ve learned more about our players through the years on the analog side.

It reminds me of how the achievement system on Xbox has been such a big deal for gathering player data. Speaking of which as a former Xbox employee what do you feel like you brought from that to your new job at Wizards?

Going to my first E3 in 2019 was when I really understood what it means to have fans. The Xbox fans were so passionate.

That was the year that Keanu Reeves was on stage. It was such a phenomenal moment and I truly began to understand the passion that people can have for their play system or their brand or their game in a different way.

When I started talking to Chris Cocks [Hasbro CEO and the former Wizards president] about joining Wizards of the Coast I knew that the fanbases for Magic and D&D are even more fanatical than Xbox or PlayStation fans. That’s really what I brought was the understanding of the stewardship that you have for these brands that are part of people’s lifestyles and identities.

What is Wizards’ strategy going into 2023?

Since I got here it has very much been about inviting more people to the party and making sure that they found a space where they could express who they are.

Our games teach that diversity is a strength. D&D in particular will teach you that together you can overcome tasks challenges or an adventure that you wouldn’t have been able to on your own.

When you’re playing Magic you’re seeing the diversity of the world in the characters. You see yourself.

I love the stories of people playing Dungeons & Dragons and being able to express who they are in that game which leads them to being able to express who they are in their real life. We’re very much cultivating that level of diversity as we’re inviting players in.

We’re excited in 2023 about several things. Certainly there’s the movie Honor Among Thieves. I’ve seen it twice now. It’s funny. It’s going to introduce a whole new group of people to the game and let them come into this world and learn all the benefits of it.

Chris Pine [Honor Among Thieves‘ male lead] on the Comic-Con stage made a point that’s near and dear to our hearts which is that every high school should have a D&D program. When you’re around the table playing together differences evaporate and everyone is having fun. I love that he is spreading that gospel to the world.

On the Magic side we’re going to continue the 30th anniversary with the continuation of the Phyrexia story. Then in the summer we have our massive Universes Beyond set for Lord of the Rings.

What we’ve seen with our Universes Beyond sets is that the crossover collaborations are leading new people to Magic. With Warhammer 40K those sets have just been evaporating off shelves. We are on our third reprint of the sets because people just can’t get enough of it.

As we talk to store owners they’re telling us that they’re getting new customers coming into their stores looking for WH40K. We love that. We love this opportunity to give fans of another IP an expression of what they love and introduce them to the world of Magic.

What do you see as the trends in the tabletop industry going forward into next year?

The big trend that we’re seeing is the importance of having both a digital and a physical expression of things. We call those “hybrid players” people who play both.

That’s another lesson I took from Xbox that I’m carrying with me: when you give people more ways to play when you meet them where they are they play more.

We’re seeing that after we acquired D&D Beyond and having both the TCG Magic and [the online version of Magic] Arena. Those hybrid players are the most satisfied with the game they play the most and as a result they spend more.

We see the importance of continuing to develop the ecosystem to have both the physical and digital expression as one of the key trends for tabletop going forward.

What’s your position on the recent accusation that the heightened rate of Magic releases has been flooding the zone so to speak? It does seem that there’s been so much more Magic coming out this year than any year previously.

From my vantage point there are two things. Number one for the last three years we’ve done six tentpole sets [per year]. It’s not that there are more big releases.

What is true is that for the past six years we’ve been learning more about our player base. Part of what we’ve learned is that within Magic you’ve got about 80% of the population that considers themselves a more casual player.

That insight led to the introduction of the Commander decks [a casual multiplayer format for Magic]. What we’ve learned about the people who love to be collectors has led to the collectors’ booster sets.

When we talk about there being “too much Magic” one piece of it is that for the same number of releases we’ve added more SKUs. Not that we expect someone to buy all the SKUs but we expect people to buy the SKUs that meet their play style. What we’re seeing is that about a third of our growth is coming from that segmentation.

Now the second piece of it is also true that we’re trying to correct in 2023. The supply chain challenges going all the way back to the pandemic era carried through for us into this year.

There were sets that we expected to release earlier in the year that got delayed. In one case it was a glue that we needed that we couldn’t source. We ended up with two big sets released within four weeks of each other. It should be closer to two months. That’s not ideal. It’s not what we wanted.

Then equally we had the two micro-sets — Unfinity and Warhammer 40K — release on the same day. So collectively that’s about the size of another tentpole set. None of this was by design and we don’t intend to replicate that going forward.

With the recent cancellation of the G4 cable network which was partnered with Wizards at one point to produce original live-play content where do you see live-play fitting into Wizards’ strategy going forward?

At its core Magic is about face-to-face interaction. We’re delighted to have Arena to allow people to play when and where they want to but at its core this is about sitting down face-to-face.

We’re excited that we’ve got this tailwind of people being able to gather again. We’re seeing play in those events get almost back to pre-pandemic levels and we do believe that we’re going to be able to grow that.

When you think about streaming and content creators we had a great success with the World Championships at the 30th anniversary event in Las Vegas. That’s key and important to us for streamers to be able to continue to do that.

If you’re asking about esports that’s not a place where we’re going to continue to invest.

In my time at Xbox I also had [streaming platform] Mixer for a very short amount of time. I do believe in the power of being able to watch other people play and there are a number of things we are working on to give people an opportunity to stream.

We appreciate the value and success of things like Critical Role (a web series about playing D&D). When we look at D&D Beyond we think that you should think of it as the front door. You should be able to come there and find what you’re looking for including a watch space.

A big topic of conversation on social media has been the recent announcement that D&D will move away from the term “race” and use “species” instead. Can you speak to what internally motivated that change?

What I can say is this: we are continuing to evolve how we think about this space. I talked before about how important diversity is to us and how we see that as a strength.

We do think that this was language that was not necessarily representative of how we think about that term now and the team felt pretty passionate about finding a replacement. We don’t believe that a character’s race predetermines things about them.

It’s an interesting choice of words.

I think it’s important to remember that One D&D (a new publishing initiative) is at the point of playtest. I don’t think that we have finalized that the word will be “species.” It’s a word being tested.

Belgian game developer Larian Studios will bring out the highly anticipated D&D-based RPG Baldur’s Gate 3 in 2023. (Larian Studios image)

We’ve recently written about the new video game developers you’ve acquired like Invoke Studios. Can you talk about where you see Wizards going in the video game development field?

We’ve announced six different studios that are first-party and owned. There’s Archetype in Austin that’s working on a sci-fi game that we’re really excited about. It’s a new IP.

You’ve got Atomic Arcade in Raleigh-Durham that’s working on a very mature G.I. Joe game and then Invoke is working on a D&D game. The key piece I’d tell you is that we have been really fortunate to hire some amazing industry veterans who have a passion for the brands and games that they’re building.

There are also instances where we are licensing out IP to people. Later this week Larian Studios will announce the official launch date for Baldur’s Gate 3. We’re super excited about that. [Larian announced at the 2022 Game Awards ceremony that BG3 will release in August 2023.]

We view it as that these games should be in service to a brand and they should be giving fans another way to experience that brand. We’re delighted to have such phenomenal talent both on our team and in our partners building it.

So you see that as broadening your approach so to speak.

Video games are the biggest fastest-growing form of entertainment on the planet. I think it is a critical way to give fans a different way to enjoy a brand and game that they love. I do view it as critical for reaching more of the players around the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMvYmVjb21lLWJvYmEtZmV0dC13aXRoLWhhc2Jyb3MtbmV3ZXN0LWtpZC1mcmllbmRseS1lbGVjdHJvbmljLW1hc2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Become Boba Fett with Hasbro's Newest Kid-Friendly Electronic Mask,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/collectibles/become-boba-fett-with-hasbros-newest-kid-friendly-electronic-mask/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMvYmVjb21lLWJvYmEtZmV0dC13aXRoLWhhc2Jyb3MtbmV3ZXN0LWtpZC1mcmllbmRseS1lbGVjdHJvbmljLW1hc2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

The money will go to strengthen and expand the state’s healthcare workforce and career opportunities for students.

The funding is part of HCA Healthcare’s ongoing commitment to partnering with organizations to help develop a diverse pool of future healthcare leaders.

“The ability to provide care for our communities today and for the future fully depends on a robust healthcare workforce” HCA Florida Fort Walton-Destin Hospital Chief Executive Officer Zach McCluskey said. “We are proud to partner with Okaloosa Technical College to ensure the future generation of healthcare workers have an opportunity to attain a high-quality degree or industry certification to help serve the future healthcare needs for North Florida and the surrounding communities.”



The hospital says it's always on the look out for opportunities to collaborate with organizations to expand their outreach and attract compassionate talented individuals to the healthcare field.

“At HCA Healthcare we believe partnerships are essential to advancing our mission to care for and improve human lives” HCA Florida Fort Walton-Destin Hospital Chief Nursing Officer Caroline Stewart said. “Partnering with organizations like Okaloosa Technical College allows us to do more for our communities than we can do separately.”

Klauer DO EJD Chief Executive Office of the AOA announced his plans to leave the organization effective December 31. He has accepted a position with HCA Healthcare and will return to one of his greatest passions a role directly supporting patient care.

Dr. Klauer took over the position of CEO in June 2019 and has been an integral part of the countless significant positive advancements made on behalf of the AOA and the osteopathic medical profession during his time with us.

“It is impossible to recognize all of the accomplishments made during Dr Klauer’s tenure as the AOA’s CEO” said Ernst R. Gelb DO FACOFP president of the AOA. He added “As Dr. Klauer has said on many occasions ‘Many hands make light work.’ His collaborative approach and spirit have benefited our association immeasurably as an organization of selfless service to the osteopathic profession and beyond. His leadership has reflected the same and has helped to position the AOA for a bright and successful future.”

This past week the AOA recognized Dr. Klauer’s efforts by hanging his portrait at the national headquarters in Chicago. During that event he noted “It has been a true honor and pleasure to serve the AOA its Board of Trustees membership and staff. I will be forever grateful for the opportunity. Although I am very excited about my new role with HCA I’m equally sad to step away from the AOA and those we serve.”

The AOA has initiated a national search for the association’s new CEO. Kathleen Creason MBA has been named Interim CEO to guide the organization through this important transition.

Consumer Reports identified both cadmium and lead in chocolate brands like Trader Joe's and Hu.

Dangerous heavy metals including lead may be lurking in your favorite dark chocolate brands according to new test results released by Consumer Reports.

The consumer advocacy nonprofit tested 28 different dark chocolate bars from popular brands. They found that all but five of them contained high enough levels of contaminants that eating an ounce per day could put an adult over the levels typically considered safe.

Chocolate from brands including Tony's Lindt Hershey's and Hu were found to contain comparatively high levels of lead.

Exposure to lead is linked to cognitive impairment particularly in children since it can lead to developmental issues and lower IQ. It can also cause reproductive problems in adults as well as high blood pressure and neurological issues according to the Mayo Clinic.

High levels of cadmium were detected in Lindt Dove and Beyond Good products among others. The mineral is considered cancer-causing and exposure over time is linked to kidney disease and fragile bones according to the CDC.

One Trader Joe's bar was found to contain high levels of both lead and cadmium.

Dark chocolate tends to be higher in heavy metals than milk chocolate because it contains more cacao the bean used to make chocolate which can be contaminated either from the soil its grown in or after the beans are picked researchers told Consumer Reports.

The levels found in the testing don't violate any laws according to Consumer Reports since there are no federal limits for lead and cadmium in most foods.

But a major risk of heavy metals is that they can build up in the body over time causing health issues as repeated tiny doses add up according to the Cleveland Clinic.

As a result it's worth being aware of the risk and there may be ways to reduce your exposure by opting for products with lower levels like some of the chocolate bars tested according to the food safety researchers at Consumer Reports.

""That shows it's possible for companies to make products with lower amounts of heavy metals—and for consumers to find safer products that they enjoy"" said Tunde Akinleye the Consumer Reports food safety researcher who led the testing project.

Several of the mentioned brands contacted for comment by Insider referred to a statement by the the National Confectioners Association which cites a settlement in California related to contamination concerns.

""The products cited in this study are in compliance with strict quality and safety requirements and the levels provided to us by Consumer Reports testing are well under the limits established by our settlement"" the statement reads in part. ""Food safety and product quality remain our highest priorities and we remain dedicated to being transparent and socially responsible.""

Dark chocolate is often considered a healthier choice but steer clear of contaminants

Despite concern about contamination there's good reason to enjoy dark chocolate occasionally.

Evidence suggests dark chocolate is hearty-healthy helping to lower cholesterol and blood pressure thanks to beneficial plant-based compounds called flavonoids.

In contrast milk chocolate has fewer flavonoids and more additives such as sugar. The tradeoff however is that the nutrient-rich cacao can be the source of the contaminants found by Consumer Reports.

Some researchers are looking to infuse the benefits of dark chocolate into sweeter milk chocolate varieties. For now your best bet may be moderation according to the Consumer Reports researcher.

One serving of dark chocolate is about an ounce or around 30 grams.

""Having a serving a few days a week especially with a product that has lower levels means you can eat dark chocolate without worrying unduly"" Akinleye said.",,,,,,,,,

Location

Just half a block away from Place Trocadero the Canopy by Hilton Paris Trocadero is an Eiffel Tower dream from a global chain hotel with a boutique feel. Place Trocadero on the west side of the Right Bank gives a stunning view of the Eiffel Tower and is walkable to area restaurants both locally focused and more touristy locations. The Arc de Triomphe is a short drive away.

Property

The hotel has a boutique feel from the exterior. When we checked in after 6 pm we had a limited amount of time in Paris and wanted to get out as soon as possible. We had intended to stay for just one night on this surprise stay before heading home from Europe. As such we missed out on the opportunity to visit the fitness center and we the newly reopened rooftop bar was set to open up the following night; we received a preview before its reopening with bubbles that allow guests to have an inside dining experience without the chilly night air effects during the winter months.

Some suites facing the courtyard feature an outdoor space with chairs and lanterns. The Eiffel tower is visible from the rooftop space and the hotel utilizes the space to grow herbs like Rosemary and Mint.

Hilton Honors Benefits

As a Hilton Honors Diamond member my family received an upgrade to a junior suite though it was simply a larger room and not a separate bedroom from the living space. The room had a balcony view that was not to be missed.

Canopy as a brand prioritizes sustainability. As such they do not include bottles of water in the rooms but rather an empty glass jar which can be filled in the lobby with purified water.

Breakfast is in the lobby bar and restaurant with both buffet and menu items. Hilton Honors Gold and Diamond elite members have a full breakfast benefit outside the United States for up to (4) registered guests per room.

Though it was beyond the hotel’s obligation they allowed us to pick some items from the buffet but also order from the menu. That was very generous and appreciated as some items on the buffet tempted us and others not as much.

In addition to hot buffet items a selection of fresh baked breads cereal packets and a variety of juices teas coffee and “detox” water were available.

Unavailable on the buffet were pancakes and french toast. We ordered one of each so our daughter could try both plus the “Chef’s Egg.” One of the more unique egg dishes we’ve had the salmon was mixed in with the poached egg dill and herb cream on the side. The french toast was also very very impressive. We recommend both.

Suite

Our room was slightly larger than others on our floor but the only difference was the shower and bath which would have eaten into some of the space of the room. The Canopy brand does a nice job of using space smartly. A good example of that is the abbreviated desk suffient for a laptop but not unnecessarily large.

The toilet water closet is to the left of the entrance convenient for families and those who may welcome guests. That said it’s the only such time I can recall no toilet in the bathroom (shower vanity and tub but toilet in the hallway.)

Bedroom

The bedroom had more than enough space a couch with pullout queen bed was made for our daughter. Without the bed pulled out there was a lot of room for a Parisian hotel and it was one more reason to love this hotel.

A Nespresso machine has plenty of coffee a minibar underneath with triggered slots and an open wardrobe that features space for luggage and a pair of large drawers underneath.

Balcony

The reason I chose this property was its proximity to the Eiffel tower due to our short stay. The balcony view was incredible and our daughter was elated to not only be so close but such stunning views with on-the-hour sparkling lights.

Bathroom

The water closet toilet (pictured below) was welcome as I mentioned before.

The bathroom had both a soaking bathtub and a very large shower with a vanity and large mirror.

I wasn’t familiar with the toiletry brand thankyou. I am surprised I hadn’t come across it sooner but we liked it.

Value

We loved our stay at the Canopy by Hilton Paris Trocadero. It reminded me that luxury isn’t just terrycloth robes and marble floors sometimes it’s a perfect location with a walkout to the Eiffel tower. Cash rates range from €330 to €650 or 80000 Hilton Honors points. In this instance as we value Honors points at 0.4¢/point (or $.004/point) readers should use points for their stay unless it drops below €320/night.

For the size of the premium room its great location the honoring of our elite benefits and the great staff there’s no question we will be back and recommend the same for LiveAndLetsFly.com readers.

Rather than publish two articles I thought I would represent both writers’ views of the hotel together.

Location

Callum: Located in the regenerated area near the Stratford International station The Gantry is a new addition to Hilton’s Curio Collection portfolio having opened in November 2021. The property is impressive and modern with all the amenities you would expect.

Getting there

Callum:

Visible from the eastern exit of Stratford International it takes around five minutes’ walk to get to The Gantry. The hotel is extremely convenient with easy access to the DLR the Jubilee and Central lines Greater Anglia services as well as Elizabeth Line trains. The latter will soon become even more effective and make access to Central and West London easier as the outer parts of the line connect to the inner core. This could make Stratford a more feasible place to base yourself when visiting London.

Gus: The hotel is about a 12-minute walk from Stratford tube on the Central and Jubilee line and right opposite Stratford International station on the DLR line.

Callum: The Gantry occupies the entire building and features a wavy design that sets it apart from the others in the same area. While it may not be universally popular the combination of the glass and brass-coloured metal looks beautiful.

Callum: The entrance continues the same look with an equally contrasting sign for the hotel.

Callum: Despite the beautiful exterior inside it all gets a little bit more eclectic. While there’s nothing wrong with this design on reflection I don’t get who thought the combination of random chairs would work. It’s all a little busy but perhaps that randomness makes it more welcoming.

Gus: From the outside it looks very attractive and fits in well with the other new developments in the area. Stratford remains a funny mix of shiny new signature buildings (Westfield Olympic Park etc.) and some of the slightly less appealing bits between them though common to it all is an energy and a buzz that only seems to be growing over time.

Check-in

Callum: On the positive the staff were very responsive and helpful with my check-in. They asked if I wished to add breakfast which I declined.

Gus: I checked in a little early and while there was no recognition of my (Gold) status the room was ready. I’d booked a King Deluxe Room for £220 which is the grade below the Suites (which sadly were all booked by the time I arrived so no upgrade either) though entry-level rooms seem to be available from £170. The check-in clerk was friendly enough and explained everything about the hotel and very swiftly I was on my way.

Food and drink

Callum: The ground floor is also host to a Hermanos Coffee Shop – which serves decent Colombian coffee but disappointing pastries.

Gus: The Gantry also has a Hermanos coffee bar on the ground floor which seemed to be full of both guests and passers-by which gave the hotel a bit more of a buzz than it might otherwise have had.

Gus: I had lunch in the hotel’s first-floor restaurant Union Social which was a really nice space with a range of tables spread across the windows. It included an extensive and impressive bar and also had an outdoor terrace area which would have been great on a less blustery and cool day.

The Rooms

Callum: Corridors in the hotel were well-lit and decorated making it feel homely and comfortable. The Curio Collection does allow for far more flexibility in its brand design rules than other Hilton brands which makes for a far more interesting stay.

Callum: On this visit I stayed in room 515 – a regular King Size bedroom. Anybody else feel like the fives on the door numbers are just the number two upside down?

Callum: The bed features a comfortable mattress with soft bedding and pillows which are not too soft providing enough support while in bed. A reading light and bedside table alongside plug USB sockets and wired telephone features only on one side.

Callum: The brass metallic look continues from the outside into the room using similar coloured materials representing a careful attention to detail by the property’s designers.

Callum: The lack of bedside table and reading lamp on one side is mitigated by the larger table that is in close vicinity of the bed. All the lighting in the bedroom is warm and creates a cosy ambience while relaxing.

Callum: The chaise longue next to the window provides another place to relax; however the lack of back support makes it slightly inadequate to be comfortable at. It is more for show than really being of use to guests. From this vantage point the view is unremarkable looking into other buildings as well as a gym. On the other side of the building the views may be slightly better looking over the station and Westfield Stratford.

Callum: Floor-to-ceiling blackout curtains cover the windows providing full and excellent elimination of external light through the windows aiding a comfortable sleep. To the right of the window is a tall wardrobe with plenty of hangers for a short stay as well as ironing facilities.

Callum: Opposite the bed is the typical wall-mounted television which is forty-two inches or so Samsung 4K model. Easily accessible plugs as well as HDMI ports can be found directly below to television to connect a device to the screen.

Callum: More interesting is what is found below – a large storage chest. The lid does open but the chest is located too close to the wall to open easily. It does feel like the sofa this is more decorative than anything else but it could be used for additional storage. Just don’t forget you’ve put items in there when you leave.

Callum: A large wall-height mirror can be found close to the television.

Callum: Near to the bathroom entrance a small area for drinks can be found. A selection of complimentary Clipper instant coffee and tea as well as tasty shortbread can be found. Glasses suitable for making alcoholic beverages are provided in the room although the fridge was not stocked with a minibar.

Callum: In this same area a pull-out safe can be found which is large enough to store a laptop.

Callum: The bathroom is a modern affair with the usual neutral colours utilised alongside a brighter feature wall. A large circular but unheated mirror is found above a wide washbasin. Despite the small footprint of the room the use of the large mirror makes the space feel bigger than it is.

Callum: A shower can also be found but no bath. An overhead rainfall shower and handheld wash head are provided although I found the former to be located off-centre which feels a bit weird and too close to one of the rooms.

Callum: The Gantry use ‘Grown Alchemist’ branded soap shampoo conditioner and moisturiser which are premium and have an excellent scent across all the items. A limited range of amenities are provided such as cotton pads and buds but not toothbrush and paste.

Hotel amenities

Callum: Hotels like The Gantry don’t really need to put too much effort into their amenities offering considering how much can be found in the immediate area. Despite this they have still put effort into creating an excellent offering for guests.

The first being a small but well-equipped gym with a variety of free weights several cardio machines as well as a cable machine. This selection makes most workouts feasible without needing to step foot outside of the property which is convenient for those wanting to catch a workout while travelling on business.

Callum: Two social spaces are also located within the property. The first is Union Social dubbed an ‘inclusive relaxed space to spend your down time’. I headed here for a quick coffee after arrival as the sun was setting and found it to be a comfortable space where guests could sit back with a drink or opt for food instead.

Callum: Although it wasn’t warm enough to sit outside on my visit there is also a terrace which could be a good place to meet others in summer.

Image source: The Gantry

Callum: Although not open yet The Gantry will also introduce a ‘Sky Bar and Terraces’ on the rooftop. Clearly not the most creative name for a rooftop bar but I suspect it will have some relaxing views looking across Stratford and into the city. No photos are provided but if it is of a similar quality as Union Social it should be a half-decent bar.

Conclusion

Callum: The Gantry is an attractive hotel that offers great rooms with excellent amenities at a competitive price with effective transport links. As noted in my introduction the addition of the Elizabeth Line alongside the pre-existing links to areas across London including Canary Wharf makes this a great option for visitors and business travellers. Prices seem to bottom out at around GBP 170 per night and are on average GBP 200 per night. For that price you are getting a lot of hotel for your money particularly when Central London properties are getting excessively expensive in recent months.

Gus: The Gantry is a solid bet for anyone needing to be in Stratford and you can see how it will become even more of a destination address itself as more and more opens in and around the site too.

HARTFORD Conn. — Sales reports from a local Home Depot confirmed the retail giant is yet to sell a single 12’ nativity set this Christmas season causing a massive inventory pile up in the store’s 6000 sq. ft Garden Center.

“When the 12’ skeletons sold out in a single day we thought wow we’re going to make a killing this Christmas” said Cindy Mathers the store’s manager. “We’re not really sure what’s driving the consumer reluctance. We even introduced multiple tiers to choose from – the Base Set which will get you Jesus Mary Joseph and one animal to the Ultra-Deluxe Nativity which gets you all eleven pieces with the bonus 15’ manger facade. I mean who wouldn’t want that in their front yard for six to eight weeks?”

Jay Ramirez is a homeowner in the nearby Colonial Heights neighborhood with a reputation for holiday home flare. Even he is reluctant to purchase the gigantic figures.

“I’m not afraid to go all out for the holidays but $4700 is a little steep” said Ramirez adhering a pair of reindeer antlers to his mailbox. “Besides that I only have a half-acre plot. I’m not sure I could even fit it all without spilling onto the Johnson’s lawn and ever since that Slip & Slide incident last summer I don’t want to rock the boat. And even if I could fit it I’m not sure I’d want to look at an adult man-sized baby Jesus every time I leave the house. That thing’s creepy.”

Cardinal Gregory O’Sullivan heads the Archdiocese of Hartford Connecticut and supports Home Depot’s efforts to sell the Nativity sets.

“I think it’s a big way to show your faith which is something we need a lot more of in these troubling times” said O’Sullivan. “The lack of sales directly reflects the spiritual crisis we seem to be in in this country. As a representative of the Catholic church I’d advise Home Depot to try and shuffle your inventory around to see if you can get a little more traction. If there’s a problem in this parish perhaps it might do better in another? Just a thought.”

As Christmas draws near the Home Depot is looking to recuperate their loss for the next major holiday with talks of a 12’ Martin Luther King Jr. slated to arrive in stores within the next couple of weeks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vc3RsamV3aXNobGlnaHQub3JnL3RvcC1zdG9yeS9waG90b3MtaHVuZHJlZHMtb2Yta2lkcy1idWlsZGluZy1tZW5vcmFocy1ub3NoaW5nLWxhdGtlcy1hdC1ob21lLWRlcG90L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Hundreds of kids building menorahs noshing latkes at Home Depot -,"After a two-year COVID hiatus the Home Depot Chanukah Experience is back!

The event which is held by Home Depot and Chabad of Greater St. Louis originated in St. Louis 14 years ago and is now held in Home Depot locations around the country.

Rabbi Levi Landa of Chabad of Greater St. Louis began co-hosting a menorah workshop at Home Depot in 2008. The workshop expanded into a mini-Hanukkah fair.

There are three chances: Slim fat and none.

This case is appalling but hardly unusual. In fact it’s become standard operating procedure not just in Massachusetts which is obviously a lost cause but in America itself.

No perps get punished anymore for anything. The get-out-of-jail free card applies to everyone but especially to illegal aliens — undocumented Democrats.

These six “Providence men” include Abner Perez Miguel Perez and Johnathon Amperez-Perez — do you begin to detect a pattern? And si that is his listed surname Amperez-Perez.

The senors were busted a week ago Friday morning at the Home Depot on the VFW Parkway.

When Boston police arrived they found that the suspects had stuffed $13518.79 worth of wire into a boxed-up bathtub for which they were going to pay $339. The previous day the police reported they had stolen $17989 worth of electrical wire from the same store.

They were arrested and brought before West Roxbury District Court Judge Kathleen Coffey who once tried to restore the state pension that had been revoked from Whitey Bulger’s jailbird convicted felon hack brother Jackie.

The hack judge Coffey reasoned that merely trying to help a serial killer stay on the lam by committing perjury before a federal grand jury did not represent a dereliction by Jackie Bulger of his sworn duties as a high-ranking hack court official in Massachusetts.

But I digress.

The van the Providence men were using had an expired MA registration and the attached license plates had been lifted from another vehicle according to police.

Inside the van the cops found paperwork from Homeland Security and the Tennessee DMV as well as receipts from at least four other Home Depots in two states.

In court the prosecutor pointed out to the Bulger judge that three of the newcomers to our land had “pending Worcester cases” as well as ICE detainers — you know from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He asked the judge to revoke their bail.

The judge refused naturally. The DA then asked for $2500 cash bail. Hell no. The ones with ICE detainers had their bail set at $1500. The other three had bail set at $1000.

Somewhere Judge Shelley Joseph was nodding her approval of her fellow Democrat jurist’s… compassion.

This all took place in a courtroom with Spanish interpreters for one and all or should I say para uno y todos. A “Providence woman” showed up with cash to bail them all out. It is a great country no? At least if you’re an illegal alien criminal.

Here’s another twist: they were originally charged with aggravated organized retail crime over $10000 a no-brainer considering the cops recovered more than $31000 worth of stolen electrical wire from the low-rider van.

Yet mysteriously the charges were reduced to the lesser count of “larceny over $1000.”

Oh I forgot Judge Coffey did issue one stern warning to los muchachos. They are all to stay out of Home Depots. Using the same logic she employed when slobbering over the Bulgers I guess it will be okay for them to shift their operations over to… Lowe’s.

This is how it goes everywhere. No one does anything about this crime wave. And it’s only going to get worse next week when Title 42 expires and hundreds of thousands of more of these Third World career criminals swarm across what remains of the border.

When the Jamaicans robbed the bank on Martha’s Vineyard last month nobody dared mention what was known immediately — that the gun-wielding thugs had island accents. The cops didn’t want to be accused of… profiling I suppose.

Here’s another recent pinch. Last Saturday night in Saugus the cops pulled over an erratic driver who claimed to be Sugentino Patricio Percel Uben of where else Lynn.

According to the police report inside the vehicle the cops recovered more than 15 grams of crack cocaine and 24 grams of fentanyl or heroin. On his person they found $8461 in cash including $2440 in his Nikes. They also found foreign currency — pesos and one birr which is apparently Ethiopian.

Guess what happened when the cops fingerprinted him — he’d been arrested under at least three other aliases.

As the arresting officer wryly noted using modern PC lingo “While identifying as (Carlos Antonio) Rodriguez Uben was arrested on 07/23/1998 in Corpus Christi Texas for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. He was convicted of same.”

Riddle me this Batman: How is it that a convicted illegal alien drug dealer who’d done serious time in Texas would wind up in… Lynn? Go figure.

But even Americans no longer get much beyond a slap on the wrist except under the most extreme circumstances.

Take Christopher Keeley the 27-year-old who is charged with slaughtering an elderly Marshfield couple last month. He then fled to Miami Beach where he dyed his hair a garish reddish-pink to blend into the Collins Avenue demimonde.

You should see how many horrific earlier charges were broomed in Quincy for this Keeley bird despite his racial handicaps. (He’s white and Irish.) But that’s a topic for another day.

The reality is this utter breakdown of the criminal justice system is yet another reason why tens of thousands of law-abiding working-class Americans are fleeing the Commonwealth.

Remember Rachael Rollins? She was elected district attorney of Suffolk County in 2018 on what amounted to a platform of coddling “Providence men” and “Lynn men.” Now thanks to Brandon she’s the U.S. attorney here.

But there are glimmers that even Rollins is beginning to recognize the folly of her party’s policies.

In her office’s sentencing memo on drug dealer Yo Pesci (now postponed until February) she noted how the lenient Lynn-man treatment has straightened out Yo Pesci — NOT!

She asked for a 10-year sentence for the obese thug.

“Just punishment must significantly escalate from the relatively light sentences he has received in the past for his troubling crimes. It’s clear that the prior sentences only emboldened the Defendant and his conduct.”

Ya think? Is it possible Rachael Rollins is finally waking up? Nah probably not.

Honeywell Flour Mills can be bought in the stock market at about N17 billion in raw cash as the food producer company’s share lost about 43% in 2022 despite reasonable rallies in the local bourse.

Apparently the worst performer in the Nigerian bourse in the current year trailed by University Press Plc and Livestock Feed Plc according to data from stocks screened by MarketForces Africa.

Share price depreciation follows its recent acquisition by its immediate competing brand Flour Mills of Nigeria setting a mandatory takeover price at N4.20 the price that its block trade was executed.

Recall that Ecowise Horizon and Greywise Investment solutions limited subsidiaries of Flour Mills of Nigeria acquired 75% of the foods producing company during the year Good money continues to seek opportunities and trading activities in the stock market have become intense amidst a rising inflation rate.

Stockbrokers are executing large buying orders while investors continue to cherry picking and rally around companies with good fundamentals with healthy earnings outlooks.

However some companies listed in the local bourse have been burning investors’ net worth over persistent decline in their respective share prices. Growing numbers of stocks have been re-rated due to improved market sentiment.

Companies with weak earnings have been dumped while market participants continue to rebalance their portfolios ahead of the fourth quarter earnings season. >>>Honeywell Share Price Jumps Midday over FMN Acquisition Deal

It suffices to say that lower price provides entry points or even possible opportunity to dilute losses. With the recent rally in the stock market the loss level has been reduced but highly volatile and heavy burden non-performance still has a large carryover that stockholders may not recoup in 2022.

At the close of the market on Friday Ticker: HONYFLOUR printed at N2.12 as analysts advised investors to sell the stocks on an expectation of low upside potential. Also University Press Plc investors have suffered losses as the company’s share price dropped to N1.73 losing 41.16% from the beginning of the year to date.

Sold at N1.19 per share in the local bourse Livestock Feed has burned down invested funds having lost 38.34% from the beginning of the year to date. The share price of Red Star Express has tumbled by 32.54% as it ended at N2.26 on Friday despite the ongoing rally in the local bourse.

Custodian Insurance has become so cheap also. The Insurance Company has lost 31.41% of its opening valuation in the year thus ranked among the worst performer in the domestic bourse.

In the bellwether category it appears that GTCO has broken value in the banking segment with about a 20% decline in valuation amidst weak earnings performance that started after its holding company’s restructuring.

Nestlé Nigeria Plc has also lost significantly in the year as the closely-held dividend aristocrat share price plunged to N980 having peaked at N1440 in the year. From the beginning of the year to date Nestles Nigeria has lost a whopping 29.75% of its market valuation.

The unique leadership program took place for two consecutive weeks at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville Alabama. This year Honeywell chose eight students from Bangalore and two students from Pune.

The HLCA is a scholarship program for children of Honeywell employees worldwide that offers a weeklong immersive science-oriented leadership experience. It is designed to encourage high school students ages 16-18 years old to pursue careers in science technology engineering and math (STEM) through real-world hands-on activities in computer science engineering astronautics and coding.

""For more than 10 years Honeywell has brought together students from around the world to travel to the U.S. Space and Rocket Center to experience Space Camp helping to build their technical collaborative and communications skills"" said Jayme Meyer Honeywell vice president Internal Communications and Corporate Social Responsibility. ""Today the 30 fastest-growing occupations globally are in STEM and Honeywell is proud to partner with the USSRC to empower the next generation of future-shaping innovators and leaders.""

Students are selected for the program through a rigorous application and review process based on academic achievement and community involvement. Honeywell and its employees help fund the scholarships which cover the cost of tuition meals accommodations and program materials. Yatharth Nehra a participant from Pune said ""It was a great learning and networking experience. I believe there are only very few organizations that provide the advantage and the diverse knowledge as HLCA provides. Honeywell understands that the future is now and the future is us. I would like to thank Honeywell for providing me with this opportunity.""

""Honeywell Leadership Challenge Academy at US Space and Rocket Center was once in a lifetime experience for me. It was a rare combination of technical knowledge hands-on experience meeting legends and having loads of fun"" said Bidipta Chatterjee a participant from Bengaluru.

Bengaluru student Nisha Jain reminisced ""It was a wonderful opportunity to build my leadership qualities challenge myself across different fields and also meet and learn from my peers from different cultures. We learned how to work as a team with mission control & incident control challenge build a rocket code a raspberry pi train on MATs use a flight simulator experience 1/6 gravity and climbed a 40-foot wall! Proud to have been selected for HLCA.""

Since its launch in 2010 Honeywell in partnership with the USSRC has sponsored nearly 3000 students to attend space camps. Participants develop STEM leadership skills through numerous team-building challenges such as building coding and testing rockets; simulated astronaut training; shuttle missions; and a low-gravity moonwalk. Students also use computational thinking and computer science to deepen their digital skills.

10 Companies that Should do a Stock Split in 2023 (but Probably Won't)

I have a confession to make...

When I first started investing in the stock market I would often choose to buy a stock which was lower priced over a higher priced stock.

Investors especially beginners are often drawn towards buying stocks which are relatively low priced and tend to stay away from higher priced stocks.

But as Albert Einstein once said ""The only source of knowledge is experience.""

As investors including yours truly learn with experience in reality it is not the price but rather the value of stocks that should matter.

So why is that most retail investors prefer lower priced stocks?

Simply because as an investor one feels a sense of satisfaction and pride buying a larger quantity of shares say 10000 shares of Vodafone Idea trading at Rs 9 as compared to buying just 1 share of MRF at Rs 90000.

And then there is also a wrong notion that a lot of investors have that a stock priced at Rs 10 has a higher probability of doubling or tripling as compared to a stock priced at Rs 1000.

But again that may not hold true. Once again let's take the example of Vodafone and MRF.

In December 2012 shares of Vodafone traded close to Rs 100 whereas MRF traded at just above Rs 12000 levels.

Since then MRF is up over 7.5x whereas Vodafone has lost over 92% of its value.

Value investing is a broader philosophy that involves buying a company at a price that is lower than its intrinsic value.

Hence while investing in stocks it is wise to keep an eye not just on price but also on the value of the stocks.

For instance the stock of Shree Cement Ltd trades close to Rs 25000 levels whereas Ambuja Cements Ltd is currently priced at under Rs 600.

For a layman it seems that Shree Cements is highly over priced as compared to Ambuja Cements?

But on a closer look we realise that the valuations are perfectly justified if we compare the financials of both companies.

FY 2022 (In Rs billion) Shree Cement Ltd Ambuja Cement Ltd Revenue 143.1 139.6 Net Profit 23.8 20.8 Market Cap 877 1165 Price to Earnings Ratio 53.4 59.8 Price to Book Ratio 4.9 5.1

Source: Equitymaster

Although the price of shares is determined by the forces of demand and supply on a day-to-day basis fundamentally it is also a function of the total number of shares issued by a company.

In case of Shree Cements Ltd the company has 36 million (m) equity shares issued and available for trade. On the other hand Ambuja Cements has issued a total of 1.9 billion (bn) equity shares.

Over the years Ambuja Cement has declared four bonus issues and split its shares once from a face value of Rs 10 to Rs 2. All of this has resulted in the number of shares significantly increasing to the present outstanding of 1.9 bn shares.

Shree Cements has chosen to not issue any bonuses nor has it ever announced a stock split.

There could be various reasons why a company may not choose to split its stock.

A company could choose to keep its share price high to keep the stock concentrated in the hands of a few shareholders usually the promoters.

Higher prices also help in checking the price volatility of shares as it would keep retail investors and day traders away.

Shares trading at a higher price are difficult to buy or sell which allows promoters to retain significant voting rights in their hands allowing them to make critical decisions without much interference.

And then of course there is the matter of pride... some promoters might believe that a high share price might enhance the reputation of their company.

So should a company allow its shares to trade at high prices or split its shares?

There is no definitive answer for this question as there is no evidence that suggests that a stock split is the right thing to do nor are there any SEBI regulations for splitting of shares.

Investors have the option to buy even one share of a company if they choose to.

Here is the list of 10 companies that should do a stock split in 2023 but probably won't!

1. MRF Ltd

Madras Rubber Factory commonly known as MRF Tyres is an Indian Multinational tyre manufacturing company.

The company is the largest tyre manufacturer in India and accounts for about 25% of the total tyre sales in the country.

MRF has a total of 4.2 m shares outstanding of which the promoters hold 27.8% in the company as on date.

In 1970 and 1975 MRF offered a bonus in the ratio of 1:2 and 3:10 respectively. But there have been no share splits.

MRF Ltd FY 2022 (In Rupees) Revenue (Crore) 18989.5 Net Profit (Crore) 647.3 Face Value 10.0 EPS 1526.3 P/E 71.8 P/B 2.7 Equity 42400000.0 No of Shares Issued 4240000.0 Current Market Price 91150.0 Current Market Cap (Crore) 38645.0

Source: Equitymaster

For the year ended 31 March 2022 the company reported sales of Rs 189 bn and PAT of Rs 6.4 bn. With its tiny equity capital of just Rs 42 m this resulted in an eye-popping earnings per share (EPS) of Rs 1526.

Even though the stock has always been high priced it has still delivered a return of 640% over the last 10 years which proves that a high-priced stock can still be an outperformer if the valuations are justified.

Interestingly due to its high price the average quantity of shares traded per day on BSE stands at just 1482 with average number of trades at 885.

This works out to an average of just 1.6 shares (essentially 1 or 2 shares) bought and sold per trade! Such are the quirks of being the most expensive stock traded in India.

2. Page Industries Ltd

Page Industries Ltd is a manufacturer and retailer of innerwear leisurewear and socks and the exclusive licensee of Jockey International in India Sri Lanka Nepal Bangladesh the United Arab Emirates Oman Qatar Maldives and Bhutan.

Page Industries is also the exclusive licensee of Speedo International Ltd. for the manufacture marketing and distribution of the Speedo brand in India.

The stock has come a long way since its initial public offer (IPO) price of Rs 395 per share in March 2007 and currently trades at Rs 46700 per share a massive gain of 11700% over the last 15 years.

Page Industries Ltd FY 2022 (In Rupees) Revenue (Crore) 3886.5 Net Profit (Crore) 536.5 Face Value 10.0 EPS 481.0 P/E 70.5 P/B 39.3 Equity 111538740 No of Shares Issued 11153874 Current Market Price 46700.0 Current Market Cap (Crore) 52088.0

Source: Equitymaster

Revenue grew 37% to Rs 38.8 bn and net profit jumped 58% to Rs 5.3 bn for the financial year ended 31 March 2022.

The promoters hold 46.1% stake in the company whereas retail investors hold only 7.2% of the total capital.

The stock has been on a tear generating 1257% return over the last 10 years for its shareholders.

On an average 682 shares of the company were traded on the BSE per day since the beginning of the year.

3. Honeywell Automation India Ltd

The stock has climbed from Rs 100 in January 1999 to the current market price of Rs 42840 representing a multi-bagger return of 42740%.

An investment of Rs 10000 made in this stock in 1999 would have grown to Rs 4284000 today.

Honeywell Automation India Ltd FY 2022 (In Rupees) Revenue (Crore) 2948.3 Net Profit (Crore) 339.1 Face Value 10.0 EPS 383.5 P/E 100.4 P/B 12.9 Equity 88415230.0 No of Shares Issued 8841523.0 Current Market Price 42840.0 Current Market Cap (Crore) 37878.0

Source: Equitymaster

The company reported a net profit of Rs 3.3 bn for the financial year 2022 as opposed to Rs 4.6 bn for FY2021. Revenue declined 3% year over year to Rs 29.4 bn from Rs 30.4 bn in the previous year.

The stock which touched it's lifetime high of Rs 49799 on 12 March 2021 on BSE declined thereafter losing 39% to Rs 30460 over the next fourteen months.

Since then the stock has recovered and is currently trading at levels just under Rs 43000.

As the price has risen as expected the number of shares traded per day has declined equally dramatically.

In 2012 at an average price of Rs 2564 on an average 4461 shares were traded per day on BSE. In 2022 as the price per share has risen to over Rs 42000 the average shares traded per day has declined to just 304.

However the year 2022 has been very volatile for the stock as it has swung in a wide range between Rs 18000 and Rs 27500. Currently the stock trades at just above Rs 24000 levels.

5. 3M India Ltd

Source: Equitymaster

Nestle has declared 5 bonuses since its listing with its last bonus declared in 1996. However the company has resisted any stock split issuance till date hence keeping its share price out of reach of most small-time investors.

Source: Equitymaster

Bosch is only one of two companies on our list which has actually split its shares once from a face value of Rs 100 to Rs 10 in 2004. The company has also declared 4 bonus issues since its listing.

Had the company not split its shares MRF would have lost its title as the most expensive stock of India by a mile.

Bosch Ltd would be crowned king with a mind-boggling price of Rs 176000 per share!

The company has 29.4 m outstanding shares. The promoters holding 70.5% of the shares while retail investors hold a miniscule 7% stake in the company.

After peaking in March 2015 where the stock traded above Rs 27000 levels the stock has been unable to cross the highs and over the last seven years gradually declined.

Even then an investment of Rs 10000 in shares of Bosch in December 2002 would be valued at Rs 567742 a CAGR of 22.3%

9. Proctor & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care Ltd (P&G)

The stock of P&G has given its shareholders a CAGR of 19.7% over the last 20 years.

10. Lakshmi Machine Works Ltd

Lakshmi Machine Works Limited (LMW) one of only three companies in the world to produce the whole spectrum of spinning machinery is a leading manufacturer of textile machinery in India.

LMW was established in 1962 in Coimbatore and today in addition to serving the domestic market also exports goods to Asia Australia New Zealand and New Guinea.

LMW has 60% market share in the domestic textile spinning machinery industry and is a brand leader in manufacturing customized products.

The company has declared 2 bonuses in 1989 and 1997 and is the second stock on our list to have split its shares from a face value of Rs 100 to Rs 10 in 2006.

Lakshmi Machine Works Ltd FY 2022 (In Rupees) Revenue (Crore) 3071.5 Net Profit (Crore) 179.6 Face Value 10.0 EPS 168.1 P/E 48.1 P/B 6.9 Equity 106800000.0 No of Shares Issued 10680000.0 Current Market Price 13620.0 Current Market Cap (Crore) 14551.0

Shareholders of LMW have been rewarded with a phenomenal CAGR of 27.6% over the last 20 years.

The stock has had a stellar run from its lows of Rs 2124 on 24 March 2020 and jumped 541% till date making it a multi-bagger stock.

This is Earth Calling... Any Plans to Come Down in 2023?

Many companies offer a split of shares to make them more affordable to investors.

In fact stock splits have been a rage in 2022 with the world's most valuable companies announcing massive splits.

Amazon completed its first split in more than a decade with a 20:1 split which resulted in the price changing from US$2785 to US$139 hence allowing more participation for investors in the retail behemoth.

Google-parent Alphabet completed a 20-for-one stock split for its shares in mid-July as well. The split reduced its price per share from US$2235.55 to US$111.77 bringing cheer to wall street investors.

Tesla also completed a 3-for-1 split in August 2022. In 2020 the most valuable company Apple had also split its shares on a 4:1 basis.

Of course these stock prices had reached astronomical levels and the split was justified to ensure maximum retail participation.

At times however there may not be any visible logic for a stock split.

For instance back home this year Dev Information Technology Ltd announced a stock split from Rs 10 to Rs 5 per share.

This resulted in the stock price halving from Rs 230 to Rs 115 which in effect doesn't seem to make much of a difference.

So will any of the companies on our list finally split their shares in 2023? After all they are highly priced and a split would allow a lot more participation from Dalal street investors.

It seems unlikely... here's why.

Barring MRF and Lakshmi Machine Works the average promoter holding in most companies stands above 70%

Further six of the ten companies on our list have foreign promoters for whom there is no incentive to increase trading volumes in their stocks.

All these companies have outperformed the broader markets over the years with their strong fundamentals. Hence they would not feel the need to bring in a greater number of shareholders to drive volumes or their stock prices.

Stock splits do not alter the financial fundamentals of a company. The ratios don't change and the value of share capital also remains the same. So a split doesn't provide any benefit to these companies.

On the contrary these companies would prefer to keep a smaller investor base so that majority of voting rights remain within the company allowing them to make strategic decisions without any conflict.

Keeping prices higher also decreases volatility in the stocks hence lowering chances of any hostile takeovers or acquisitions.

Finally who doesn't want to retain their uniqueness. After all being among the top ten most expensive stocks in India is a matter of great prestige!

Also other than writing I'm completely unemployable!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvc2hzMTQtdHJpbGxpb24tcmVmaW5lcnktZGVhbC1zZXQtdG8tYmUtY2xvc2VkLTQwNTg1NTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shs14 trillion refinery deal set to be closed,"A joint venture of American and Italian firms awarded the tender to design finance and construct Uganda’s Greenfield oil refinery has hinted on closing the $4 billion (Shs14 trillion) Final Investment Decision (FID) for the project next year.

The Albertine Graben Refinery Consortium (AGRC) closed the agreement on capital investments or FID this week on the sidelines of the US-Africa Leaders Summit in the US capital Washington according to a statement from State House.

“The announcement today brings Uganda and the region one step closer to a long-held dream: to add value to our resources and achieve energy security and economic prosperity for all its citizens” Mr Museveni was quoted as saying.

AGRC’s executives were led by Ms Rajakumari Jandhyala the chief executive of Washington DC-based Yaatra Ventures LLC and the presidents of Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) Eastern and Southern Trade and Development Bank (TDB) Honeywell Baker Hughes.

AGRC is a special purpose vehicle formed by America’s General Electric International Operations Company Inc Italy’s Saipem SpA Mauritius-based private equity fund Intra-continental Asset Holdings (IA) and Washington DC based Yaatra Ventures LLC.

The consortium had been beaten to the tender by a Chinese joint venture but the deal was flipped on the premise of balancing foreign interests in Uganda’s oil sector.

The upstream (operation of the oil fields) are French TotalEnergies EP and China’s CNOOC which also carry stake in midstream (East African Crude Oil Pipeline).

The refinery once developed will be the first American-Italian investment in Uganda.

AGRC was handed the refinery tender on the basis of among others the reputable companies in its stable (General Electric with an estimated turnover of $300 billion and Saipem SpA) which meant “good corporate governance and strong project risk management principles” capable of attracting private equity financing.

The refinery is expected to be financed in a Public Private Partnership arrangement of 60:40 ratio.

The government’s 40 percent equity share is equivalent to Shs2 trillion ($500 million) and was defined in December 2017 by the Uganda National Oil Company (Unoc) shareholders; the ministries of Finance and Energy at their last annual general meeting.

Uganda’s share will be carried through the Uganda Refinery Holding Company a subsidiary of Unoc which is mandated to manage the country’s commercial interests in the oil sector.

Kenya and Tanzania had initially offered to buy 2.5 percent and eight percent stakes respectively as part of Uganda’s 40 percent share. TotalEnergies E&P also offered to buy a 10 percent stake leaving the government with roughly 19 percent stake. It remains unclear how far discussions progressed.





Standing his ground

After announcing discovery of commercial oil volumes in 2006 President Museveni stood his ground on developing a local refinery even when the project economics remain unconvincing for some industry players.

The President has variously argued that there is a ready market in Uganda for the locally refined petroleum products and a captive market in Rwanda East Congo and other neighbouring countries—making Uganda’s refinery viable.

According to the Energy ministry Uganda’s fuel/petroleum products imports as of last September averaged 85 million litres with demand growing at seven percent per annum.

The planned refinery will produce Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) diesel petrol kerosene jet fuel and Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO).

Uganda’s petroleum products imports as of mid- last September averaged at 85 million with demand growing at seven percent per annum according to the Energy ministry.

During the Washington meeting AFC’s chief executive officer Samaila Zubairu said they are one of the early-stage investors and committed to investing and supporting the mobilisation of capital from partners for the economically transformative refinery project.

The Maserati MC20 is an ideal car for tuning. With a carbon fiber safety cell the new supersport car from Modena weighs only 1475 kg (3252 lb) and is lighter than any Porsche 911 version.Edo Competition has modified the Nettuno V6 engine control unit a unique construction with a pre-chamber and dual injection system - direct and indirect.Thus the engine power has been increased from 630 ps (621 hp) to 705 ps (695 ps) and the maximum torque reaches 800 Nm (590 lb ft) compared to 730 Nm (538.4 lb ft) in the production model.However the result is not quite as spectacular in terms of performance. Top speed was increased by only 5 kph (3.1 mph) from 320 kph (199 mph) to 325 km/h (202 mph) and acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h (0-62 mph) is 2.9 seconds compared to 2.88 seconds in the production model.But Edo Competition promises a visual and acoustic spectacle thanks to the new rear silencer made of stainless steel with new exhaust tops made of milled aluminum developed in cooperation with Capristo Automotive. The tailpipes also look spectacular thanks to their generous 125 mm (4.92 in) diameter and gold-colored anodized coating.Edo Competition also fitted new larger-diameter forged wheels. Instead of the standard 20-inch rims The german tuner opts for 11-spoke wheels measuring 9.5 x 21 inches at the front and 12 x 22 inches at the rear with 255/30 tires at the front and 325/25 at the back.Edo Competition is a tuner that focuses on tuning Porsche Ferrari  Lamborghini Mercedes Audi and Lamborghini models.The founder of the company Edo Karabegovic was educated in a Ferrari workshop in southern Germany and was part of various racing teams.

Five Gophers football players announced their intentions to leave the program five straight days after Minnesota beat Wisconsin for Paul Bunyan’s Axe in the regular-season finale Nov. 26.

Then after a few days with no movement defensive back Michael Dixon a key piece in the team’s plans for 2023 said Dec. 4 he was out too and on Dec. 7 veteran linebacker Braelen Oliver added he was done as well. All told Minnesota has had seven players exit since the NCAA transfer portal opened.

Meanwhile the Gophers have added two transfers via the portal for a net loss of five players.

Compared to its Big Ten West competition as of Friday morning Minnesota has had the third-fewest departures behind Illinois (minus-1) and Purdue (minus-3). Iowa is at minus-7 Wisconsin and Northwestern are minus-8 and Nebraska is last at minus-12.

“Fans in college football especially in Minnesota need to wrap our heads around it a little bit: The game has changed. Recruiting has changed. Transferring has changed” Gophers head coach P.J. Fleck said on Dec. 4. “Transfer used to be ‘Oh what’s wrong?’ That just happens (now). A guy gets told something else wants to go somewhere else because of the guys in front of him. I get that. That is why there is a transfer portal.”

With new NCAA limits in place the portal will remain open until Jan. 18 followed by a 15-day opening May 1-15 but the pace of exits has slowed from the initial rush after the regular season ended. Another group of defections might come after the bowl season.

Syracuse the Gophers’ opponent in the Pinstripe Bowl has had nine total departures including four from its depth chart with defensive backs Duce Chestnut and Ja’Had Carter being the biggest losses.

Meanwhile the number of college players pledging to new teams for 2023 has begun to increase with the early-signing period starting Wednesday. The Gophers have added two from Western Michigan — receiver Corey Crooms Jr. and linebacker Ryan Selig.

“We’ve benefited off the transfer portal” Fleck said Dec. 4. “We’ve got guys who have made a ton of plays for us this year that were from the transfer portal. Thank goodness we have the transfer portal.”

Minnesota and everyone else is still looking for additions via the portal to round out recruiting classes made up primarily of high school prospects. The Gophers have 17 high school players committed in the 2023 class and with a change in NCAA rules programs are no longer capped at only adding 25 newcomers but are still capped at 85 scholarships. With Crooms and Selig Minnesota has 19 total.

The Gophers will have a handful of prospects on campus this weekend including Charlotte transfer Elijah Stevens a 6-foot-1 split receiver who had 85 receptions for 1324 yards 15 touchdowns across two seasons. He was the Conference USA freshman of the year in 2021.

Minnesota has continued to put an emphasis on additions at wideout. That has remained evident since Wisconsin transfer Markus Allen backed out of his commitment to Minnesota to return to the Badgers on Dec. 7 and after Crooms committed last week.

This weekend Minnesota will welcome Southeastern Louisiana transfer Jack Henderson a 6-foot-3 205-pound slot cornerback who was first-team all-Southland Conference. Henderson had a team-high 90 tackles seven for lost yards two sacks two interceptions and two forced fumbles.

The pursuit of Henderson looks like a direct correlation to losing Dixon in the transfer portal.

“You’ve got to look at it as half full which we always do” Fleck said on the assessment of the portal. “We know that there is going to be that type of attrition for all the right reasons.”

With the portal remaining open until Jan. 18 the Gophers and other programs’ work in this space won’t conclude with the early-signing period next week. Last year Minnesota added seven total transfers with five committing from January to April.

The intra-Big Ten transfer portal movement has benefited Iowa the most adding Michigan quarterback Cade McNamara and Wolverines tight end Erick All.

The Gophers have been recruiting Iowa transfer cornerback Terry Roberts though Penn State seems like a favorite for Roberts while outgoing Gophers defensive end Austin Booker has visited his home-state Indiana Hoosiers.

Gophers defensive tackle Gage Keys has been courted by Virginia Tech and others while offensive lineman Cameron James has not been receiving the same level of interest from Power Five conference schools. Both Keys and Booker visited Kansas this weekend.

Cornerback Steven Ortiz Jr. came to Minnesota billed as a four-star recruit but he played in only one game. Fellow DB Jalen Glaze played in 27 games for Minnesota since 2020 but also has said goodbye. It’s unclear where they might end up next.

So not all transfers are created equal and on the whole the Gophers have had an average amount compared to its Big Ten West competitors since the portal opened two weeks ago.

Congress is on track in the coming week to give final approval to a national military budget for the current fiscal year that is expected to reach approximately $858 billion — or $45 billion above what President Biden had requested.

If approved at this level the Pentagon budget will have grown at 4.3 percent per year over the last two years — even after inflation — compared with an average of less than 1 percent a year in real dollars between 2015 and 2021 according to an analysis by Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments for The New York Times.

The FBI has joined the search for the youngster as police began digging up the parents' backyard to scour for evidence.

Madalina reportedly first went missing the day before Thanksgiving.

However police say Madalina's parents waited three weeks to visit their daughter's school to report that she had disappeared.

Cornelius Police announced on Thursday the same day she was reported missing they were opening an investigation into the girls' disappearance.

Cornelius Police were subsequently joined by investigators with the FBI and North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation.

Horrified neighbours watched on Friday as searches of the family home and backyard were carried out in hopes of finding evidence regarding Madalina's disappearance.

The next day Cornelius Police announced that Palmiter was arrested on a charge of failure to report the disappearance of a child to law enforcement.

Palmiter works as a mechanical designer at industrial machinery manufacturer Ingersoll Rand according to his LinkedIn profile.

Local resident Sydney Capps told WCCB: ""I’ve lived here my whole life so I’ve never seen anything like this.

""It’s odd that it seems like she went missing back in November and it’s just now being reported.""

Cornelius Police have not confirmed if they found anything of importance during their investigation.

However authorities did say they are still looking for her and are appealing to the public for information.

Police say Madalina is 4ft 10inches tall and weighs approximately 90 pounds and has brown eyes and brown.

The 11-year-old was last seen wearing jeans pink purple and white Adidas shoes a white t-shirt and a jacket.

Anyone with information concerning the whereabouts of Madalina Cojocari is urged to contact the Cornelius Police Department at (704) 892-7773.

Despite being a longtime Windows and Linux PC I've been skeptical of the mini PC market in general and have avoided making a purchase in the past. So much skepticism that my first introduction to this small form factor was last year's purchase of an Apple Mac Mini M1 despite not being a huge fan of the macOS operating system. Luckily this Beelink Mini PC has convinced me that ""small is better"" for Windows and Linux as well.

In reviewing the Beelink U59 Pro for its price with 16GB RAM Windows 11 pre-installed and running on an Intel 11th Generation Jasper Lake Processor is quite impressive. If other mini PCs deliver this much or more in such a small package the Windows and Linux Mini PC has as bright of a future as Apple's Mac Mini.

My purpose for buying a Mini PC

While I wanted a mini PC due to the small foot print that I could tuck away out of sight I of course had specific needs for this computer. First I wanted to make sure the mini PC was not only small but also quiet ran cool and could be operated 24 hours a day every day. I've read in some reviews where fan noise can be a problem for a number of mini PCs just like their big brother tower PCs but I'm quite happy to report that all is quiet with the Beelink U59. With fan noise minimal when it is on (I have to put my ear right next to the unit) I'm also happy to report the fan rarely is necessary as its processor the Intel N5105 is highly energy efficient and produces little heat itself. The only times I've had to restart this Mini PC is after a Windows update never and never because this little guy needed a break from running for so long.

Secondly I needed a mini PC that could play the role of a home media server for distributing Hi-Res music files to my AVRs stereo system and other streaming clients. While there are different software packages dedicated to hosting audio files (that's another article in itself) I've found that both Windows 10 and 11 have enough built-in DNLA features to meet my media streaming needs on my home network.

My final requirement was I needed the mini PC to simultaneously run a second application that that relayed files from my backyard weather station to various online weather data servers. I know weather station software is completely unrelated to media streaming software but this shows just how diverse in ways these small computers can be utilized. So what is this all about regarding a weather station? In a previous article I mentioned I own a Davis Instruments Vantage Pro2 Wireless Weather Station. For the past few years I've been using a very energy hungry and loud need-to-be-replaced PC running the WeatherLink software. I briefly considered bypassing the the PC all together and purchasing a WeatherLink Live hub capable of relaying the data to the servers without a Windows PC. But given the price of the 6100 Weather Live was near the same price as the Beelink U59 Pro it just made more sense to purchase the more capable and diverse in function Mini PC that I could use more for communicating just the weather just like I have.

My impressions of the Beelink U59 Pro Mini PC

For those interested in the Beelink U59 Pro I know you will want to use this mini PC for other purposes than the ones I listed above. As a Windows or Linux desktop it's pretty darn good. Don't let the small size fool you into thinking it is not capable of meeting most of your needs. The Beelink U59 Pro comes with the Intel N5105 processor that while a Celeron has 4 cores and fully supports Windows 11 requirements with a base frequency of 2.0 GHz capable of 2.9 GHz bursts. My particular unit was ordered with 16GB RAM and 500 GB of SSD storage. If you're needing more storage the good news is added storage up to 2TB SSD is possible internally. There are also plenty of ports available to you to expand via external devices including the four USB 3.0 ports and one USB Type-C port.

Included in the box I found the Beelink U59 Pro Mini PC a short and longer HDMI cable a Vesa mounting bracket a power supply and the obligated basic setup manual. My only complaint with what's included in the box is the length of the electric cord from power supply to PC is REALLY short. You'll find that this PC will need to be positioned much closer to an electrical outlet or power strip than you might like. If Beelink could have provided a long power chord with this unit it would go a long way toward customer satisfaction.

Back view of the Beelink U59 Pro



With Mini PCs there seems to be an interest from YouTube reviewers to review the unit's gaming capability. Running on Windows 11 this Beelink U59 runs surprisingly faster than my older gaming PC but admittedly I own a very old PC. However due to the graphics card limitations on the Beelink it's difficult to recommend this Mini PC for extremely intensive video game usage. However this PC would be a great addition for those needing to support office or school applications as well as general home computing needs. What may also surprise you is you can also connect up to three displays with its two HDMI ports and and single USB-C port. However I've read some literature that if you're using 4K monitors you may be limited to just two monitors. I haven't connected to more than two monitors so could not verify how well the Beelink U59 Pro works with three monitors.

As a whole there isn't much you can improve in this Celeron-based Mini PC such as this as it's near-perfect for my uses. I have no regrets in my purchase and except for those that want to use the Mini PC for intense modern gaming I would also recommend this mini PC to any user needing a PC on the cheap. The Mini PC is available on Amazon usually at a starting price of $269 but often coupons and available and sales are possible to lower the price of this the Beelink U59 Pro.

Steve Orrin works with government agencies to provide practical guidance and approaches to mission needs including cybersecurity and supply chain risk management. By helping agencies adopt and scale trustworthy software supply chains Orrin advises government organizations to address these critical needs.

Why Watch

One of Orrin’s current projects involves advising a customer on the development of resilient edge computing and communications operations in contested distributed edge environments. His team uses advanced technologies to ensure government clients have strong security controls for their edge-to-cloud environments.

Orrin said his personal motto is “Surround yourself with people who are smarter than you and listen to their feedback.”

“I have the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse team that works across multiple domains to help the federal government adopt today’s technology and plan for the future” he added. “Our team advises and helps to deploy a range of technology solutions ⏤ from AI and cyber to edge and high-performance computing.”

Orrin is a “trusted advisor for many government agencies on how to solve complex cybersecurity issues and comply with regulations” said Jim Brinker president and general manager of Intel Federal.

“He takes the most significant mission challenges and applies novel and innovative approaches to solve them with technology from Intel and our ecosystem partners” Brinker added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob3Jvbml4LmNvbS9uZXdzL1RvcnZhbGRzLUJhc2hlcy1JbnRlbC1MQU3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Linus Torvalds Bashes Intel's LAM - Rejected For Linux 6.2,"Linus Torvalds can be known for his hardware commentary at times like hoping AVX-512 ""dies a painful death"" Intel's ""bad policies"" around ECC memory  and giving NVIDIA the finger . The latest colorful commentary by the Linux creator is around Intel's new Linear Address Masking (LAM) feature that aimed to land in Linux 6.2 but is now delayed until the code can be reworked. Linear Address Masking is a feature Intel originally detailed in 2020 and their engineers have been working on the Linux kernel enablement since and had sent it in for merging with Linux 6.2 albeit that is no longer happening.



Intel PRM documentation on this new hardware feature has been available since 2020.

Christ.



Is it too late to ask Intel to call this ""Top-Bits-Ignore"" and instead of adding another crazy TLA [Three Letter Acronym] we'd just all agree to call this ""TBI""?



I know I know NIH and all that but at least as long as we are limiting ourselves to regular US-ASCII we really only have 17576 TLA's to go around and at some point it gets not only confusing but really quite wasteful to have everybody make up their own architecture-specific TLA.



And while I'm on the subject: I really think that the changes to ""untagged_addr()"" are fundamentally broken.



Why? That whole LAM (or BTI) is not necessarily per-mm. It can easily be per-*thread*.



Imagine if you will a setup where you have some threads that use tagged pointers and some threads that don't.



For example maybe the upper bits of the address contains a tag that is used only used within a virtual machine? You could even have the ""native"" mode use the full address space and put itself and its private data in the upper bits virtually.



[In other words] imagine using the virtual address masking as not just memory sanitizers but as an actual honest-to-goodness separation feature (eg JITed code might fundamentally have access only to the lower bits while the JITter itself sees the whole address space).



Maybe that's not how LAM works on x86 but your changes to untagged_addr() are *not* x86-specific.



So I really think this is completely wrong quite aside from the naming. It just makes assumptions that aren't valid.



The fact that you made this mm-specific actually ends up being an active bug in the code even on x86-64. You use the mmap lock to serialize this all in prctl_enable_tagged_addr() but then the read side (ie just untagged_addr()) isn't actually serialized at all - and *shouldn't* be serialized.



So I really think this is a fundamental design mistake and while I pulled it and sorted out the trivial conflicts I've unpulled it again as being actively mis-designed.

Simply put Intel LAM is about using the untranslated address bits of user-space addresses so it can be used for metadata. LAM can be used for a variety of purposes with the metadata like user-space memory sanitizers and tagging and is similar in nature to AMD's Upper Address Ignore ""UAI"" with Zen 4 and Arm's Top Byte Ignore ""TBI"" features. It's believed that LAM will first be found in Intel Sapphire Rapids processors.Linus Torvalds isn't happy though with the Linux LAM kernel implementation and even the name The LAM kernel enablement was sent in as part of the x86/mm changes for Linux 6.2 . But in response to that Torvalds wrote A Linux kernel mailing list discussion then ensued over possible design changes to how Intel's Linear Address Masking is implemented for the Linux. But long story short Torvalds views the Intel LAM code as not ready for Linux and didn't end up pulling the code. It's over the software enablement that strikes the wrong chord with him and not the hardware feature itself.



Intel LAM isn't landing for Linux 6.2 with Torvalds being unhappy over the kernel implementation and is of the opinion that some of the kernel changes for supporting it are ""fundamentally broken""... In an ideal world he'd also prefer it be re-branded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9jb3JlLWk1LTEzNDAwLWV4aGliaXRzLWNvcmUtaTUtMTI2MDBrLWxpa2UtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtZm9yLWFyb3VuZC1kb2xsYXIyNDDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Core i5-13400 Exhibits Core i5-12600K-Like Performance For Around $240,"Intel's Raptor Lake non-K processors won't be out until 2023.

The recipe will sound familiar because it's the same design as Intel's last-generation Core i5-12600K Alder Lake part one of the best CPUs. The reason is that some of Intel's Raptor Lake chips will use rewarmed Alder Lake C0 or H0 dies. This strategy effectively allows Intel to recycle leftover Alder Lake silicon and bring its E-cores down to the latest Core i5 non-K SKUs which previously lacked E-cores back on Alder Lake. The bad news is that these processors will have Golden Cove cores instead of the newer Raptor Cove cores. We haven't been able to confirm which Raptor Lake non-K chips carry the Alder Lake silicon but by the looks of it the Core i5-13400 is in all likelihood one of them.

The Core i5-13400 also retains the same L2 cache (9.5MB) and L3 cache (20MB) as the Core i5-12600K. In terms of clock speeds the Core i5-13400 has a 4.1 GHz P-core base clock and a 3.3 GHz E-core boost clock. Therefore the Raptor Lake chip flaunts an 11% higher P-core base clock and 18% higher E-core base clock than the Core i5-12600K. Naturally the Core i5-13400 doesn't have a higher boost clock than the Core i5-12600K since the first is a 65W chip whereas the latter is a 125W-class part. Nonetheless the Core i5-13400 has a 4.6 GHz boost clock speed which is not too shabby for a 65W processor.

The Core i5-13400F shares identical specifications as the Core i5-13400 albeit offering the same level of performance. The only difference is that the Core i5-13400F lacks the integrated Intel UHD Graphics 730 engine. Therefore the Core i5-13400F comes with a slightly lower price tag than the Core i5-13400.

Intel Core i5-13400F Core i5 -13400 Benchmarks

Swipe to scroll horizontally Processor Cinebench R23 Multi-Core Cinebench R23 Single-Core Blender (BMW27) Adobe Premiere (Puget Systems) Adobe Photoshop (Puget Systems) Core i5-13400 Core i5-13400F 15255 1767 155 1166 870 Core i5-12600K 17060 1866 148 1193 901

The Core i5-12600K scored 12% higher than the Core i5-13400 in Cinebench R23's single-core test and 6% higher in the multi-core test. In addition the Alder Lake part was 5% faster than the Raptor Lake chip in Blender with the BMW27 scene. However the Core i5-12600K's advantage over the Core i5-13400 wasn't significant in other real-world workloads. For example the Core i5-12600K only outperformed the Core i5-13400 by 2% in Adobe Premiere. Furthermore it delivered only 4% higher performance in Adobe Photoshop.

Overall the Core i5-12600K was marginally better than the Core i5-13400 in many benchmarks except for the single-core test in Cinebench R23 where the Alder Lake chip posted a 12% difference. Nevertheless the Core i5-13400 results were good considering that it's a 65W processor competing against a 125W one. Note that the 65W is the Processor Base Power (PBP) value. Nguyen Cong Computer highlighted that the Core i5-13400 pulled up to 140W but believes that more optimized firmware will likely reduce the power consumption. For reference the Core i5-12600K has a 150W Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) rating.

Although Nguyen Cong Computer has listed the Core i5-13400 and Core i5-13400F on its online store the retailer didn't reveal the pricing. However hardware detective momomo_us has found both chips at PC Canada. The Core i5-13400 sells for $239.37 (328.99 CAD) whereas the Core i5-13400F retails for $212.44 (291.99 CAD). Of course computer hardware is a bit more expensive in Canada so the actual price tags for the Core i5-13400 and Core i5-13400F will probably be lower in the U.S."

On Thursday morning Lanvin Group executives board members shareholders and business partners lingered on the New York Stock Exchange trading room floor following the ceremonial ringing of the bell announcing the company’s public status achieved through a SPAC listing. As they watched the stock price inch up — reaching $22.81 an increase of more than 130% at one point — excitement was in the air.

That was even as red text dominated surrounding screens and reporters’ phones lit up with notifications from news sources citing the DOW’s fall by more than 300 points. It eventually closed out its worst day in three months.

But Lanvin Group and co. held hope that the company would hold up as an exception on many counts.

Seeing the stock hit the +30% mark early on fueled buzz: One executive pointed out that Zegna the last fashion company to go public in December 2021 closed its first day of trading up just 4.2%. Another noted that “the SPAC market has been terrible for the last six months” and that “most SPACs have entered the market at 80% down.” One worker said the milestone moment of launching on the NYSE on a high note served to stamp the Group’s positioning as the “biggest luxury conglomerate to come out of Asia.” Joann Cheng Lanvin Group chairman and CEO later stressed to Glossy that Lanvin Group is not an Asian company but rather a global company regardless of its Shanghai headquarters. China only accounts for 10% of the Group’s revenue.

But attention around the state of the $10 stock soured by the day’s end with shares closing at $7.37 or down around 26%. It wasn’t surprising solely based on the market’s recently erratic state. By Friday the stock had rebounded to $10.

Cheng’s leadership was arguably proven on Thursday sticking to a “let’s-wait-and-see” response throughout early interviews and a press conference involving questions about the stock’s early traction. And she exuded confidence when drilled about the current state of Lanvin Group’s brands and their direction from here.

Lanvin Group known as Fosun Fashion Group until October 2021 owns French couture house Lanvin American luxury company St. John Austrian hosiery company Wolford and Italian brands Sergio Rossi and Caruso the latter of which specializes in men’s suiting. It acquired footwear brand Sergio Rossi in 2021. Together the brands are expected to do about $425 million in sales this year.

The main ideas in Lanvin Group’s post-IPO plans are expanding its brands’ retail footprints elevating their digital presences and entering them into new product categories. Cheng said ready-to-wear-focused Lanvin will set its sights on shoes and leather goods for example. In addition she called the U.S. and China “low-hanging fruit” for the Group’s brands considering the amount of business both markets have driven for competitors while only making up a low-double-digit percentage of the company’s total sales.

Earlier this year Lanvin Group revealed a goal of becoming profitable by 2024.

Rather than immediate gains for Lanvin Group investors Cheng set expectations around longer-term growth fueled by increased operational strength and the brands’ established equity. Investment in the Group’s current portfolio is the priority she said. Additional brand acquisitions are of interest if the company is positioned to go there.

“We are not a short-sighted management team that wants to drive short-term value” Cheng told Glossy.

In a meeting room preceding a noon press conference David Chan Lanvin Group executive president and co-COO described the company as “lucky” and “fortunate” as he listed recent positive news developments for fashion brands particularly those targeting Asian consumers. Among them were the retirement of China’s zero-tolerance Covid policy the “easing” of the U.S.’s Consumer Price Index and the signed agreement between the U.S. PCAOB and Chinese authorities.

Regardless of economic changes Lanvin Group’s established roadmap will remain intact Cheng said. On the same note she was sure to state that the “IPO is not a purpose” of the company but rather a milestone allowing it to stay its course.



Along with Lanvin Group launching on the NYSE under the ticker LANV Thursday marked the company’s merger with the Primavera Capital Acquisition Corporation SPAC and a raise of more than $150 million in fresh capital. “It’s enough for us to operate the brands until our profitability” Cheng said. She also shared that a majority shareholder had converted a loan into equity making Lanvin Group debt-free.

Cheng took on the role of Lanvin Group CEO in 2018 following the acquisition of Lanvin by Fosun Fashion Group. It was a smooth transition from her leadership position at parent company Fosun International an international investment conglomerate. Before working for Fosun she held positions in accounting and finance.

Of course a firm plan isn’t always the right plan. And while Cheng has a clear vision for growing Lanvin Group and strengthening its luxury positioning its effectiveness remains to be seen. In talking with the Group’s various brand leaders it was clear that they’re along for the ride. But it was also apparent that they’re entering new territory. Bets are being made and there’s much work to be done.

Wolford co-CEOs Silvia Azzali and Paul Kotrba both admitted that hosiery Wolford’s specialty is “not a big growth category.” As such it’s leaning into leggings launched as part of a new athleisure offering in 2020. According to Azzali leggings are a part of Wolford’s DNA as women’s legs are the company’s expertise. But while they’re “selling very well” she said and something new for the company they’re not a new concept for consumers.

Along the same lines St. John deputy CEO Andy Lew addressed the fact that his company is known for women’s power suiting at a time when a business formal uniform has fallen out of fashion. To balance out its product assortment St. John introduced a line in November called the Foundation. Its focus is everyday wardrobe essentials that can be mixed and matched with dressier pieces. Denim T-shirts and even a jean jacket are among included pieces ranging in price from $200-$1900.

For its part Caruso has benefitted from being unpopular in the traditional sense CEO Marco Angeloni seemed to say. The company’s spent “zero” in communications and marketing in the last few years as “word of mouth” through the buyers and sales associates at its 200 specialty retail partners have worked to drive sales. Its biggest markets based on revenue are the highly competitive Italy and Japan. “We’re men’s best-kept secret” Angeloni said.

While Lanvin Group brands’ equity and DNAs are strong as noted by Cheng providing newness is sure to become more important for them particularly as the Group goes after Chinese consumers known for their love of novelty.

The Lanvin brand is already making good progress on that front.

“The work has begun in reframing the product repositioning the brand in the global marketplace and poising it for the kind of growth it deserves” said Siddhartha Shukla deputy gm of Lanvin.

The brand is relocating its Madison Avenue flagship in April simultaneously introducing a larger more focused “boutique” store concept. Lanvin’s Rodeo Drive store will be refreshed with the concept by early 2024 followed by others. In addition the brand has plans to expand its retail footprint in the U.S. Shukla said. It currently has seven stores in the states and 27 worldwide.

Cheng hinted that attracting bigger-name creative directors to Lanvin Group brands is a goal. “[Going public] will get us more exposure … which will help us recruit talent” she said.

For one Lanvin creative director Bruno Sialelli is relatively unknown. As the Financial Times noted in 2021 the Lanvin brand reported revenue of €73 million just one-third of its sales when Alber Elbaz was creative director in 2011.

In the immediate future St. John and Sergio Rossi have plans to lean on celebrities and edgier brands to drive buzz. Robert Muzingo St. John’s head of e-commerce and online marketing said St. John’s spring campaign will focus on values with screenwriter Shonda Rhimes as the face. In February 70-year-old Sergio Rossi will have a presence at Area NYC’s fashion week show which will showcase the brands’ collaboration according to Sergio Rossi CEO Riccardo Sciutto.

Overall Lanvin Group brands are preparing to hit the gas — but they’ll do so responsibly Shukla stressed. How they’ll fair remains unclear — but the same can be said of any fashion brand in the current landscape.

NASDAQ stocks are stocks listed on stock exchange named 'The Nasdaq Stock Market' which is also commonly just known as the Nasdaq.

In terms of the Nasdaq it is the largest U.S. equities exchange by volume and also the first electronic stock exchange in the world given its founding in 1971. As an electronic stock exchange the Nasdaq has no psychical trading floors and is instead built on an automated network of computers that match buy and sell orders.

By being fully electronic there is potential for the Nasdaq to be faster than its main competitor The New York Stock Exchange which has a hybrid system that includes both an electronic trading network and a physical trading floor.

As an electronic only stock exchange it is perhaps more fitting that the Nasdaq is home to many big tech companies such as Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) whose stocks are listed on the exchange.

Given the growth of the technology industry in the last three decades the market capitalization of some of the stocks listed on the Nasdaq has increased substantially.

2022

Given high inflation in 2022 the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year. As a result of the interest rate increases Treasury yields have increased substantially and capital has moved from the tech sector into U.S. government bonds as a result.

As a result of the capital outflow the valuations of many growth companies and big tech companies listed on the Nasdaq have decreased.

The Nasdaq Composite which is a market capitalization weighted stock market index that includes nearly all of the stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange has decreased substantially as a result.

Given the decrease some leading blue chip stocks listed on the Nasdaq arguably trade below their intrinsic values which make them potentially 'cheap' stocks.

Given the uncertainty it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors however.

Captain Jan Zuniga of the Salvation Army had nothing but gratitude for those who gathered to volunteer their time to support children in Orange County this holiday season.

“Making Christmas happen for 500 kids does not happen without the community and so for me this is Christmas morning” she said. “I think there’s about 30 volunteers here on this morning to help make sure this process is moving. This is Christmas to me; that’s what this is.”

The process described by Zuniga was the service project that occurred on the morning of Dec. 10 at the Salvation Army building on 1950 MLK in Orange.

Thirty volunteers met at 8 a.m. in advance of Wednesday’s Angel Tree distribution to organize the gymnasium full of gifts for more than 200 families and 500 children in Orange County.

As Christmas music played the Salvation Army “army behind the Army” organized sorted and prepared Christmas gifts to ensure a streamlined distribution for families on Wednesday.

The Angel Tree program provides Christmas gifts for children in Orange County ages 12 and under.

According to Zuniga the annual program hosted by the Orange Corps is made possible by local community members and partners in government industry and church congregations.

In Orange County a few communities partner were International Paper First United Methodist Church and Lamar State College Orange who committed to 175 and 40 angel tree tags respectively.

Brad Childs Orange City council member of District 2 is another community partner. His business Childs Building Supply-Ace Hardware donated the bags used to package Angel Tree gifts.

The Salvation Army is a United Way of Orange County partner agency. They receive funds guidance support and resources from UWOC.

During their August campaign kickoff breakfast UWOC president and CEO Maureen McAllister described partner agencies.

“These partner agencies are the boots on the ground every single day out there doing the work to help make an impact in people’s lives” McAllister said.

And on Saturday morning McAllister along with UWOC volunteers were those boots on the ground working diligently.

International Paper the largest pulp and paper company in the world was also on hand to volunteer. Representatives from their Orange location the Orange Containerboard Mill were well represented among the volunteers.

Other volunteers included students from Little Cypress-Mauriceville High School missionaries serving Orange County county employees and several families who brought their children to help.

The Angel Tree works to ensure that every child registered receives at least one new toy for Christmas.

In addition to toys the program also provides bedding coats apparel diapers and more to ensure the human needs of children in Orange County are met.

Additionally the red kettle campaign continues virtually and in person in support of their goal to raise $65000 over a span of 11 locations. Red Kettle campaign funds add to the operating budget for the upcoming year and assist with seasoning programming.

However as much as consumers said they wanted to shop small growing concerns about the possibility of product shortages higher shipping costs and longer delivery times posed a serious threat.

Still despite fear of losing customers to large traditional retailers as the holiday shopping season comes to a close new data from Intuit QuickBooks finds that consumers are holding true on their intent to shop small.

More from WWD

Shilpa Reddy vice president and general manager of the QuickBooks commerce segment at Intuit said the company’s research found that at the top of the holiday shopping season more than 80 percent of consumers planned to maintain or increase spending at small businesses throughout the holiday season with consumers planning to spend 40 percent of their total holiday budgets at small businesses.

“It’s an $88 billion opportunity” Reddy said and a “clear indication that consumers are eager to keep small businesses thriving while sourcing unique gifts for their loved ones this season. This [holiday was] also a great opportunity for small businesses nationwide to connect with their local community and generate the revenue that they need.”

Shilpa Reddy vice president and general manager of the QuickBooks commerce segment at Intuit.

Moreover in comparing this holiday season to recent years Reddy told WWD that consumer support has remained largely consistent.

“At the onset of the pandemic we saw a surge of support for small businesses to help them weather the storm” Reddy said. “This support has been consistent since then as consumers continue to make a prolonged effort to keep their favorite businesses from shuttering. While inflation is having an impact on spending this year specifically consumers still feel compelled to allocate budget toward shopping small.”

With rising costs in mind the company’s recent survey notably uncovered insights into exactly why consumers were planning to spend more with small businesses during the holidays this year. In its survey Intuit found more than half of the consumers surveyed reporting that they like to support the local economy while 47 percent said they wanted to keep small businesses alive and would miss them if they had to close down.

“We’ve also seen that there is interest from consumers in unique gifts and they turn to their favorite local businesses to find them” Reddy said. “Another recent report found that 68 percent of American consumers say they prefer to buy unique holiday gifts from small businesses.”

One small business that Reddy said she has seen be particularly successful in connecting with consumers during this time is Grace+Love Candle Co. founded by Jamahl and Natalie Grace.

“Grace+Love Candle Co. prepared early for the holiday season by leaning into market research analyzing their own data from past seasons and stocking up on inventory in advance” Reddy said. “Using QuickBooks to manage their finances Jamahl and Natalie looked at past years and current trends and projected that as much as 30 to 40 percent of their annual revenue would come from holiday sales. Understanding how crucial the holidays and ‘candle season’ would be to their success Grace+Love Candle Co. proudly participated in Black Friday Cyber Monday and Small Business Saturday this year helping them engage consumers during the biggest shopping days of the year.”

According to Natalie and Jamahl being able to excite existing customers as well as engage new ones through these promotions was essential to success.

With 2023 approaching quickly Reddy shared several strategies that small business owners can tap into to help keep their momentum going.

First small businesses should consider that “having an omnichannel presence has never been more important as small businesses need to meet customers where they are. Ninety-seven percent of consumers reported they prefer to shop both in-person and online.”

When establishing an omnichannel strategy Reddy further advised small businesses to look beyond their own website for opportunities to reach customers. This can include online marketplaces like Amazon eBay and Etsy or even social platforms with commerce capabilities like Facebook and Instagram. At the same time digital-only businesses should consider finding moments to join in-person sales events such as festivals community pop-ups and farmer’s markets.

Second Reddy said small businesses need to be sure to regularly update customers about what items are in stock. Given supply chain challenges consumers need to know what is available from a store to help avoid frustration during their shopping experience.

Last she said businesses should consider offering deals to attract new and existing customers to come to their stores. Also important is to look for ways of streamlining the overall shopping experience for customers once they are there.

Whenever possible offering discounts or in-store experiences to drive sales will be important she said as inflation is making customers more price-sensitive. The company’s research found that 80 percent of consumers will cut spending if the economy continues to worsen. Consumers say they will spend more with small businesses that offer holiday promotions and discounts as well as fast affordable shipping options and quick and easy checkouts.

Overall Reddy was positive about the outlook for small businesses saying that while this year has brought about its own unique set of challenges from inflation to supply chain issues to the ongoing pandemic “one thing that has remained constant is the resilience of small businesses and the enthusiasm from consumers to support them.”

But the key to seeing survival rates rise is early detection giving people a fighting chance to fight back.

While life-saving an early finding can feel impossible since many cancers don’t present as systematic until later stages — by then devastatingly decreasing a person’s survival rate.

Nevertheless medical staff at Banner Health’s MD Anderson Cancer Center located at North Colorado Medical Center (NCMC) in Greeley is dedicated to catching certain types of cancers early and having one-of-a-kind technology in the region that makes diagnosis and treatment easier for all.

Dr. Jason Tcheng a thoracic surgical oncologist at MD Anderson handles anything cancer-related in the chest and gut. He vouches for the program saying it recognizes the importance of early detection specifically for lung cancer. That is why Banner Health has pushed for a lung cancer screening program in the past few years.

“What we’ve learned over the last decade or so is that we have been behind the eight ball on catching lung cancer early” Tcheng said. “We are losing options for patients when we get them with later stages.”

As December marks National Lung Cancer Awareness Month Banner Health’s efforts and technology showcase the options available nowadays for cancer patients including the ability to perform minimally invasive lung surgery and more opportunities to cure rather than treat cancer.

Screenings save lives

The lung cancer screening program provides a low-dose CT scan for patients who qualify. A person must meet certain criteria — adults ages 50 to 80 years who have a 20-pack-year smoking history currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years — to receive a screening. Most patients are identified and referred to the MD Anderson program via primary care physicians according to Tcheng.

Tcheng said this type of program is needed to see life-saving changes in the world of lung cancer since an early diagnosis is hard to catch due to lung cancer typically not showing any symptoms in the early stages.

Once symptoms of lung cancer — such as pneumonia with a cough coughing up blood or chest pain — become visible most people are already in the late stages.

“It’s going to catch these patients that are going about their daily business and actually feeling great and unfortunately may have something brewing” Tcheng said about the screening.

The different stages of lung cancer’s five-year survival rates:

Stage 1A1 to 1A3: 80-90% survival rate.

Stage 2A to 2B: 60-70% survival rate.

Stage 3A to 3C: 14-35% survival rate.

Stage 4: Less than 10% survival rate.

Tcheng reassured a vast majority of those who qualify for the program are in the clear for cancer but pulmonary nodules have shown up on a handful of patients’ screenings and a fair amount of those people end up receiving a lung cancer diagnosis.

“These patients are being treated earlier and have a better survival have better outcomes overall” he said. So that is what we’re trying to accomplish here at NCMC is to create a program where these patients have easy access and a streamlined process to go through so that they can get identified diagnosed and treated.”

Treatment improvements

Staging is an important aspect when identifying lung cancer because it’s how doctors proceed with options to give patients the best possible outcome despite how advanced the stage is Tcheng explained.

He said a majority of those in stage one are treated with surgery alone — another reason to catch lung cancer in its early stages. Surgery is an ideal option since many patients come in hoping to avoid experiencing chemotherapy or radiation.

Going into stage two Tcheng said there are new systemic therapies called immunotherapy that help reduce the amount of chemotherapy and burden. In stage three that’s where the bulk of the treatment includes radiation or chemotherapy and rarely surgery. While stage four is generally palliative or supportive treatment and some chemotherapy.

Fortunately prompt treatment after a lung cancer diagnosis has become a lot more accessible and convenient because of new technology at MD Anderson Tcheng said highlighting the ION.

The ION is a robotic navigational bronchoscopy system — offered nowhere else in northern Colorado — that allows patients to experience a one-stop-shop of diagnosis and treatment with resection all at the same time.

The technology is minimally invasive with less room for error than other current and widely used technology according to Tcheng. The robotic system enables doctors to go after smaller nodules with more precision higher yield and better diagnoses. It also gives doctors an opportunity to reach former unreachable nodules and can reach nodules on both sides of the lung.

“It’s integrated into our robotic system so that if something is diagnosed with that system we can treat it with surgical resection that same day under the same anesthetic event” he said.

Tcheng said many of Banner Health’s patients are from rural parts of Weld County meaning they have to travel a few hours to MD Anderson which is why the staff was compelled by the robotic system. The one-stop-shop eliminating traveling back and forth as well as waiting long periods of time between a diagnosis and treatment make for happier patients he said.

“The whole gamut it’s an inclusive one-stop-shop kind of deal for cancer care and that’s not just lung cancer” Tcheng said. That’s breast cancer colon cancer that includes gynec melanoma those kinds of things.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The game was the fourth this season that the Wildcats were playing against a nationally-ranked opponent and the Cyclones were the second top-15 foe on the Villanova schedule through the first seven weeks of the 2022-23 season.Senior forwardled the Wildcats with 32 points 11 rebounds and four blocks on the day. Siegrist has topped 20 points in all 12 games this season and has 63 career 20-point games to her credit. She also notched her 42career double-double and fifth this season while surpassing the 30-point plateau for the fourth time this year and the 21time in her collegiate career.Siegrist and sophomore point guardeach scored in double figures and combined to make four of Villanova's five three-point field goals in the game. Olsen finished the game with 14 points and has now scored in double figures in four straight games.An early run by Iowa State gave the Wildcats an uphill battle to climb for much of the opening 20 minutes. Olsen drilled a three-pointer with 4:58 to play in the first quarter which had Villanova down by just a single point at 11-10 but the Wildcats made just one basket over nearly seven minutes as the Cyclones used a 15-2 spurt to stretch the margin to 26-12 with 8:36 remaining in the second period.Junior guardsnapped the Iowa State run with her first basket of the game with 8:19 to play in the period and Olsen made another three-pointer at the 7:29 mark of the period to trim the deficit to 26-17. Later in the period the Cyclones pulled away with a 13-4 run over the final 5:23 of the half to take a 42-23 lead into halftime.""As expected it was a tough game"" Villanova head coachsaid. ""Iowa State showed why they are one of the top teams in the country; they showed us that in the first half. I was pleased with our effort and the way we battled to the end in the second half especially.""Villanova got back into the game with a long run to open the third quarter. Siegrist and Olsen combined to go 6-for-6 at the free throw line in the opening five minutes of the period after the Wildcats did not have a single free throw attempt in the first half. Two foul shots by Siegrist with 5:04 to play in the quarter pulled Villanova to within 11 points at 42-31 and the Wildcats defense held Iowa State scoreless until the 3:27 mark of the period. Villanova would eventually cut the margin to 10 points (47-37) with 1:31 left in the third quarter before the Cyclones scored five unanswered points to close the period.Early in the game the Wildcats defense led by Siegrist and sophomore forwardkept Iowa State from getting into an offensive groove. Villanova had a season-high nine blocked shots on the day including the four by Siegrist and three from Dalce. Six of those blocks came in the first 14 minutes of the game alone and the Wildcats held Cyclones leading scorer Ashley Joens to nine points on 3-of-10 shooting in the first 20 minutes of the contest.Joens (2562) and Siegrist (2148) are ranked first and third among all active Division I players in career scoring and the pair have combined for 4710 career points. They each had nine points at halftime of Sunday's contest before Siegrist poured in 23 points in the second 20 minutes. She was 5-of-11 from the field and 12-of-13 from the foul line in the second half.""Maddy was as advertised if not better"" Iowa State head coach Bill Fennelly said. ""I have coached against a lot of great players and I don't like to say the best but she's on the list. It's incredible the way she moves and the things they run. She is also a lot better defensive player than she looked on video. I loved her game and everything about it. Kudos to her and the coaching staff because she just kept competing.""Villanova returns home this coming Wednesday at 11:30 a.m. against Big 5 foe La Salle.Sunday's game was the first ever meeting between Villanova and Iowa State … The Cyclones are the second nationally-ranked Big 12 opponent the Wildcats faced this year … Villanova also took on then-No. 21 Baylor at the Gulf Coast Showcase last month … The Wildcats are 3-3 all-time at Mohegan Sun Arena … Villanova is 2-2 in neutral site games this year … Siegrist moved past Courtney Mix into third place on the Wildcats all-time rebounding list with 876 career rebounds … Villanova has made at least one three-pointer in 593 straight games.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTcvdGhlLWludmVzY28tcXFxLXRydXN0LWlzLWNoYW5naW5nLWl0cy1ob2xkaW5ncy1oZXJlcy13aGF0cy1uZXcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Invesco QQQ Trust is changing its holdings. Here's what's new,"The index behind one of the biggest ETFs on the market is getting a shakeup next week creating a shift in the portfolios of many investors. The Nasdaq-100 which consists of roughly 100 of the largest non-financial companies that trade on the Nasdaq stock market is about to change. The index is rebalanced once a year by Nasdaq and this year is adding six new stocks while removing seven. The new lineup — which fluctuates around 100 stocks but isn't pegged to exactly that number — takes effect on Monday. The index is the backbone of the Invesco QQQ Trust  one of the biggest ETFs on the market with more than $150 billion in assets under management. Investors who own the QQQ will see their own portfolios indirectly change as the massive fund rotates its holdings. Because the stocks listed on the Nasdaq are generally tilted toward technology the QQQ ETF is sometimes used as a shorthand for the performance of the tech sector. However that will be less true in 2023. While all seven stocks leaving the index could broadly be considered tech companies the new additions include two oil names in Diamondback Energy and Baker Hughes  the latter of which transferred to the Nasdaq in December from the New York Stock Exchange. Real estate analytics firm CoStar Group and media company Warner Bros. Discovery are also not perfect fits within the tech sector. ""That's probably the biggest takeaway is that we're gaining a little bit of energy exposure. I think at the end of the day when you're looking at the index however the lion's share of sector representation is going to made up of information technology [communications] services and consumer discretionary — very similar to where it stands today"" said Ryan McCormack senior factor and core equity ETF strategist at Invesco. Adding a little more diversity to the fund may not be a bad thing for investors. The QQQ has dropped more than 30% this year. Some of the stocks being removed from the fund have performed even worse with DocuSign and Match Group each sliding more than 60%. Meanwhile both energy names joining the index are comfortably in the black for the year and GlobalFoundries has outperformed the semiconductor industry. Falling out of the index and the ETF is not necessarily a sign that these stocks are due for a long-term decline. McCormack said that since December 2010 the median 1-year return of companies that fell out of the Nasdaq-100 is roughly 10.5% and 18 of those stocks have moved back into the Nasdaq-100 later. The Invesco QQQ Trust which was launched in 1999 has an expense ratio of 0.20%.",,,,,,,,,

Kent,"Norma Jean Kent 92 passed away peacefully on Sunday December 18 2022 under Interim Hospice care at Wausau Manor.

She was born on April 21 1930 to Edward and Selma (Roell) Graefe in Iron Mountain Mich where Norma spent her early childhood years before attending college.

In 1954 Norma graduated from Augustana University in Rock Island Ill. with a bachelor’s degree in nursing. She would go on to have an outstanding 37-year career as a nurse. During her career she held the title of Orthopedic Unit Nursing Director at Wausau Hospital (Aspirus). Over the course of her career she held nursing licenses in both Illinois and Wisconsin. When she retired Norma prided herself on keeping in touch with her nursing friends and coworkers.

She married Edward “Ed” Kent on October 3 1953. The two were each other’s lifelong companions who enjoyed traveling. Together they had three children: Dave Rick and Jon. They would continue to travel with many trips to Montana throughout the mid-west and to the east coast. Their annual trip to Williamsport Penn. to attend the Little League World Series was always one of her favorites in addition to their many casino trips. Their best trip was in 2003 where they took their entire family to Disneyland to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.

Norma was an avid gardener who enjoyed tending to her backyard flower garden on the hill and a tremendous cook who served up the best pasty pies. Norma was also a devoted sports fan. She supported her children and then her grandchildren at all events from little league through high school athletics. In her spare time she would then enjoy cheering on the Chicago Cubs and Green Bay Packers.

Survivors include her children David (Pat) Rick (Lisa) and Jon; grandchildren Kelcee Ryder (Becky) Ryan Ricky (Tenley); great-grandchildren Trey Grant and Reid.

She was preceded in death by her parents and husband Edward who passed away on November 23 2015.

The family would like to thank Interim Hospice Care & Wausau Manor for their kind compassionate care and the staff at Copperleaf Assisted Living (Schofield) for the dedicated care provided to our mother and grandmother over the past 2-1/2 years.

Memorial services will be at noon on Tuesday December 27 2022 at Memorial Chapel Mausoleum Restlawn Memorial Park Wausau. Visitation will be Tuesday from 11:00 a.m. until the time of the service.

So he makes a little extra money by putting in appearances at corporate events private parties photo sessions and even parades.

These keep the jolly old elf busy. Fortunately he has lots of helpers many in Arkansas willing to take on the role of Santa and bring joy to children of all ages throughout the holidays.

Santa Craig of Conway is one them. Also known as both Craig Imboden and Conway Santa Santa Craig says he came by the role naturally.

Born five days before Christmas at what was then St. Vincent Infirmary in Little Rock Santa Craig said he “was one of the few babies who went home that year in a stocking.” His parents always put out a huge Christmas display. Sometimes 15 or 20 cars would line up on the road as people came to look at the lights.

“My dad was kind of famous in Conway for that for a long time” Santa Craig said.

One night there was a knock at their door he said and it was Santa.

“He said ‘I was flying through the area and saw your beautiful light display and I just wanted to come and wish you a merry Christmas’” he said.

Santa Craig has been a professional Santa for 19 years now.

“In my book a professional Santa is someone who dedicates their life to the season” he said.

Although the Imbodens have a family business in Conway Santa Craig said he does something related to Christmas every day including crafting props for other Santas.

Santa Craig didn’t want to divulge his prices because they fluctuate with the type of event and particularly with the timing of it. But an average visit from a Santa is typically between $75 and $150 he said.

He starts photo shoots in October he said and this year started doing home visits on Nov. 21. The calendar on his website Conwaysanta.com  shows he was fully booked for December by Nov. 10 sometimes with multiple same day bookings.

Santa Craig who says he’s the only Santa in Arkansas to have been inducted into the International Santa Claus Hall of Fame appeared at events at the Arkansas Governor’s Mansion for several years.

Sharon Morris in charge of the mansion’s restoration and preservation said he has attended the mansion’s annual Christmas open house for the past three or four years.

And for the past two years he’s been the star at the mansion’s Breakfast with Santa event.

“He never seems to tire of greeting and interacting with all of the children which makes him so endearing” Morris said.

She initially contacted him because she’d heard about Conway Santa and what a great Santa he was.

“First of all he looks just like a real live Santa Claus — like he just stepped out of his sleigh” Morris said. “He really takes his ‘job’ as Santa seriously and works really hard to give every child — and adult — that magical Christmas experience while he’s here at the mansion.”

SANTA BRENT

People who attended the Fayetteville Christmas Parade in the last two years have seen Santa Brent of Spring-dale.

As Brent Hale he and his wife own the restaurant Big Sexy Food in downtown Springdale. That venue gave him an opportunity to channel his inner Santa and get some experience in the role.

As a child he enjoyed playing Santa around the house.

“My mother always used to get onto me because I’d steal all of her cotton balls to make my Santa beard” he said. That may be why his mom had his first Santa suit made for him when he was about 8 years old as one of his Christmas gifts that year.

He always pictured himself being Santa when he got older. But the restaurant provided an opportunity to get started a little earlier than he’d expected.

“I started portraying Santa at the restaurant for different events” he said. Then in 2018 he got calls to do a couple of appearances. It happened again in 2019.

Then in early 2020 covid-19 hit the U.S. and Santa Brent did mostly Zoom appearances through 2020 and 2021.

“This is only my third year to really do in-person appearances” he said. But it gave him a chance to start slowly and this year he’s had about double the work over last year.

“In a way covid allowed us to grow at a more manageable pace” he said.

Today Santa Brent starts work in mid-November. He poses for Christmas photos; makes in-home visits and appears at corporate events. He even officiates at Christmas weddings.

His rates for appearances are posted on his website Thesantaguy.com. They typically run about $200 for the first hour and $150 for each hour after that. However some rates are lower before December and other rates rise the week before Christmas.

He advises people who want him at an event to book early. His December weekends are nearly fully booked by the end of August he said.

Though Santa Brent’s wife Toni is often busy with the restaurant she works with him occasionally sometimes as Mrs. Claus and sometimes as his helper Dotti the Elf.

SANTA KEVIN

Santa Kevin of Siloam Springs was actually inspired to become Santa by his brother who started in the business a couple of years before he did.

So on Jan. 1 2013 he decided to see if he could grow a beard. By December he had a nice long one.

He began work as Santa at some local restaurants and for friends. The next year he started making more contacts and getting more calls.

Santa Kevin appears at small businesses and visits homes churches and day care centers. He also appears annually at the Riverside Festival of Lights a large Christmas event in Siloam Springs.

When he’s not being Santa Kevin Kevin Williams works full time at J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc.

There are lots of Santas in Northwest Arkansas he said and he and his wife Jackie Williams belong to some Santa groups.

Jackie Williams plays Mrs. Claus at some of his gigs though not all of them Santa Kevin said. Often the children who may be a little skittish around Santa will warm up to her first.

Children also like to have their pictures taken with both Mr. and Mrs. Claus.

Santa Kevin’s favorite events are home visits.

“They’re just more personal” he said. “It’s about the kids you’re visiting and if you go year after year you watch them grow up.” Santa Kevin said he’s been booked for several months for all of his weekends and most of his weeknights.

His rates also change from early in the season through Christmas. Most of the time it’s $150 for the first hour and $100 an hour after that he said. But that rate goes up as Christmas nears.

He charges schools and churches $75. But if they’re really small he doesn’t charge at all.

“Sometimes people will call me and tell me about a family that has something going on and won’t be able to see Santa” he said. “I have no problem making a visit at no charge.” “We don’t want to leave someone without a Santa” he said.

Although professional Santas may make some decent income during the Christmas season Santa Kevin said people don’t realize that much of that is re-invested into the business for things like costumes and liability insurance.

Santa Kevin has lots of advice for anyone considering hiring a Santa.

“Do some research on your Santas” he said. “Call them talk to them ask for references.” He said he and his wife go through background checks and carry insurance as most of the Santas he knows do. “It’s always safety first” he said.

“Be conscious of who you’re hiring” Santa Kevin said.

And the biggest piece of advice he can give?

“Book early!” he said.

SANTA SCHOOLS

There’s actually a whole network of Santas throughout the state and country. Diamond State Santas is the Arkansas chapter of the International Brotherhood of Real Bearded Santas which bills itself as “the world’s largest organization of professional Santa Mrs. Clauses and associates.” The association’s mission according to its website is “to keep Christmas magic in the hearts of children of all ages by creating an international Christmas community.” While the group doesn’t say how many members it has Diamond State Santas has 56 members in its private Face-book group.

For Santa Craig and other professional Santas the job isn’t about playing Santa but becoming Santa. Many training opportunities are available to help them achieve that goal.

One of these is the Worldwide Santa Claus Network which boasts nearly 4000 members around the world. The network serves mainly as an online Santa school with classes on topics such as how to answer children’s questions as Santa Claus; being Santa on cruise ships; and building a Santa Claus business.

Santas who prefer in-person learning can also attend Santa Claus schools around the country.

The oldest is the Charles W. Howard Santa School in Midland Mich. Some other schools are located in Denver; Atlanta; and as close as Branson Mo.

And Santas frequently learn or brush up on skills through conventions and workshops throughout the year.

For most professional Santas it’s not about the money.

It all comes down to the children.

“They’re a hoot” Santa Brent said. “They’re honest they’re open there’s not a thing they won’t say.” “The lack of filter is both fun and hilarious sometimes shocking but ultimately quite a bit of fun.”

(NASDAQ:JKHY) After Its Third-Quarter ...,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) shareholders because the company has just released its latest quarterly results and the shares gained 4.0% to US$169. It was a credible result overall with revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 both in line with analyst estimates showing that Jack Henry & Associates is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.

Check out our latest analysis for Jack Henry & Associates

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a solid 8.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 11% to US$5.75. Before this earnings report the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$181 showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Jack Henry & Associates analyst has a price target of US$200 per share while the most pessimistic values it at US$170. Even so with a relatively close grouping of estimates it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations suggesting Jack Henry & Associates is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.

Taking a look at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same according to the analysts with revenue forecast to display 6.7% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 3.6% per year. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady in line with previous estimates. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$181 with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.

Lau’s full commencement address is here:

Good morning respected teachers administrators parents and the amazing Class of 2022. Before I start I would like to thank all the teachers for coming through for us these last couple of years and therefore I ask all the graduates to stand up and join me in giving all the teachers a round of applause.

Since we’ve spent the last few years giving icebreakers how about we start with one more? My name is Jacob Lau and I’m a Political Science and Public Administration major. My fun fact is that I hope I never have to do another icebreaker again.

The last few years have been tumultuous to say the least. When thinking about what theme to select for this speech only one word came to mind to describe our college experience Perseverance.

The idea of perseverance is built into the lore of the Phoenix.

The Phoenix is an ancient mythological creature found in folklore spanning several cultures that symbolizes renewal and rebirth. It bursts into flames before beginning its new life and soaring.

As we arrived as bright-eyed 18-year olds seething with excitement ready to explore our new home we also dealt with feelings of uncertainty. Do I deserve to be here? What do other people think of me? Will I make any friends? All these thoughts and many others were working their hardest to bring us down yet we persevered.

As we entered our next year those initial feelings went away and were replaced by new ones. Am I doing well enough in class? Why do my friends have their majors picked and I don’t? What classes will help me in my career the most? And while these feelings were perfectly valid they also were surprisingly good at causing anxiety. Yet we still managed to persevere.

Just as 2020 was starting and we were getting ready for spring break I’m sure none of us expected to be sent home and not return until September but that’s just how things pan out I guess. And while online classes were a suitable temporary solution I’m sure all of us would be fine with never doing another zoom class or completing another canvas discussion response. Yet we all managed to persevere.

As school started back up feelings of anxiety over school were coupled with genuine fears of a deadly virus. In addition Covid restrictions did a great job of lowering the rate of infection but they also did a great job of isolating us from one another and crippling the aspect of community once found on campus. Yet us being here today is further evidence of our perseverance.

This is not to say that perseverance is an abstract idea for all of us however. If you look back at the last four or so years you’ll find an experience when you truly persevered and grew from. A moment that might not have yielded an award but a moment you were proud of yourself for not giving up or for taking a risk or for helping someone who struggled just like you. For me that was battling through the pandemic as an immunocompromised person still managing to remain active on campus while also maintaining my mental health and avoiding the virus. (Knock on wood.)

When reflecting on our experiences throughout college I cannot help but be reminded of a quote from Walter Elliot. “Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other”. So while Covid may have robbed us of two of our most important formative years the experiences we gained and the grit we have displayed have contributed to who we are as people today. As we leave here as graduates just know that the next race of life is starting. While it may not seem like it at times you will persevere and rise above just like you’ve done throughout your time here.

Before I leave I would like to take the time to thank those who have helped me throughout my college career. To my wonderful parents and family thank you for always supporting me in all my endeavors. I cherish the freedom you have given me to pursue my dreams. To my professors Katia Levintova David Helpap Ashley Heath and the many others I’ve worked with during my time here thank you for providing me with the tools to succeed in my future career and for your unwavering support through tough times. I wouldn’t be here onstage today if it weren’t for the amazing people who supported me along the way.

Congrats UWGB Class of 2022 we finally made it and for old-time’s sake Go Phoenix.

On Wednesday afternoon a photo was captured of Pedro Pascal and Dakota Johnson kissing quite passionately on the streets of New York where Pascal was seen in a tan blazer and a brown dress shirt while Johnson wore a leather jacket over a white tee. Naturally the image of the two locking lips went viral leading fans to believe this was the sign of a new Hollywood relationship. Turns out it was all just a moment of movie magic.

The pair was caught smooching in TriBeCa as they filmed their new romantic comedy Materialists. Directed by Celine Song—whose debut feature film Past Lives was nominated for Best Picture this year—the upcoming flick follows the dynamic between a matchmaker a wealthy man she meets and her ex. In addition to Johnson and Pascal the movie also stars Chris Evans Zoë Winters Dasha Nekrasova Louisa Jacobson and Marin Ireland.

Materialists just began filming in New York in late April according to World of Reel. There is no confirmed release date yet but the movie is being distributed by A24 and produced by 2AM and Killer Films.

To make matters even more interesting about a week ago Johnson was seen filming a scene with costar Evans and in a few paparazzi photos the pair were captured kissing during their shoot as well. Materialists is clearly going to be a steamy film to say the least.

Johnson is fresh off the release of superhero film Madame Web while Evans just wrapped his Christmas action-comedy Red Ones which costars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and is set to hit theaters on November 15. Meanwhile Pascal has a lot on his plate as he just finished filming Gladiator II in January and is also starring in the noir thriller Tropico which just began filming in April.

They were right.

Johnson’s first year in office has been a roller-coaster ride filled with the ups of having delivered on a checklist of progressive promises — and the downs of managing contentious relationships with Gov. J.B. Pritzker the Illinois General Assembly the business community and police.

There’s even mounting tension with a City Council emboldened by Johnson’s failure to deliver on his signature promise to secure a new revenue source to combat homelessness.

In an interview with the Sun-Times and WBEZ Johnson reflected on his “remarkable journey” to the mayor’s office and the very “different trajectory” he followed to get there.

He said he’s proud of fulfilling so many items on his progressive to-do list and described a year of accomplishments tempered by impatience.

“There are frustrating moments that I do have where you … just wish you could address everything at the same time” Johnson said. “That’s just unfortunately not where we are — just because the damage has been so severe and it has been so widespread” especially in “historically marginalized” communities.

Johnson acknowledged he hasn’t made everybody happy but that comes with the turf.

“If the role of the mayor is to satisfy everyone then we would not have had 56 prior to me” he said.

Migrant crisis missteps

From the beginning Johnson has been dogged by the migrant crisis he inherited. One of his first Council meetings included a cathartic vote on $51 million in surplus funding for the crisis — after a contentious “us-versus-them” debate that reduced one alderperson to tears.

Johnson’s handling of the crisis telegraphed the freshman mayor’s growing pains. He unveiled plans for a winterized camp at a contaminated Southwest Side industrial site only to have Pritzker reject the idea amid environmental concerns.

The local alderperson a progressive ally felt blindsided by the mayor’s plan and was subsequently physically accosted by furious constituents.

The abandoned plan ended up costing Chicago taxpayers nearly $1 million.

But Johnson succeeded in emptying Chicago police station lobbies filled with migrants and returning Chicago Park District field houses to their intended use. He did that by opening brick-and-mortar shelters at a furious pace. At its peak 27 shelters held more than 14600 migrants.

“When I stepped into office … you had contracts that were bloated and it was costing the taxpayers an enormous amount of dollars. ... We’ve transformed all of that. … We’ve saved the taxpayers over $200 million” Johnson said.

But the biggest shelter in Pilsen was crowded and unsanitary. A 5-year-old boy there died of sepsis and it later was the epicenter of a measles outbreak.

Alderpersons are now pushing back on the mayor’s 60-day eviction policy — which was delayed three times and already has forced more than 650 people from shelters.

Johnson also stumbled by initially reneging on a deal with Pritzker and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle one of his political patrons to provide $70 million in additional city funding to support migrants through 2024.

His first budget included just $150 million in funding he knew would last only until April 1. He deliberately lowballed the figure to put pressure on the federal government but the tactic failed. At one point he used $95 million in federal stimulus money to slap an end-of-year Band-Aid on the migrant crisis. But that alienated some alderpersons who control spending and were not consulted.

Johnson’s hand-picked chair of the Council’s Immigrant and Refugee Rights Committee has frequently complained about being shut out of conversations about the migrant crisis including about the mayor’s eviction policy. Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) eventually strong-armed the administration into publishing regular data on evictions.

“There needs to be some work done as it relates to transparency and accountability as well as cooperation and engagement and dialogue with the alders” Vasquez said. “It’s about figuring out how to engage with everybody.”

Alderpersons’ grievances with Johnson were on full display at the last Council meeting where they called for the mayor to be more forthright about migrant funding and equal spending on long disinvested communities.

Even after the griping the Council ultimately passed two of Johnson’s top spending priorities including $70 million from city reserves for migrant spending to honor the deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle.

“I know how to count and both those votes received more than 30 votes from City Council” said Workforce Development Chair Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd). “That sounds like a win to me.”

After closing nearly a dozen shelters amid declining numbers Johnson said he’s “preparing” for a possible influx of migrants in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention in August. But there are “limitations to what we can do” without more federal help he said.

Progress on progressive wish list

Johnson’s legislative successes have been impressive.

In the first year alone he has phased out the subminimum wage for tipped workers; pushed through the most generous paid leave policy in the country; reinstated the city’s Department of Environment; and laid the groundwork to reopen two shuttered mental health clinics.

The mayor has also begun to ease the pressure on Chicago police officers by expanding a plan to send mental health providers instead of police to nonviolent mental health emergencies.

Johnson kept his promise to put a binding referendum on the ballot that would have authorized the Council to increase the real estate transfer tax to create a dedicated funding source for homelessness prevention. But Chicago voters rejected it a major defeat widely viewed as a referendum on the mayor’s first year in office.

Mayoral allies in the Council’s Progressive Caucus heard the message loud and clear and vowed to work harder to win voters’ trust and simplify a complicated referendum that many voters didn’t understand.

“Ignoring what those critiques are and thinking that we’re just morally right isn’t going to lead to future wins” Vasquez said.

At the time Johnson responded to the defeat with bravado warning anyone who might assume one defeat would make him put the brakes on his progressive agenda to “buckle up.”

More recently the mayor won Council approval for a $1.25 billion bond issue devised by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot to fund housing and economic development programs. The same goes for Lightfoot’s plan which Johnson expanded to transform nearly vacant buildings along La Salle Street into more affordable residential units.

Canceling the city’s contract with the gunshot detection technology company known as ShotSpotter also delivered on a progressive promise. Johnson and his base have long viewed ShotSpotter as a surveillance tool that leads to overpolicing in Black and Brown communities.

But Johnson’s decision was somewhat overshadowed by his delivery. He announced it just days before the contract was to expire then scrambled to negotiate an extension through the historically violent summer months and the Democratic National Convention.

ShotSpotter and the broken migrant funding promise with Pritzker and Preckwinkle were the subject of a disastrous Feb. 15 news conference showcasing a communication problem dominating Johnson’s first year in office.

He evaded some questions answered in platitudes and declined to say if he’d walked away from a migrant funding deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle or nailed down the ShotSpotter extension before announcing a phase-out.

That defining moment in his relationship with the media seems to have led to a course correction. Johnson finally named a permanent communications director in Ronnie Reese who had essentially filled the role since Johnson took office. Johnson also hired a chief strategy officer Joe Calvello who learned the art of being “radically open and honest” while guiding U.S. Sen. John Fetterman D-Pa. through a difficult campaign dominated by health issues.

The changes appear to have made an impact already with Johnson taking media questions more often and answering those questions a bit more directly.

Mixed bag for business

Johnson’s aggressive agenda such as costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage put him at odds with the business community.

But labor leaders said Johnson also had displayed a willingness to compromise on both issues even as business groups kept “moving the goalposts.”

“They were looking not to compromise. They’re just looking to stop the policy. And that’s not realistic” said Chicago Federation of Labor President Bob Reiter noting similar policies have been adopted by other major cities.

Johnson also appeared to extend an olive branch with recent rollouts of pro-development policies. And his choice of seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright as commissioner of Planning and Development also was applauded by the business community.

Besides the La Salle Street plan the mayor proposed recommendations to cut bureaucratic red tape on business development and revived the long-stalled O’Hare expansion project by hammering out a cost-cutting deal with the major airlines.

Johnson also held the line on city property taxes — though he allowed Chicago Public Schools to boost property taxes to the limit two years in a row.

“It’s been a little bit up and down. Some positives. Some negatives” Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce President Jack Lavin said of Johnson’s first year adding there’s “a lot of work to be done to improve communication” and trust between the mayor and the business community.

“He has a tax agenda. We have ideas on how we can grow the economy. And we’re going to have to come together because federal money is drying up. There’s lots of fiscal cliffs and fiscal challenges coming up” Lavin said. “He’s the mayor. We’ve all got to work together. If the mayor is not successful Chicago’s not going to be successful.”

With two of four city employee pension funds hovering perilously close to insolvency Johnson has displayed some financial acumen by continuing a Lightfoot policy of making additional payments. He also appointed a working group to study the $35 billion crisis — which has yet to produce any ideas on solving it.

Goodwill from police is short-lived

Johnson’s choice of Larry Snelling as police superintendent played to rave reviews. A commanding and reassuring presence he’s already won the support of the demoralized rank and file.

The mayor also extended the police contract and sweetened police raises. But the feel-good period was somewhat short-lived.

He infuriated officers by twice asking Council members to reject an arbitrator’s ruling allowing officers accused of the most serious wrongdoing to bypass the Police Board taking their cases to arbitration.

“For a Democratic mayor to be so anti-union it’s pretty breathtaking” said Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara.

As expected a judge sided with the union — but agreed to make the arbitration process more public and that meant the back-to-back Council votes were more than “symbolic” Johnson said.

Johnson did keep a campaign promise to hire 200 new detectives and free officers for street duty by hiring civilians to perform office jobs. And to the consternation of some progressive allies he increased the police budget to nearly $1.99 billion.

Still Snelling told a town hall in Jefferson Park recently that Chicago remains down about 2000 officers citywide and struggles with low recruitment.

Like Lightfoot Johnson has devised a plan to get at the root causes of crime. His hyperlocal version focuses on 10 multiblock areas in four neighborhoods: Englewood Austin Little Village and West Garfield Park.

Those neighborhoods — plagued by school closings and high dropout rates while lacking public amenities like parks and libraries — will receive an array of services including priority in another round of the city’s guaranteed minimum income program.

Johnson has also put a heavy focus on creating more summer jobs and neighborhood recreational opportunities for young people to give them alternatives to a trend of mass downtown gatherings that have turned violent.

Shootings and homicides are down slightly but robberies remain stubbornly high. In neighborhoods citywide Chicagoans continue to feel unsafe waking up to reports of another wave of strong-armed robberies store break-ins and carjackings.

Reducing violent crime remains such a priority alderpersons who believe ShotSpotter is an effective prevention tool have vowed to perhaps symbolically defy the mayor and tie his hands on ending the contract.

Johnson plays Council tie-breaker

Twice in the first year Johnson was forced to cast tie-breaking Council votes: To save his now-ousted Zoning chair and floor leader Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th) from censure; and to approve a nonbinding resolution for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

The cease-fire resolution strained Johnson’s relationship with many Jewish leaders and the only Jewish alderperson Debra Silverstein (50th). Some Jewish elected officials and civic leaders — including the Anti-Defamation League Midwest state Sen. Sara Feigenholtz and state Rep. Bob Morgan — later declined the mayor’s invitation to a recent meeting meant to ease the tension.

But not supporting the resolution would have diminished his relationships with progressives and Arab Americans. He noted that calling for a cease-fire is in line with his values and several progressive pro-Palestinian Jewish groups did attend the meeting.

“As far as me calling for peace I hardly consider that controversial. ... The entire country and people around the world are calling for that. That’s something that we value as residents of the city of Chicago but it’s also part of our responsibility as global residents that calling for peace and an end to war is a part of our very profound tradition” he said.

The Chicago area’s large Palestinian community demanded for months that Johnson and his Council majority take a stand voicing their feelings at numerous raucous Council meetings.

The division caused by the war has spread to college campuses in Chicago and nationwide foreshadowing the civil disobedience that might occur when Democrats gather here in August to formally nominate President Joe Biden for reelection.

If Johnson is too timid he risks allowing demonstrators to run roughshod over Chicago. If he allows Chicago police to be too heavy-handed he runs the risk of civil rights violations and the inevitable comparison to the disaster of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

Johnson’s first chief of staff Rich Guidice a seasoned City Hall lifer was widely expected to serve through the convention bringing the expertise garnered from guiding Chicago through decades of major events. But Guidice abruptly resigned last month.

The tie-breaking vote that spared Ramirez-Rosa from censure followed his resignation from leadership after apologizing for bullying and threatening colleagues to block a symbolic referendum on whether Chicago should remain a sanctuary city.

Johnson hasn’t named a replacement for Ramirez-Rosa — either as Zoning chair or floor leader. Some Council members are demanding a replacement from the Latino Caucus but Johnson has yet to find someone he trusts who can also win alderpersons’ support.

Meanwhile some of Johnson’s progressive supporters said they believe rushing to force Ramirez-Rosa’s resignation went too far and an apology should have sufficed.

Backing the Bears puzzles progressives

Progressives were also left scratching their heads when Johnson embraced the Bears’ plan for a sprawling domed stadium south of Soldier Field — a project requiring billions of state and federal dollars that haven’t been approved or identified.

When the Bears unveiled their stadium plan Johnson acted more like a cheerleader than a guardian of taxpayers and protector of precious lakefront parkland.

Asked if the plan violated the city ordinance prohibiting new construction along the lakefront Johnson referred to the Bears’ promise of increased green space on the Museum Campus. But he failed to mention those additional 14 acres are possible only if the state and federal governments cover all $1.5 billion in infrastructure costs.

Putting the Bears stadium near the top of his legislative wish list contradicts Johnson’s campaign stance. Now though Johnson calls Soldier Field a “100-year-old building” — even though it was rebuilt in 2003. Paying off what’s owed on that renovation will drain city coffers unless the debt is refinanced in the new stadium funding package.

“If someone else has another solution that addresses this problem then they should put that on the table” Johnson said.

Every mayor loves a giant public works project. They generate jobs contracts and political donations and are a feel-good diversion from Chicago’s intransigent problems. Then-Mayor Richard M. Daley had his failed 2016 Olympic bid. Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel had Elon Musk’s high-speed tunnel train to O’Hare Airport.

Johnson’s stadium plan similarly appears to be going nowhere. Springfield has far higher priorities.

“The position he’s taking there … seems to run at odds with his key base of support from progressives. I understand the temptation and desire to put forward a signature project — a legacy project if you will … But it just seems like an unforced error in the way he rolled it out” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.

“Unforced errors is sort of a common theme that we are seeing in many respects. … Communication with the public and the press remains lacking” he said.

At the Bears’ announcement Johnson was “speaking in platitudes from scripted remarks” and couldn’t “really engage with the questions being asked” Greising said which undermined “his ability to earn support from people most affected by the decisions he is making.”

Pritzker did not address the Bears stadium controversy or other points of tension with Johnson saying instead: “The first year of any administration is often the most challenging and I commend Mayor Johnson and his team for reaching this milestone.”

Springfield stumbles

A stadium defeat would not be Johnson’s first in Springfield.

Last month the Illinois House voted 92-8 to approve a bill curbing the power of Johnson’s revamped hand-picked school board. A Senate committee did the same last week during Johnson’s first Springfield lobbying trip as mayor. The bill would prevent Chicago Public Schools from making any admissions or funding changes to selective-enrollment programs and from closing any schools until a fully elected school board takes control in early 2027.

There was no mistaking the message to Johnson’s board which wants to prioritize investing in neighborhood schools over choice schools like selective-enrollments. The original bill was amended to extend an existing moratorium on closing all schools and not just selective schools after lobbying by the CTU.

Asked what message he took from the vote to tie his hands on an important education issue Johnson noted it still needs final approval.

“It’s not a law so nothing has happened” he said.

An emotional CTU President Stacy Davis Gates — perhaps reflecting on setbacks like these — told supporters last fall she was “ashamed of myself” for having helped put Johnson — “my brother” she called him — in “an impossible place.”

Asked recently what made her ashamed Davis Gates talked about the resistance Johnson had faced during his first year.

“Transformation is happening right now in Chicago and every corner of the city because of his leadership. And that level of transformation either makes you a hero or it makes you a villain” Davis Gates said. “It’s not lukewarm. It’s either hot or cold and that is a very precarious position to live in.”

Remaking Chicago Public Schools

As a candidate Johnson promised to make progressive changes to CPS and he has.

His revamped board is led by former science teacher Jianan Shi who also led the parent advocacy group Raise Your Hand for Illinois Public Education. Johnson’s board is filled with others with community-organizing experience.

That board has delivered on a promise to shift away from student-based budgeting that progressives argue exacerbates challenges at schools serving low-income communities and toward a need-based funding model.

But he’s already disappointed some parents by sticking with a plan for a phased-in elected school board instead of delivering that pivotal reform in one fell swoop.

Johnson will also have to find a way to deliver for the schools parents and his former colleagues at the teachers union without breaking the bank in the CTU contract he is now negotiating. Teachers started out by demanding a 9% raise or to match inflation whichever is higher.

“I know what it takes — from a teacher’s perspective as well as a parent’s perspective and a student’s perspective — to have a more transformational educational experience” Johnson said. “And that’s what our focus has to be: funding our schools and actually transforming them so that they are fully fully expressed in an equitable way.”

CPS faces a $391 million deficit for the upcoming school year not including raises being negotiated for teachers and a 4% raise already promised to support staff. The CTA and other mass transit agencies are facing their own funding cliffs.

That’s another point of contention between Johnson and Pritzker.

The governor and others are demanding a leadership change at CTA before providing any new money. Others want to merge all four Chicago-area mass transit agencies into a single super-agency to reduce costs improve operations and create a uniform fare system.

Johnson harshly critical of CTA performance during the campaign has stuck with embattled CTA President Dorval Carter Jr. no favorite of Chicago alderpersons.

When Pritzker dared demand a leadership change the mayor replied he alone gets to choose the CTA president adding “If people want to be mayor they should run for it.”

Room to grow into job

Johnson likes to say he intends to serve for 23 years — long enough to become Chicago’s longest-serving mayor bypassing Richard M. Daley.

But that will require him to grow and mature in the job and survive many upcoming tests. While his first budget made no real political waves the second will demand making cuts raising property taxes or finding new sources of revenue while still chipping away at his commitment to invest in people.

Despite Johnson’s gestures to the business community Greising said many business leaders he talks to “feel like they still don’t know him still don’t understand what he’s trying to do and what they can do for him — and still don’t feel heard by him.

“Every successful mayor has found a way to have the business community with him. And this mayor so far doesn’t seem to work very hard on that.

“We shouldn’t be all that surprised when we elect someone with his background that there’s a very steep learning curve” he said. “But … he really needs to invest his effort into growing in those areas where he is falling short. If he doesn’t do that with urgency then it will be too late.”

Davis Gates acknowledged the growing pains.

“For so long in this city people who have needed [the most] have been told ‘no’” she said. Now after years of “demanding a thing happens fighting for a thing to happen protesting rallying door-knocking” progressives are in charge she said.

“To make things happen those are different muscles ... The muscles that we have to develop now — not just as a movement not just as a mayor but as an entire city — is No. 1 we’ve got to get more inclusive. We’ve got to figure out how to work past our differences” she said.

It will take some time for this “new formation that we have in Chicago” to settle in Johnson said.

“The way these systems have been built particularly government they have been built in a very complex way to favor the few” he said.

“There has been sort of an unfettered access of a handful of powerful people having access to the fifth floor” the mayor said. “Maybe they’re not used to sharing. And that’s going to take some adjustment.”

Mayor's up-and-down first year in office Mayor’s up-and-down first year in office • The migrant crisis has dominated much of Johnson’s first year: The crisis exposed the growing pains of a new mayor and exacerbated historic tensions between Chicago’s Black and Hispanic communities. One key setback: Johnson’s determination to locate a migrant camp at a contaminated industrial site in Brighton Park. Gov. J.B. Pritzker canceled that project over those environmental concerns.



• It’s been a mixed bag on progressives’ wish list: Johnson was able to get the Chicago City Council to eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and require city employers to give their employees at least 10 paid days off a year. But voters rejected his “Bring Chicago Home” referendum which would have increased the real estate transfer tax and used the money to fund programs to reduce homelessness.



• His relationship with the business community has been rocky: He enacted those costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage but also helped developers with an initiative to cut bureaucratic red tape and his decision to move forward on a plan to convert some LaSalle Street office buildings in the Loop for residential use. And he broke a stalemate with United and American airlines to reduce costs and move forward with a massive multi-billion-dollar expansion and renovation of O’Hare International Airport.



• Unease about Johnson’s inexperience was soothed by some of his early appointments: Rich Guidice a City Hall veteran recently retired from the Office of Emergency Management and Communications returned as Johnson’s chief of staff though he lasted less than a year. Seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright became commissioner of the city’s Planning and Development Department. And Johnson’s choice as police superintendent Larry Snelling had been with CPD for years and remains popular with the rank-and-file.



• Johnson spent some of his fragile political capital in casting tie-breaking votes in the Council: One was on a symbolic resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The mayor’s other tie-breaking vote was to save Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa from censure. The alderperson Johnson’s floor leader was accused of bullying some fellow members.



• Every mayor loves a big jobs-creating public works project: Richard M. Daley had his Olympic bid Rahm Emanuel had his high-speed tunnel to O’Hare that Elon Musk was going to build. Johnson’s appears to be the Bears’ bid for a new lakefront domed stadium but jumping on board so soon when the level of public funding is so high — and still in doubt “seems like an unforced error” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.



• Johnson’s experience as a teacher plays a role: Johnson a former organizer for the Chicago Teachers Union owes his election in part to the support of that union and entered office with teachers’ support. And while he has remade the CPS board — and the board has shifted schools to a need-based funding formula he also disappointed parents by backing away from shifting to an all-elected school board right away opting instead to phase in elected members.

A seemingly ever-present topic of conversation in the MMA world is the topic of fighter pay in the UFC. But while that conversation primarily focuses on fighters’ show money win money bonuses and pay-per-view points there are other instances that don’t immediately jump to mind like likeness rights. And while UFC is primarily a fight promotion the company also has a longstanding licensing deal with EA Games to produce the UFC video game series. So how does that work for the fighters?

Well Johnson recently described the entire thing on his YouTube channel.

“One day I’m at home I’m playing video games and I get an email stating that ‘Hey since your likeness is being used a lot in the video game we are sending you a check’” Johnson said. “Now the very first check I got for being in the UFC video game was $25000. A lot of you guys are like ‘That was it?’ Guys think about this $25000 to just be in a video game. I don’t think Ryu [or] Ken has ever gotten a check for $25000. [It’s] $25000 for not getting punched in the face $25000 for just being in a video game because you people love using me as a character. So I was ecstatic.

“How do they dictate how much money you’re going to get paid? I can’t dictate it. You guys actually dictate how much I get paid by how often you guys use me in the game. When you log onto your game let’s say you’re playing offline mode or you’re playing online mode each character you pick it does a little tick and sends the data to the mainframe computer. That’s how they keep track of it. ... They do it for all the games out there because they want to see what characters are being played the most and what game modes you like the most. They’re always tracking your data and keeping all the analytics.

“I think that’s fair. It’s based on your popularity in the game. So if everybody and their mom keeps playing me I will get a bigger check.”

Johnson is widely considered to be one of the greatest fighters in UFC history so it’s not surprising that he’s a popular character choice for fans. In fact Johnson was so popular that he also served as the cover athlete for a specialty edition of EA UFC 3 which “Mighty Mouse” explained came with a little extra money for him.

“So let’s fast forward: The next one that came out was UFC 3 and for this bad boy the next check that I ended up getting was $12500” Johnson said. “Now it’s a little bit lower but I was OK with that because the timeframe of the checks was coming every year or quarter. I wasn’t too worried about it because once again it’s free money just coming to me.

“Now after I did something after my Ray Borg fight they offered me the opportunity to be on the front cover. That’s when they came out with the Icon Edition with me on the front. ... So in order for me to be on the cover I signed an agreement to be on the front cover and with me signing I got a whopping $10000 — $10000 to be on the front cover and it’s pretty dope. I love every bit of it.”

There are currently five iterations of the EA Sports UFC titles with the most recent released this past October. Johnson has been in all of them aside from the first even after leaving the promotion in 2018. Johnson said he has yet to receive his check from the latest edition but for the three version of the game he has been in including his time as a cover athlete “Mighty Mouse” revealed his grand total of payouts comes to just under $75000.

“Let’s fast forward: UFC 4 comes out” Johnson said. “I leave the UFC I’m not part of the company anymore but my character is still in the game and you guys are playing as my character. The next check I get in the mail is another whopping $25000. For being in a game! And it’s absolutely amazing because to me it’s something where your likeness is being used and I think it’s cool where the UFC or EA keeps on paying the athletes for their likeness and that people are using me.

“Now after all that from the first iteration of me being in the game in 2014 all the way to 2024 the total money I have made is a whopping $72500. I think it’s absolutely amazing for me to make that type of money without getting punched in the face.

“Now I have not gotten a check yet for UFC 5 which I’m in the game. ... Obviously when you guys use me as a character and my popularity is still good I will also receive another check from EA or Zuffa or whoever the hell is in charge of the UFC now. So I think it’s pretty cool.”

Likeness rights in sports video games can be wide-ranging. For instance the NFL Players Association struck a deal with the Madden franchise that reportedly paid the players $500 million over a five-year extension while the NBA 2K deal was reportedly for $1.1 billion over seven years. Conversely EA Sports College Football 25 will reportedly only offer athletes featured in the game $600 and a copy of the game."

And if this comes to fruition it’s a big win for the borough.

The plan is for NorthPoint Development to engage in a joint venture with the owner of the Rossville property that contains the LNG tanks and use both that site and the former 240-acre Kinder Morgan Terminal location in Charleston for an offshore wind hub.

NorthPoint recently partnered with Michael Stamatis president and CEO of Red Hook Terminals which has a lease on the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal that is transforming into an offshore wind hub. The new Staten Island venture he said offers an unprecedented opportunity to bolster the city’s presence in the industry.

And we agree.

For too long the LNG tanks — which were constructed in 1976 and never filled with the highly explosive fuel they were built to hold — have been a blight on Staten Island. Over the years there have been a variety of plans for how the tanks would be dismantled and what could exist there. The proposals range from a self-sufficient religious community to a shopping mall movie theater and park.

While all those ideas have merit for different reasons we believe that having this site become an important link in New York’s offshore wind industry is by far the best option.

This plan would rid Staten Island of those mammoth tanks and at the same time allow the borough to become an important offshore wind hub that will create hundreds of construction and permanent jobs.

NorthPoint Development also won a bid last week to expand its planned offshore wind operations to a 33-acre city-owned site that sits directly adjacent to the LNG site in the shape of a crescent moon. The city previously issued a request for proposals for the land and said it was prioritizing the site for offshore wind use.

The two parcels combined surpasses 100 acres. We are happy the NYCEDC saw the value of having the city-owned site added to the parcel NorthPoint will be developing for offshore wind uses.

New York State law dictates the state have 70% of its electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2030 and calls for the development of 9000 megawatts of offshore wind energy by 2035.

This project along with Arthur Kill Terminal an offshore wind turbine assembly facility proposed for Richmond Valley would allow Staten Island to become a major component in the state’s offshore wind energy goals.

This is a win-win situation for Staten Island – we’d finally get rid of the LNG tanks and at the same time create hundreds of jobs and claim our stake as a leader in the offshore wind industry.

Cerberus Capital Management a big private equity firm has long attracted controversy. In 2007 it took over Chrysler but after two years of Cerberus ownership the company needed a government bailout to stay in business. It spent years buying up companies that made guns — one of which was used by Adam Lanza in 2012 to kill 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Conn.

Now the firm which has some $60 billion in assets is trying to pull off a deal that is expected to face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators. Cerberus is the largest investor in Albertsons the country’s second-largest supermarket chain by revenue. In October Kroger which is nearly twice the size of Albertsons announced it was going to buy its smaller rival for $24.6 billion. If the deal were to go through without any government-mandated divestitures the combined company would own some 5000 stores making it by far the dominant grocery chain in the country. The two companies hope to complete the deal in early 2024 according to federal filings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndsYnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTkvc3VydmVpbGxhbmNlLXNob3dzLXN1c3BlY3QtZmlyZWQtbXVsdGlwbGUtc2hvdHMtaW50by12ZWhpY2xlLWtyb2dlci1wYXJraW5nLWxvdC1iZWZvcmUtZmxlZWluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surveillance shows suspect fired multiple shots into vehicle in Kroger parking lot before fleeing,"JACKSON Miss. (WLBT) - Surveillance video released by Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones sheds more light on the Sunday night shooting at the I-55 North Kroger in Jackson.

A suspect wearing a light and dark-colored coat appears to fire multiple shots into a sedan in the grocery store’s parking lot before he flees outside of the camera’s view.

The suspect is believed to have gotten into a black SUV seen driving behind the victim’s vehicle shortly before the shooting.

A second video shows the alleged shooter and two others leave the store. The other suspects include a man seen wearing a black sweater white pants and sneakers and a woman wearing a dark jacket and glasses.

Authorities say two people were shot including a man who is now in critical condition at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.

Jones gave an update during a press conference on Monday.

Around 7 p.m. Sunday two people were shot at the store after an “encounter” inside the store spilled out into the parking lot.

The victims are Aaila Lawson 20 and Maurice Barney 20. Both were taken to the University of Mississippi Medical Center where Barney is in critical condition.

Barney according to the sheriff was shot multiple times. Lawson was shot once in the leg. Lawson was said to be in stable condition.

Deputies are looking for three suspects in the case.

“Ast least one... male got out of a dark-colored SUV and filed multiple shots into their vehicle striking both of them” Jones said. “We believe that the black SUV was occupied and being driven by another unidentified... male and unidentified... female.”

When WLBT arrived on the scene Sunday night a large portion of the store’s parking lot had been blocked off with yellow tape.

Two vehicles were located behind the tape with shattered glass on the ground.

A deputy sheriff was working an off-duty security assignment at the store when the incident occurred. That deputy called out with “shots fired” at about 6:58 p.m. Deputies responded from various locations in the county the sheriff said.

Anyone with any information is asked to call (601) 352-1521 or

HCSO Deputies are on scene investigating a shooting at Kroger parking lot on I-55N. Two injured and transported to UMMC for medical treatment. Suspect is described as a BM that fled on foot and possibly left in a dark SUV. Investigation is ongoing and more information to come. — TyreeJonesSheriff (@TyreeSheriff) December 19 2022

KROGER has revealed a major change to layout of some stores thrilling shoppers who don't have a lot of time on their hands.

The retailer is adding additional Saladworks and a Zalat Pizza location in multiple stores.

Kroger's two new Saladworks locations are opening in the Columbus Ohio area and the chain's second Zalat Pizza location is heading to Houston Texas Winsight Grocery Business reports.

Saladworks has of course salads as well as soups paninis and sandwiches.

While there are pre-selected salads there is also an option to build your own or build your own wrap.

""As Saladworks continues to grow we are excited to have our menu offered at Mix Food Hall locations in Columbus"" said Lauriena Bornstein Saladworks chief brand officer in a statement.

""It is our priority to provide individuals and families with healthy food options that are quick and accessible and partnering with Kitchen United's Mix Food Hall has allowed us to continue to provide fresh healthy meal options to more people in the communities we serve.""

The restaurant noted that customers ""will be able to place orders at on-site kiosks at Kroger locations or on Mix Food Hall’s website in addition to third-party delivery apps.""

The chain launched at Kroger in 2020 in Cincinnati.

They have since expanded to more locations throughout Ohio and to a location in Kentucky.

Zalat is a Texas-based pizza chain.

They have 27 locations but this is the second inside a Kroger.

“Kroger is incredibly pleased to expand our partnership with Zalat Pizza through the introduction of a second in-store restaurant following the continued success of the first location at our Towne Lake Marketplace” Liz Colvin vice president of merchandising for Kroger’s Houston Division said.

“We’re certain our Conroe Marketplace customers will be equally hungry for all Zalat Pizza offers.”

Zalat is equally excited for the partnership.

“We are especially excited that Kroger is interested in us because of our best-of-class quality and dedication to our craft” Zalat Pizza CEO and founder Khanh Nguyen said.

“Our model has always been about maintaining the highest levels of execution at large scale and we’re excited that Kroger shares our vision.""

The restaurant will offer ""takeout and third-party delivery in-store pizza by the slice retail take-and-bake pizzas and limited indoor and patio seating.""

It comes as Kroger launched with Kitchen United three Mix Food Hall locations this fall.

The semi-food courts are home to the new Saladworks locations.

The following are the placements for the food courts which are located in Ohio:

Clintonville: Hardee's Pei Wei Asian Kitchen Wow-Bao Nektar Juice Saladworks Fuku Fried Chicken

Dublin: Capriotti's Sandwich Shop Wing Zone Pei Wei Asian Kitchen Nathan's Famous Nektar Juice Bar Fuku Fried Chicken

Gahanna: Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs Genghis Grill Wow-Bao Nekter Juice Bar Fuku Fried Chicken Saladworks

Diners can mix and match items from independent restaurants into one order.

Kitchen United Chief Executive Officer Michael Montagano said: ""Kitchen United is proud to open its first Mix Food Hall in the Columbus area.

""Families and groups who can't agree on what to have for lunch or dinner will love the ability to order different foods from different restaurants all in one order.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL2RlYy8xNi9zZWxmLWNoZWNrb3V0LXVzLXJldGFpbC13YWxtYXJ00gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvZGVjLzE2L3NlbGYtY2hlY2tvdXQtdXMtcmV0YWlsLXdhbG1hcnQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Unexpected item’: how self-checkouts failed to live up to their promise,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL2RlYy8xNi9zZWxmLWNoZWNrb3V0LXVzLXJldGFpbC13YWxtYXJ00gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvZGVjLzE2L3NlbGYtY2hlY2tvdXQtdXMtcmV0YWlsLXdhbG1hcnQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024DFDC3E650>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

A MAJOR change at Kroger and Albertsons may damage your wallet as mass layoff fears have been sparked.

The proposed $24.6billion merger would give the combined company control of at least one-fifth of the US grocery market with nearly 5000 stores across 48 states.

The deal would combine more than 2700 Kroger and 2200 Albertsons grocery stores across the United States.

While the two companies have touted the merger as an opportunity to provide millions of Americans with fresh and affordable food while enhancing technology and innovation some retail experts believe it could have unintended consequences for shoppers.

With Kroger already operating as the largest grocery chain in the United States Forbes Contributor Errol Schweizer warned that the merger could make it difficult for unions to negotiate for higher wages or better benefits and lead to potential layoffs in office jobs like marketing and digital sales.

Schweizer pointed to a 2004 grocery strike that ended after Kroger and Albertsons joined together against the employees.

Additionally the merger could cause issues throughout the supply chain.

“A merger would give the combined company tremendous purchasing power with suppliers” Schweizer wrote.

“A 5000 store chain in over 40 states could more easily set payment terms negotiate shelf space and assortment and extract better costs and greater trade allowances for promotions couponing ad placement and slotting fees.”

“Whether or not those savings get passed onto consumers is more of a function of how competitive the markets are. Most likely such revenue will pad the bottom line lining the pockets of institutional investors and asset managers who own large swathes of the stock.”

The consolidation of grocery stores in the United States has grown in the past ten years and is one of the contributing factors to price inflation the Forbes contributor also noted.

Regional retailers will face even more competition to reduce their rates if the Kroger and Albertsons merger succeeds.

The merger has also received intense pushback from representatives in Washington DC.

Minnesota Democrat Amy Klobuchar suggested in a recent committee hearing that the merger would contribute to price hikes according to the New York Times.

Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah stated that the companies had failed to explain “why the merger is necessary in the first place.”

The two company CEOs Rodney McMullen of Kroger and Vivek Sankaran of Albertsons testified before senators on the Competition Policy Antitrust and Consumer Rights subcommittee to defend their planned merger.

They claimed that the plan combining the companies having Kroger buy Albertsons for $20 billion would create more competition among retail grocers and big box stores contrary to senators' concerns.

The newly combined company would reap significant economies of scale they said which would purportedly keep prices low.

In a letter Congress said: ""We urge the Federal Trade Commission to closely evaluate the likely competitive effect of this acquisition.""

""This acquisition threatens to create competition-stifling concentration in markets across the country hurting consumers workers and small businesses"" Congress warned.

""Kroger’s proposed acquisition of Albertsons presents several anticompetitive concerns.""

The companies are hoping to complete the merger by 2024."
LHX,L3Harris,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDIyLzEyLzE5L2wzaGFycmlzLW1vdmVzLXRvLWFjcXVpcmUtYWVyb2pldC1yb2NrZXRkeW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L3Harris moves to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne,"WASHINGTON — L3Harris Technologies plans to acquire propulsion expert Aerojet Rocketdyne in a deal valued at $4.7 billion the two companies announced Sunday.

The move comes after Lockheed Martin ended its acquisition effort in February.

L3Harris which is the United States’ sixth-largest defense company said it would pay $58 per share in an all-cash deal to acquire the defense contractor which specializes in propulsion systems and energetics. Aerojet which generates about $2.3 billion in annual revenue has facilities in California Arkansas Florida Alabama and Washington among other states.

Two years ago Lockheed announced it would acquire Aerojet but the deal quickly drew controversy. Raytheon Technologies publicly objected saying the transaction would force it to negotiate with Lockheed a major competitor for solid-rocket motors.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren D-Mass. also questioned the deal and called for the Federal Trade Commission to examine it.

In early 2022 the FTC announced a lawsuit that sought to block the proposed $4.4 billion merger on antitrust grounds. The agency said it was concerned the deal would hurt competition in the defense industry by allowing Lockheed to cut off other contractors from vital missile components Aerojet provides particularly scramjet engines for hypersonic missiles and control systems for missile interceptors.

Weeks later Lockheed announced it would no longer seek to acquire Aerojet. In a statement Jim Taiclet Lockheed’s chief executive said the company “determined that in light of the FTC’s actions terminating the transaction is in the best interest of our stakeholders.”

L3Harris has dramatically reshaped itself in recent years. In 2019 L3 Technologies and Harris Corp. merged into what became the ninth-largest defense firm in the world at the time. The year before L3 Technologies ranked 18th and Harris Corp. ranked 26th.

The combined company with $14.9 billion in 2021 defense revenue was the 10th largest defense firm in this year’s rankings. Aerojet’s nearly $1.5 billion in defense revenue put the company at 65th place on this year’s Defense News Top 100 list.

In its announcement Sunday L3Harris and Aerojet said the deal “will ensure the defense industrial base and our customers will have a strengthened merchant supplier to effectively address both current and emerging threats — and promote scientific discovery and innovation — through targeted investment in advanced missile technologies hypersonics and more.”

The deal is slated to close in 2023 and requires regulatory approvals.

The deal comes exactly two years after Lockheed Martin sought to buy Aerojet in a $4.4 billion bid that was blocked by antitrust regulators earlier this year.

L3Harris is buying Aerojet at $58 per share in an all-cash transaction. Aerojet shares traded at $54.89 on Dec. 16. The deal is expected to close in 2023 pending regulatory approvals.

Aerojet Rocketdyne based in Sacramento California manufactures rocket engines and propulsion systems for space vehicles ballistic missiles and military tactical weapons. The company generates approximately $2.3 billion in annual revenue.

L3Harris headquartered in Melbourne Florida is a global defense and aerospace firm with $17 billion in annual revenue.

The acquisition of Aerojet would give L3Harris a greater footprint in civil space strategic defense systems and precision munitions.

“With this acquisition we will use the combined talents of more than 50000 employees to drive continuous process improvement enhance business operations and elevate the performance of this crucial national asset” L3Harris CEO Christopher Kubasik said in a statement.

Aerojet’s CEO Eileen Drake said the sale of the company to L3Harris will “accelerate innovation for national security propulsion solutions while providing a premium cash value for our shareholders and tremendous benefits for our employees customers partners and the communities in which we operate.”

According to media reports multiple buyers were interested in acquiring Aerojet including General Electric Textron and private equity firms.

As the last remaining independent U.S. supplier of propulsion systems for tactical missiles Aerojet has been at the center of a contentious battle for the past two years over the consolidation of aerospace and defense industry firms. The Pentagon never publicly disclosed its views on Lockheed’s attempt to buy Aerojet but made it clear in a report that it would challenge the vertical integration of defense suppliers.

Aerojet executives and some lawmakers have argued that the company needs more financial resources to invest in next-generation technologies and would be better off as part of a larger defense contractor rather than as an independent company.

‘Strengthened merchant supplier’

The Federal Trade Commission in February blocked Lockheed’s bid arguing that the deal would give Lockheed — a major supplier of tactical missiles — the ability to “cut off other defense contractors from the critical components they need to build competing missiles.”

L3Harris said Dec. 18 the acquisition will “ensure the defense industrial base and our customers will have a strengthened merchant supplier to effectively address both current and emerging threats – and promote scientific discovery and innovation – through targeted investment in advanced missile technologies hypersonics and more.”

Aerojet and L3Harris would combine complementary programs and not likely create the vertical integration concerns that scuttled the deal with Lockheed Martin industry analyst Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners wrote in a research note last month. L3Harris does not have a “significant market position in solid propellant rocket motors or satellite maneuvering systems.”

The acquisition of Aerojet would continue L3Harris’ expansion in the defense and space sectors following the 2019 merger of L3 Technologies and Harris Corp. The company in October acquired Viasat’s tactical data link business for $1.96 billion.

If the deal goes through it will bring certainty to Aerojet after two years of turmoil.

The CEO of one of Aerojet’s main customers Raytheon recently complained in a Defense One interview that the quality of Aerojet’s rocket motors and schedule performance have slipped due to the distractions of being for sale.

On the NASA side Aerojet reported delays in the production of RS-25 engines for the Artemis moon program. The company won a $1.79 billion contract from NASA in 2020 to produce a new expendable version of the engine for the Space Launch System to replace the current supply of refurbished Space Shuttle-era RS-25 engines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ob21lLzIwMjIxMjE4MDA1MDUwL2VuL0wzSGFycmlzLXRvLUFjcXVpcmUtQWVyb2pldC1Sb2NrZXRkeW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L3Harris to Acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.businesswire.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/home/20221218005050/en/L3Harris-to-Acquire-Aerojet-Rocketdyne (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D821F43A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ob21lLzIwMjIxMjE4MDA1MDUwL2VuL0wzSGFycmlzLXRvLUFjcXVpcmUtQWVyb2pldC1Sb2NrZXRkeW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2YwZWI2Y2RhLThjMjktNGRiNi05NzJhLWRjNmI5YjJmYWMyYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US defence contractor L3Harris to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.7bn,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

RIBA President Simon Allford said:

“This year’s RIBA President’s Medals celebrate the talent and work of architecture students from around the world. The record number of entries this year address contemporary topics with immense social and environmental significance. As ever the range scope and scale of their inquiry is extremely impressive.

Congratulations to the winners and thank you to the tutors and schools of architecture who have fostered and encouraged such promising minds. I look forward to seeing how they develop these speculations on architecture and life in the years to come.

We have been running these awards for many decades and opened them up to the wider world of non-validated schools when I was VP for education over a decade ago. As well as being a celebration of this year’s student preoccupations the work now adds to our quite extraordinary archive of a long history of student inquiry.

On a personal note I fondly remember awaiting the result of our Silver Medal nominated project with my partners at AHMM over 30 years ago – we were unplaced but of course we consoled ourselves with the fact we were involved!”

With mandatory quarantines easing ferry and airline service resuming and licenses renewed casinos hope 2023 marks a new beginning for the world's preeminent gambling destination Macao.

The Macao government awarded six companies new 10-year concessions to operate their integrated casino resorts. A concession essentially is an operating agreement with the government which in turn licenses the operators.

To win the permission the casino companies agreed to invest collectively nearly $15 billion dollars in Macao to achieve government goals of diversifying the local economy beyond gambling and encouraging international tourism.

CNBC has also learned MGM will benefit from the allotment of 200 more gaming tables though the award comes at the expense of competitors including Wynn's properties according to multiple sources.

""We are confident that our position allocations are more than sufficient to allow us to thrive"" in Macao Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver said. The company serves high-quality players who generate meaningful revenue and profit premiums compared to competing casinos he added.

Las Vegas Sands and Hong Kong-based Galaxy Entertainmen t have the largest real estate footprints in Macao and have committed to the biggest investments.

Sands' agreement for a $3.75 billion dollar investment or 30 billion MOP will be roughly split between capital expenditures and operating expenses. Most of the investment will go toward non-gaming projects like a new conference facility and a luxury yacht experience that appeal to foreign visitors according to a company statement.

An executive in the company who asked not to be named characterized the financial commitment as a win as it entails investments that likely would have been made anyway — as opposed to an operating fee forked over in exchange for a license.

The sentiment is similar at MGM Resorts  which plans to invest its $2.1 billion commitment in three main areas: culture entertainment and medical tourism.

This month Macao has seen an increase in tourism from mainland China from visitors trying to get an mRNA Covid vaccine. The BioNTech shots have not been approved in mainland China but in Macao a Special Administrative Region or SAR the Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST) Hospital offers vaccinations for tourists.

Wynn Resorts ' commitment to a $2.2 billion investment over the next decade will incorporate plans for state-of-the-art theater and restaurant experiences. It also plans to expand its sales presence around Asia and North America to boost international tourism.

Melco Resorts and Entertainment announced the return of its House of Dancing Water extravaganza which has been suspended since the beginning of the pandemic. It will also build an indoor water park. The company also plans to focus on medical tourism by building a clinic with MRI and other advanced imaging technology.

Galaxy will build Macao's first high-tech amusement park. SJM Holdings will renovate its defunct floating casino to offer non-gaming entertainment options.

As the government works to usher in a new era the days of junkets bringing in high rollers to the island is all but finished. Crackdowns had curtailed that segment of the gaming business even before the pandemic began. This week the Macao secretary of finance and the gaming enforcement agency DICJ announced they will increase monitoring and enforcement around even stricter limits.

A rise in Covid infections around China caused November gaming revenue in Macao to fall 23% from October and plummet 99% from November 2019 pre-pandemic levels according to government data.

Even with the resumption of the e-visa program where Chinese travelers can apply electronically for travel documents and the easing of quarantine requirements the Macao government said it anticipates gross gaming revenue or GGR in 2023 to mirror 2022's GGR of roughly $16 billion as Macao struggles with continuing Covid overhang.

But Macao's loss may be Singapore's gain. Sands reported third-quarter results that showed a stunning jump in visitation and spending after Singapore lifted Covid travel restrictions.

Fitch estimates Singapore will achieve 80% of its pre-pandemic gaming revenue in 2022 and 95% in 2023.

RENO — When Tommy Ferraro was in grade school he got to follow his dad to work.

Unlike most of the other kids in his grade Ferraro’s follow-your-dad-to-work day saw him walking into the Nevada Legislature building on Carson Street in the capital. He was joined by his father Greg Ferraro who was the president of government and public affairs at R&R Partners at the time.

During his visit the younger Ferraro found himself seated next to then-Assembly Speaker Richard Perkins D-Henderson.

“I sat next to him with my made-up lobbyist’s badge that the front office made me and I got to watch and observe the proceedings in the early 2000s. And from that memory on I just knew I wanted to dive in” Ferraro said.

Having the opportunity to follow in a family member’s footsteps and carry on the legacy of their work is a dream many envision but few realize. In the Nevada political sphere however many have successfully taken up the helm and followed their parents into the world of lobbying.

Lobbyists advocate for the interests of their clients in an attempt to influence how lawmakers write pass and very often kill laws. Nearly all entities hire lobbyists from municipal governments to nonprofits to corporations and lobbyists often serve as a liaison between those groups and elected officials.

Even before joining his father’s firm the Ferraro Group becoming a lobbyist was Ferraro’s dream job since “Day 1.”

“I’ve kind of been in this world my entire life” he said. “My dad and I have always joked that like I’ve been learning this business this industry through osmosis. You don’t even know you’re learning it until you’re in it.”

Greg Ferraro formed the Ferraro Group in 2004 where he serves as president. The firm’s clients include Apple Cox Communications and the Las Vegas Raiders among others.

For the younger Ferraro — and many other second-generation lobbyists — exposure to Silver State politics and the Legislature started early.

Politicians at dinner

That’s true for John Sande IV who remembers legislators coming over to his house for dinner when he was a kid.

“I just remember from a very young age being fascinated when our schools would go on field trips to the Legislature and know that my father was a part of it” Sande said. “I just thought it was a really cool thing that he did and definitely had a lot of influence in my path” he said.

Sande a founding partner at Argentum Partners initially shied away from lobbying despite his interest to avoid any rumors of nepotism. After a few years he got his foot in the door and began lobbying during the 2007 legislative session.

Now-retired John Sande III formerly worked as an attorney at the well-known Jones Vargas law firm which later was absorbed by Fennemore Craig where he served as director. Among other groups the elder Sande represented the Nevada Franchised Auto Dealers Association a client that the younger Sande now represents at Argentum Partners.

The firm also represents several other clients most notably the Las Vegas Sands Corp. Grand Sierra Resort and the Southern Nevada Health District among others.

Nick Vassiliadis also remembers going to the Legislative Building with his father Billy Vassiliadis when he was a kid.

“Almost everything I know in terms of lobbying comes from him” he said.

Both Nick and Billy Vassiliadis work at R&R Partners where the senior Vassiliadis is partner and CEO. R&R Partners is one of the largest advertising and public affairs firms in the state and its government affairs division represents major interests including NV Energy the Nevada Resort Association and the Nevada Mining Association.

Roundabout paths

Others followed in their parents’ footsteps purely by a luck of the draw.

Jesse Wadhams who currently works at Black & Wadhams Law with his father James Wadhams started out in car sales after graduating college. After some time working in Washington D.C. and with the Nevada attorney general’s office he ended up at the same firm as his father where they represent clients including the Nevada Rural Electric Association Nevada Hospital Association and the Vegas Chamber.

For Nick Vander Poel the principal of Flynn Giudici Government Affairs following in his mom’s footsteps was never part of the plan. He ended up at the same firm as his mom Mendy Elliott at the end of the 2015 legislative session after several other stints in politics including working in former Gov. Jim Gibbons’ administration.

After working as a partner at Capitol Partners for over eight years Elliott left the firm and joined Flynn Giudici late last year where she serves as its senior vice president of regulatory affairs.

In a category all his own Will Adler began working with his father former Assemblyman Ernst “Ernie” Adler after starting his own firm. The younger Adler started Silver State Government Relations in 2017 a business that both his mother and father subsequently joined. Among the firm’s clients are the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245 and the Sierra Cannabis Coalition.

Even Adler who didn’t follow in his parents’ footsteps into the lobbying world grew up in a household where politics were a near constant topic of discussion.

“I would say just having it at a young age at the table really makes you understand the Nevada unique special sauce when it comes to legislation that truly can’t be taught. It has to be experienced to be passed on” he said.

Regan Comis on the other hand jumped into working with her father Keith Lee during the legislative session in 2009 after graduating from the University of Nevada Reno.

“One of the first things he told me was your word is the one thing you have going into that building and so you never break it” she said.

Lee works as a senior adviser at Tom Clark Solutions.

‘An advantage’ and a challenge

Sharing names with another well-known lobbyist has its perks beyond just mentorship and guidance.

Comis who currently works at R&R Partners said being “Keith’s daughter” definitely gave her an advantage early in her career.

“I think being a very young lobbyist people took meetings with me that maybe they wouldn’t have because they were doing so because that was Keith’s daughter” she said.

For Chase Whittemore a partner at Argentum Partners sharing Harvey Whittemore’s name added pressure but never made him nervous.

“I could call him anytime I wanted and ask him questions about how this works or how that legislative process works” he said. “Having my dad being a phone call away was a big benefit.”

Chase Whittemore began lobbying through an externship while at the Boyd Law School at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. He was able to jump into the experience in part because of contacts he had known his entire life through his father.

Harvey Whittemore was found guilty in 2013 of funneling over $133000 in unlawful contributions into then-U.S. Sen. Harry Reid’s 2007 re-election committee. Harvey Whittemore served 21 months of his two-year prison term and was released in 2016.

Despite the conviction Chase Whittemore said he was “honored” to be recognized by his father’s name.

“My dad made a mistake and he paid dearly for it serving the hardest 20 months he or my mother could have endured” Chase Whittemore said. “Anyone who knows and loves him believes that moment in time didn’t tarnish his professional legacy to say nothing of his philanthropic legacy of giving millions to the University of Nevada and charities throughout the state” he said in an emailed statement. “I’m beyond blessed that I get to be his son and I couldn’t be more proud of who he is.”

Sande — who doesn’t just share his dad’s last name but his entire name — said his father’s reputation helped him early in his career.

“My ability to work in Carson City as quickly as I was I’d be lying if I didn’t say that it had a large thing to do with my father’s reputation and his name” he said.

Despite his father’s success Sande said it wasn’t his family putting pressure on him but rather himself. One of the hardest things was making a name on his own which can be hard when you’re the fourth John Sande.

“I think (for) a lot of the lobbyist kids that’s kind of a challenge that we’ve all had to face in different ways. How do we carve a name for ourselves because you can only be John Sande’s kid for so long” he said.

The struggle to differentiate themselves from their parent isn’t the only difficulty facing those trying to break into the industry.

Nick Vassiliadis who said sharing his father’s name opened doors for him “1000 percent” said his name also brought heightened expectations.

“There was no doubt that it comes with advantages that newcomers with maybe an unknown last name doesn’t have. I’d also offer that it comes with also a much-heightened magnifying glass on what you’re doing than maybe what a person who was less well known is doing” he said.

Wadhams said despite there being “no question” that he benefited from his dad’s relationships and experience he still made an effort to approach the job from the ground up.

“While I may have gotten to start on second base I didn’t want to approach it that way. I wanted to start at the beginning right and sit in the committee room and take notes on the testimony” he said.

‘Which hat are we wearing?’

And working with a parent comes with its own difficulties too.

For Adler who works with both his mom and dad the relationship can be less than smooth.

“I’d say there’s great joy working with a parent but there’s always terrible hardships when it comes to ever trying to work with your parents. Try to tell your mom or dad what to do and see what happens and they almost immediately do the opposite of what you said” he said.

For the Vassiliadis family a few bumps in the road early on eventually gave way to a good rhythm in recent years.

“It can be difficult to navigate. Like which hat are we wearing? Are we father-son right now? Are we talking as friends or are we talking as employee-employer?” he said.

Nick Vassiliadis said he feels “very lucky” to work with his dad despite those early difficulties.

“I feel very lucky and very special that not only do I get to work for someone who’s considered the top of his field but he’s also my dad and he’s also my best friend” he said.

Vassiliadis said he doesn’t feel like he is living in his father’s shadow but instead feels “empowered” by him.

Bobby Ernaut who first started working at R&R Partners at 17 years old and was later hired by the firm after graduating from UNR said he wasn’t nervous to follow in the footsteps of his father. His dad Pete Ernaut serves as the chief government affairs officer at R&R Partners and is a former state assemblyman.

“It gives you a lot of confidence and pride knowing that he has come before you and he’s accomplished these great things he said. “Maybe for some people you’re worried that you will not ever really live up to the success of your predecessor but to me I just want to be a good steward of the legacy that he’s created and in my own fashion.”

US OKs Another Air-Breathing Missile Program Days After Tasting Success With ARRW,"Just days after the United States successfully tested a hypersonic air-to-ground missile prototype another hypersonic project codenamed ‘Mayhem’ which has remained cloaked in secrecy has taken off the ground.

The Pentagon announced on December 16 that the US Air Force (USAF) awarded a $334 million contract for Project “Mayhem” to Leidos to develop a platform for hypersonic weapons and sensors. Leidos was chosen nine months after the Air Force Research Laboratory formally released its solicitation.

Project Mayhem aims to create a hypersonic air-breathing system with a bigger payload capacity than the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) besides a capability to conduct both strike and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (IRS) missions.

For perspective the AGM-183A ARRW is a long-range hypersonic missile developed for the US Air Force. The weapon will boost the USAF’s strike capability at stand-off ranges allowing it to attack heavily defended targets. It is expected to be officially deployed by 2023.

Even though very little information has been divulged about the program we do know that it intends to build the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) among other things for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Leidos will use digital and model-based systems engineering according to the press release based on an Air Force strategy that increasingly prioritizes digital engineering weapons development as a way to speed up development and improve design precision.

According to a press statement from Leidos a $24 million contract was awarded for the first stage of the Mayhem project which involved reviewing the system requirements and the conceptual design. Initial work will be funded with roughly $8.7 million from the 2022 budget for research development testing and evaluation.

What Do We Know About Project Mayhem?

According to the contract award release published recently Mayhem is focused on “delivering a bigger class air-breathing hypersonic system capable of completing numerous missions with a standardized payload interface enabling a substantial technological advancement and future capability.

A standardized protocol-based electronic interface allows data to be exchanged between the weapon system and the aircraft’s weapon system management and control computer. An aircraft can carry different types of weapons. A standardized interface would allow aircraft sensors to set navigation and targeting data on the weapon system before launch.

In a rendering released by Leidos which can be seen below an unmanned hypersonic air vehicle with a single engine and a sizable air intake under the fuselage could be seen. It has an overall fuselage design that is relatively long and narrow has delta-shaped wings and a single vertical tail. However this is merely an impression and could be far from the actual design.

In December last year the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) posted online a contract document that noted: “The potential of viable multi-cycle designs is hugely significant for both weapons and aircraft concepts and unlike existing hypersonic projects — it could produce a vessel that is capable of hypersonic flight and could land afterward making it reusable.”

Explaining the concept without giving away specific details the document added “While this development would be more significant for hypersonic aircraft it would also have utility for hypersonic missiles — providing them with the capability to adjust between speeds depending on mission requirements.”

The document further stated that the system goal was to deliver payloads five times the mass and double the range of existing technology-capable systems. The standardized payload interface would make it possible to integrate different payloads into one hypersonic system in several ways.

It also stated three desired payloads for the Mayhem vehicle only one of which would be carried at once. The three payloads were two associated with the strike mission set and one for “responsive” ISR. The sole descriptions of the strike payloads were “area effect” and “large unitary.”

At the time defense writer Joseph Trevithick deconstructed it and said the desire for discrete “area effect” and “large unitary” type payloads strongly suggests that the first one imagines a payload of cluster munitions or something similar such as a swarm of tiny drones.

Although it would have a unitary design an advanced high-explosive fragmentation warhead would produce an “area effect.” The expert noted that “large unitary” may also refer to larger warheads with multiple impacts against a single target such as deep penetrating capabilities against bunkers and other fortified structures.

The service has previously compared the Mayhem endeavor to a hybrid between an air-breathing hypersonic weapon and a full-fledged hypersonic aircraft. Mayhem was earlier believed to be “focused at least in part on acquiring testbeds to support work on advanced high-speed jet engines like the ones that have reportedly been in development for proposed hypersonic aircraft such as Lockheed Martin’s SR-72.”

Due to the program’s secrecy there are speculations that the first version of the experimental Mayhem vehicle might serve as a test bed for a more durable hypersonic aircraft with a cutting-edge multi-mode propulsion system.

The Mayhem Program could be expected to significantly bolster US hypersonic capabilities in the long run. The US has trailed behind Russia and China regarding hypersonic weapons but is rapidly catching up. All three of its services are preparing to deploy their respective hypersonic weapons.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhzdG9kYXkudXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvaW5kdXN0cnktbmV3cy9kYXJieS1sYWpveWUtam9pbnMtbGVpZG9zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hstoday Former TSA Executive Assistant Administrator for Security Operations Darby LaJoye Joins Leidos - HS Today,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhzdG9kYXkudXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvaW5kdXN0cnktbmV3cy9kYXJieS1sYWpveWUtam9pbnMtbGVpZG9zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024DFE568A00>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The fact that such a restriction even seems possible is viewed as progress by some.

“It makes me optimistic about the future” said Chris DeScherer an attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center's Charleston office.

Council and stakeholders met recently to discuss proposed restrictions on the building method that can worsen damage from floods. The method is increasingly popular among Charleston developers building in low-lying areas including islands where the city's fastest growth is happening.

Johns Island was cited as ground zero for this practice as well as the reason it is so risky.

The method is a low-cost way to reach a certain height above sea level: pile up dirt from elsewhere pour concrete on top and build to code from there. The vast majority of slab-built developments involve clearcutting trees from the property. Critics have long complained that such construction puts Charleston homebuyers and their neighbors at additional flood risk.

The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Authority took a stand against the building practice in 2009 discouraging its use for most coastal homes. The method however is still legal.

Slab-on-grade is one of many problematic uses of dirt fill at construction sites in low-laying areas. “Fill and build” is the overarching term for multiple dirt-laying practices that elevate land. In Charleston long-term flooding issues in and around new developments using ""fill and build"" is common. Harry Griffin a former councilman had previously called for an outright ban on such development.

The current proposal is restricted to the slab-on-grade issue. If passed it would ban the practice for single-family residential homes within the city's 100-year flood plain.",,,,,,,,,,,,

LONDON - Europe's car repair and spare parts industry is calling for a rewrite of EU competition rules arguing they allow carmakers and franchise dealers to disadvantage independent operators.

The European Commission has recommended extending 2010's Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation (MVBER) for five years when it expires in 2023 with some supplementary guidelines.

In January European Union members are due to discuss the future of the rule which has become another front in a growing struggle for access to and control of car data as the EU is already working on laws governing access to in-vehicle data.

Proponents of a rewrite say automakers restrict access to vehicle data which can make repairs more expensive while also dictating how repairs should be undertaken and with which parts.

""In the last 10 years things have changed dramatically the rules of the game are no longer the same"" said Alex Gelbcke chief executive of spare parts provider Fource.

""The regulation deserves an in-depth refresh and if that does not happen we will all suffer"" added Gelbcke whose company covers the Benelux countries and France. Fource's parent company LKQ Corp has annual turnover in Europe of around 6 billion euros ($6.4 billion).

Sylvia Gotzen CEO of the International Federation of Automotive Aftermarket Distributors which is part of a broader alliance of repair shops and parts makers that employs 3.5 million people in Europe also called for changes.

""Car manufacturers sit on that data like a chicken on eggs"" she said adding that this makes carmakers ""masters and gate-keepers for the entire repair process"".

A spokesperson for the Commission said its evaluation had shown ""there had been no material developments in the last decade that would justify a major revision of the regime.""

""However the evaluation revealed that an update was necessary to reflect the importance that access to vehicle-generated data is likely to have as a factor of competition.""

The Commission needs to make a decision before the current MVBER expires on May 31 2023.

The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) said it supports the commission's approach.

""If the Commission has decided not to change the rules we assume that the complaints made by the independent aftermarket were not sufficiently substantiated"" a spokeswoman said.

Critics also complain automakers have increasingly relied on the use of ""captive parts"" which include software coding that often can only be accessed by franchise dealers.

Neil Pattemore technical director of Britain's Independent Automotive Aftermarket Federation (IAAF) said to replace headlights on some newer models requires a code or brake pads have QR codes but only branded dealers have access to them.

Britain's Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed changes to its MVBER that addresses some aftermarket complaints including using clearer language in vehicle warranties that consumers can use independent repairers without losing benefits.

Major European carmakers including Stellantis and Renault did not respond to requests for comment.

Volkswagen said the current regulation ""is still fit for purpose"" but it also supports the Commission's approach to supplementary guidelines that would enable access for independent operators to ""vehicle-generated data to the extent that such data is essential for repair and maintenance.""

NASA has canceled the GeoCarb mission which was a collaboration with the University of Oklahoma and Lockheed Martin that intended to put a greenhouse gas –monitoring satellite into geostationary orbit. GeoCarb would have measured levels of carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and methane in the atmosphere about 4 million times per day. The mission was selected by NASA in 2016.

""Decisions like this are difficult but NASA is dedicated to making careful choices with the resources provided by the people of the United States"" Thomas Zurbuchen NASA's associate administrator for science said in a statement . ""We look forward to accomplishing our commitment to state-of-the-art climate observation in a more efficient and cost-effective way.""

According to NASA's statement the decision to end GeoCarb was due to ""technical concerns cost performance and availability of new alternative data sources."" The most recent anticipated cost of GeoCarb was $600 million much higher than the mission's original $170.9 million estimate.

As for those new data sources they include the new Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument that arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) in July as well as the mission extension of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 instrument that began work in 2019 also aboard the ISS.

NASA is also working on the Earth System Observatory  a series of Earth-focused satellites due to launch by 2030. The satellites will study aerosols clouds surface biology and geology and surface deformation and change among other areas of research.

Congress is on track in the coming week to give final approval to a national military budget for the current fiscal year that is expected to reach approximately $858 billion — or $45 billion above what President Biden had requested.

If approved at this level the Pentagon budget will have grown at 4.3 percent per year over the last two years — even after inflation — compared with an average of less than 1 percent a year in real dollars between 2015 and 2021 according to an analysis by Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments for The New York Times.

THE BEST FACES SHOW YOU'VE LIVED A LIFE

My husband Danny and I have been together for 27 years. We're both creatives so it's not like either one of us is a business person who understands spreadsheets. It can be quite hairy.

At one point in 2009 after Supergrass split up and I stopped my band times were tough. It was before I set up my design business and we couldn't put petrol in the car. Yet we got through that and built our life back up. I'm grateful because it taught me how to survive and shield the kids.

Designer and former Britpop singer Pearl Lowe 52 lives in Somerset and East Sussex with her musician husband Danny Goffey 48

We've got another two years before the empty nest so it feels mad that we're going to be grandparents in April as my eldest daughter Daisy is pregnant. My mum was the most amazing grandma. I was 18 when I had Daisy so she'd often look after her for the weekend. And I'm sure Daisy's going to ask the same of me. I'm determined to be a fun grandma.

Ageing isn't easy but in my 50s I've learned the power of trust. I am a bit of a control freak but you need to just trust that everything will work out.

Work makes me really happy. It can be quite dangerous when I'm not creating because I can get depressed. I'm an addict. I've come through addiction to drugs — I got clean 17 years ago. Now I've got my tools and I know what works to keep my head above water.

I feel sorry for women our age who face pressure to have surgery. They all look the same and actually they just look weird — I'd rather look old than weird. I like women whose faces show that they've lived a life.

Best to grow old gracefully — and maybe not look in the mirror quite so much.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLWVuZ2xhbmQtYmlybWluZ2hhbS02NDAxMzg2N9IBPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLWVuZ2xhbmQtYmlybWluZ2hhbS02NDAxMzg2Ny5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jack Lowe death: Police arrest 15-year-old over stabbing,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bbc.co.uk', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/uk-england-birmingham-64013867 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024DFDFE02E0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLWVuZ2xhbmQtYmlybWluZ2hhbS02NDAxMzg2N9IBPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLWVuZ2xhbmQtYmlybWluZ2hhbS02NDAxMzg2Ny5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

NEOM

Malcolm Aw said he pulled out of a Neom contract because of alleged Saudi human rights abuses.

The CEO of Solar Water told BI that he had planned to build solar desalination plants.

Human rights campaigners say tribe members are being forcibly evicted to make way for the megacity.

A green energy founder pulled out of a $100 million Neom contract after he realized that the Saudis were bulldozing villages to make way for the megacity.

Malcolm Aw the CEO and founder of Solar Water told Business Insider that he initially got involved with Neom to help realize its ambitions as a pioneering green energy ""eco-city.""

Neom is the centerpiece of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 project to diversify the Saudi economy away from fossil fuels and transform it into a luxury tourism destination and innovation hub.

However Aw said he was so appalled at reports of human rights abuses that he canceled the Neom contract in 2022 despite having already built some of his desalination plants there.

""They just they bulldoze their way right through villages and everything which is just unbelievable"" said Aw.

Aw spoke to BI after BBC News reported that an exiled Saudi colonel said Saudi Arabia authorized the use of lethal force to clear the way for its Neom desert megacity.

Col Rabih Alenezi said he was ordered to evict people living on the land to make way for a part of the project called The Line . The area was mostly populated by the Huwaitat tribe.

The BBC said it was not able to independently verify Alenezi's comments about lethal force.

However satellite images analyzed by the BBC showed three villages including schools and hospitals were destroyed to make way for Neom.

One of the villagers Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti was later reportedly killed by Saudi authorities said the UN.

""What it tried to do is turn the whole province into Dubai or Qatar or something but in doing so they are clearing the people who have been there for years out of the area"" said Aw.

""These people could be such a contribution to this whole development. You know the villages have all been removed.""







Aw who is a descendant of Tiger Balm founder Aw Boon Haw told BI that he had initially been drawn to work on the Neom project because of its commitment to green energy and ecology.

Aw's company uses solar energy for desalination while most desalination plants burn fossil fuels and have been found to pollute oceans. Neom had offered Aw's company Solar Water $100m for exclusive rights to use his technology.

Neom's planners say they want to be an""eco-city"" with the signature project ""The Line"" — a vertical mirrored skyscraper cutting through the desert — running on 100% renewable energy and 95% of the land preserved for nature. They claim to be committed to ""respecting existing communities and cultural heritage within our region.""

But Aw believes the promises are not being fulfilled and planners are performing a U-turn on their original vision for the city.

""What they're doing is not ethical and what they're doing is they're creating an exclusivity to house wealthy people in a wealthy touristic area. But that wasn't the original idea. The idea was to develop a green scenario"" he said.

""The whole idea we came in is to make the place green and for the people the local people the indigenous who have been there for ages for yonks to be able to share into development"" said Aw. ""But then they change course. Suddenly they are totally different from what we expect to do and in doing so they have done a lot of damage.""

Neom declined to comment on Aw's claims. The Saudi embassy in the UK did not respond to a request for comment.

Saudi Arabia has been trying to quell public criticism about its Vision 2030 plans .

Last year BI reported that the crackdown extended to those criticizing the evictions on social media with Fatima al-Shawarbi sentenced to 30 years in prison for speaking out.

The project has been beset by problems in recent months with costs spiraling to an estimated $1 trillion and key projects delayed or cut back. In April Bloomberg reported that Saudi officials were reducing the number of people expected to be living in Neom from around one million to 300000 by 2030. The report also said the length of The Line could be cut from around 100 miles to one mile.

Aw urged planners to stand by their original ethical and ecological vision.

""You know we have the technology to solve the [green energy] problem that people are complaining about today. Absolutely. Absolutely. But there's just not the vision or the ethical commitment"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM4OTIvdmVyaXpvbi10bW9iaWxlLWF0dC11bmxpbWl0ZWQtcGxhbi1mcmVlLXBob25lLW9mZmVycy1maW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile's “unlimited” plans just got a $10M slap on the wrist,"Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile will pay a combined $10.22 million to a group of states to settle claims that the carriers lied to customers about their “unlimited” plans and “free” phone offers. The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Orbits $52M-$55M Opening – Friday PM Box Office Update,"FRIDAY AFTERNOON: Knock on wood but this summer release looks to be meeting its tracking projections.

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzEwL2dvcmRvbi1yYW1zYXlzLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtZW1waXJlLXRyaXBsZWQtbG9zc2VzLXRvLTM0bS1sYXN0LXllYXLSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8xMC9nb3Jkb24tcmFtc2F5cy1yZXN0YXVyYW50LWVtcGlyZS10cmlwbGVkLWxvc3Nlcy10by0zNG0tbGFzdC15ZWFy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant empire tripled losses to £3.4m last year,"Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant empire tripled losses to £3.4m last year as it spent millions of pounds on opening five new restaurants and the chef said businesses in the industry were “battling to stay afloat”.

Sales at the celebrity chef’s dining establishments which range from his Michelin-starred flagship Restaurant Gordon Ramsay to Street Burger rose by 21% to £95.6m in the year to 27 August. The group took on 290 more staff after a tough time during the pandemic lockdowns.

However pre-tax losses rose to £3.4m from £1.05m a year before after £4.9m of one-off costs the vast majority of which related to pre-opening costs for new restaurants including a Lucky Cat outlet in Manchester a Bread Street Kitchen outlet in Battersea power station and a Street Pizza outlet in Edinburgh.

Ramsay also bought the Shoreditch eatery Pizza East. Underlying earnings excluding one-off costs tax and write-downs rose to £8.3m from £6.2m.

While losses worsened during the year they still mark a turnaround from the pandemic which brought Ramsay’s business operations to a halt and forcing him to cut almost 300 jobs amid £12m in losses.

Ramsay said: “It’s been a really hard-fought year but at the same time an exciting year and in tough times it amazes me how strong and vibrant our industry is. It’s challenging out there and businesses are battling to stay afloat rising costs rent and food costs multiple strikes. It’s a battle.

“However I genuinely don’t think there’s been a year since I opened my first restaurant in 1998 where there has been so much passion and vibrancy in our industry.

“People still want to go out break bread and have a good time together. We’ve still got something wonderful to celebrate and I truly believe the industry has never been so exciting.”

Ramsay who opened his first solo venture Gordon Ramsay at Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea in 1998 said he was on track to surpass £100m of sales this year.

He intends to opens five new restaurants within London’s new skyscraper 22 Bishopsgate – including Lucky Cat and its roof terrace on level 60 making it the capital’s highest restaurant.

The development will also include an outpost of Bread Street Kitchen and Bar and a 14-seat chef’s table from Restaurant Gordon Ramsay the chef’s Michelin-starred Chelsea venue and the Gordon Ramsay Academy where culinary enthusiasts can hone their skills.

Ramsay said: “This is more than just a new opening – it’s a significant milestone for our business. We’re not only launching the highest culinary experiences in London but also creating a vibrant culinary hub at the incredible 22 Bishopsgate.”

Ramsay also has an academy in Woking Surrey where the accounts note the local council loaned his group more than £1.6m in 2021 repayable over 25 years at 3.5% to help with the fit-out of the venture and its neighbouring Street Burger restaurant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3MvdmEtaW1wcm9wZXJseS1hcHByb3ZlZC0xMW0tYm9udXNlcy1zZW5pb3ItZXhlY3V0aXZlcy13YXRjaGRvZy9zdG9yeT9pZD0xMTAwODE1NjnSAXRodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9Qb2xpdGljcy92YS1pbXByb3Blcmx5LWFwcHJvdmVkLTExbS1ib251c2VzLXNlbmlvci1leGVjdXRpdmVzLXdhdGNoZG9nL3N0b3J5P2lkPTExMDA4MTU2OQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VA improperly approved almost $11M in bonuses to senior executives watchdog says,"Some have challenged having to pay the money back an inspector general said.

VA improperly approved almost $11M in bonuses to senior executives watchdog says

Department of Veterans Affairs officials improperly approved nearly $11 million in bonuses to senior executives intended for other workers a department watchdog said in a new report.

The money was recently allocated by Congress and intended to be used to recruit ""critical skill"" employees but ended up in the hands of senior executives in the VA's central Washington office according to an inspector general's report posted Thursday.

The funds authorized by the Pact Act were meant to be incentives in hiring and retaining specialists needed to process billion in new benefits for veterans dealing with health issues from being exposed to burn pits. Agent Orange and other toxic hazards.

In this May 10 2013 file photo the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) seal is shown at the headquarters in Washington D.C. Bloomberg via Getty Images FILE

The IG report said the money was paid instead as bonuses to more than 180 senior executives last year with several taking home more than $100000.

The average bonus paid out was over $55000 the report said.

The Washington Post first reported the results of the inspector general's investigation.

The IG said the improperly approved bonuses were due in part to breakdowns in leadership and controls at multiple levels of the VA.

The IG recommended the ""Secretary of Veterans Affairs or his designee takes appropriate action to determine whether individuals involved in the decision-making process ... had any actual or apparent conflicts of interest and develop a process to ensure all decision-makers are free from conflicts when awarding future incentives.""

When Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough in September ordered the executives to return the money most did or agreed to do so but 19 have challenged having to repay the bonuses the IG report said."

Here Are 3 Top Stocks to Buy Now.,"Oil prices might be down but several catalysts could push crude higher in the coming year.

Crude oil prices started off the year red hot. Oil prices rallied from less than $80 a barrel to more than $125 a barrel following Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. However crude has cooled off considerably since this summer steadily falling back into the low $80s on macroeconomic concerns. That more than 20% plunge in crude oil prices means oil is in a bear market.

However a new bull market for oil looks to be coming next year. Here's why crude seems set to rebound which could fuel big gains for oil stocks.

Wall Street is very bullish on oil

Most oil market analysts believe oil prices are going much higher next year. For example Jeff Currie the global head of commodities for venerable investment bank Goldman Sachs has a $110 forecast for Brent oil (the global benchmark price) in 2023. Rival investment bank Morgan Stanley agrees expecting Brent to top the $110 a-barrel mark by the middle of next year. While others aren't quite as bullish the consensus is that oil prices will rebound in 2023.

Analysts note several catalysts that should fuel crude's rebound in 2023. Morgan Stanley summed it up in a note to clients. The bank wrote ""We remain constructive on oil prices driven by recovering demand (China reopening aviation recovering) amid constrained supply due to low levels of investment risks to Russia supply the end of SPR releases and slowdown of U.S. shale.""

The biggest catalyst is China. ""The pent-up demand out of China is going to be enormous"" according to comments by Energy Aspects director of research Amrita Sen in The Wall Street Journal. Sen believes ""that could swing demand by at least a million barrels a day and that could easily make the difference between an oil price forecast of $95 to $105 versus $120 to $130.""

Meanwhile most oil companies plan to continue keeping a relatively firm lid on investment spending and output. For example while oil giant Chevron (CVX 0.22%) plans to boost its capital budget by 25% next year to $17 billion most of that increase is due to inflation and a ramp in lower-carbon investment spending. Likewise even though ExxonMobil (XOM -0.41%) plans to boost capital spending from $22 billion this year to $23 billion-$25 billion in 2023 it expects its production will remain flat at around 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. With demand poised to rise amid continued tight supplies oil prices seem primed to rally.

A boon for oil stocks

This outlook for higher oil prices bodes well for oil companies in 2023. It will enable them to continue producing strong earnings and cash flow. Meanwhile with most oil companies limiting investment spending they'll have more money to return to their shareholders via buybacks and dividends.

Oil giants Chevron and ExxonMobil are well positioned to capitalize on higher crude oil prices next year. However three other producers stand out as even more compelling buys right now. One of them is Marathon Oil (MRO -2.21%). It trades at a bottom-of-the-barrel valuation compared to its peers (the higher the free cash flow (FCF) yield the lower the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio):

Because of that Marathon Oil has been using its oil-fueled windfall this year to gobble up its dirt cheap stock. The oil company has already retired 20% of its outstanding shares. It also used its oil-fueled cash flows to buy Ensign Natural Resources for $3 billion. That deal will boost its free cash flow by 15% assuming recent oil prices and by an even greater percentage if oil prices soar. That deal could give Marathon more fuel to buy back stock next year.

Diamondback Energy (FANG -0.75%) is another dirt cheap oil stock. That's a big reason it offers investors a high dividend yield which is currently over 6.5%. The other reason is its variable dividend strategy. What's noteworthy is that Diamondback has shifted its capital allocation strategy over the past quarter paying out a lower variable dividend so it can buy back more of its shares. The company could continue to pay a big-time dividend and gobble up more of its stock next year. It's in an even better position to capitalize on higher oil prices after recently agreeing to spend $3.3 billion to buy two cash-gushing oil companies. Those deals position it to produce even more free cash next year.

Finally analysts see a nearly 60% upside potential in Devon Energy (DVN -1.44%). They point to its strong balance sheet extensive drilling inventory and variable dividend framework. Another upside catalyst is that Devon recently closed two deals that it expects will boost its cash flow by 25% in the fourth quarter. Those acquisitions put it in an even better position to capitalize on higher oil prices next year.

High-upside oil stocks

Oil appears primed to rally sharply in 2023. While higher prices would benefit all oil stocks Marathon Diamondback and Devon stand out as best positioned to capitalize on higher crude prices. All three recently made cash-gushing acquisitions which could give them even more money to buy back their cheap stocks and pay dividends. That makes them the top oil stocks to buy heading into 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Hyatt Regency LAX was sold out and my last two stays at the Ritz-Carlton Marina del Rey were disappointing (the Hyatt Regency LAX was better even).

Hotel June is a less upscale brand from Proper hotels (see for instance the Santa Monica Proper which I thought was gorgeous). The West LA property has 250 rooms. Both are part of the Design Hotels brand which is owned by Marriott but only partially-participating in Bonvoy. Upgrades are supposed to be available for instance but Suite Night Awards are not.

The hotel has a view of LAX airport operations with the ocean in the distance. It’s less than a 10 minute drive to the airport but more a city than airport hotel (for instance no shuttle).

At check-in I was proactively offered 4 p.m. late checkout based on Bonvoy status. I was not offered a complimentary upgrade though an entry-level suite was available. I had asked about the upgrade in advance and was quoted $115++. At check-in I was told they had a note that I wanted to upgrade to a suite – and it was available if I still wanted it at $115? Traveling with my wife and daughter and wanting a sofa bed in the living room I accepted. Off an overwater flight with family that worked.

The hotel public spaces are very attractive from the lobby area to the pool across from the hotel’s entrance.

The room however was highly functional but not attractive. And service was lacking. Since my daughter was going to sleep on the sofa bed I needed bedding. I called down to request it. An hour later it hadn’t arrived so I followed up. They were going to ‘prioritize it’ but another hour later still nothing. On our way out to dinner I asked at the front desk for it emphasized how much I needed it before we returned in order to do bedtime and with the third request we did see the bedding next to the sofa when we came back to the room (they didn’t make up the bed).

In terms of the room itself I think the best description is spartan. There was limited artwork on the walls. There was furniture but it reminded me of a cross between what I had in my dorm room at UCLA and my first apartment. The base boards were in poor condition carpeting was rough and cheap and coming up in the corners.

Here’s the bedroom.

And the living room.

The bathrooms were fine tiled and offered Aesop amenities (great!). Water pressure was very low. There was hair on one of the bath towels.

And the view from the room. My daughter loved watching planes line up to land and touch down.

Ultimately I got a good night’s sleep. The hotel has coffee in the lobby starting at 5am.

The property usually runs 30000 – 35000 Marriott points and is average value against its room rates. (I’m told the hotel receives $73 from Bonvoy.) In addition Marriott lets hotels bill you extra charges when you redeem and in this case Hotel June West LA adds a $17.43 destination fee and a separate $5.98 “wellness fee” neither of which were explained by the hotel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdGVscy1hbmQtcmVzb3J0cy9lZGl0aW9uLWhvdGVscy1leHBhbmRpbmctdG8tbWV4aWNvLW90aGVyLXRvcC1kZXN0aW5hdGlvbnMtaW4tMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EDITION Hotels Expanding to Mexico Other Top Destinations in 2023,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelpulse.com/news/hotels-and-resorts/edition-hotels-expanding-to-mexico-other-top-destinations-in-2023 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdGVscy1hbmQtcmVzb3J0cy9lZGl0aW9uLWhvdGVscy1leHBhbmRpbmctdG8tbWV4aWNvLW90aGVyLXRvcC1kZXN0aW5hdGlvbnMtaW4tMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdpcmVzLmNvbS9raGF5YmFyLXZvbGNhbm8tY2FtcC1pcy1ub3ctb3Blbi1pbi1zYXVkaS1hcmFiaWHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Khaybar Volcano Camp is Now Open in Saudi Arabia,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.travelwires.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /khaybar-volcano-camp-is-now-open-in-saudi-arabia (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024DFDC3F3D0>, 'Connection to www.travelwires.com timed out.

If you currently are — or in the past have been — a Chase Sapphire Reserve® cardholder then you’re likely already familiar with Lyft Pink as it was previously a complimentary benefit for cardholders.

Now that it is no longer a complimentary perk many will wonder whether a Lyft Pink membership is actually worth it.

Here’s a look at what the new Lyft Pink program has to offer subscribers.

New Lyft Pink and Lyft Pink All Access Benefits

For $9.99 per month or $99 per year Lyft Pink subscribers will receive the following benefits:

Cancellation forgiveness cancel up to 3 times per month for free

In-app roadside assistance for your own car free up to 4 times a year

Free bike or scooter unlock each month

Free SIXT car rental upgrades

Save on food delivery with Grubhub+

The most interesting benefits appear to be that you can save at least 5% on select rides get free priority pickup and receive up to 3 free cancellations per year which usually cost $5 per cancellation. Further if you’re already a Grubhub+ subscriber or would find value in a Grubhub+ subscription then Lyft Pink might be a no-brainer for you as it includes a complimentary Grubhub+ subscription — a savings of $9.99 each month.

Washington DC — Cybastion an emerging leader in the field of cybersecurity took centre stage at side events of the U.S. - Africa Leaders Summit. The cybersecurity firm was also the platinum sponsor for the US - Africa Business Forum event. (USABF)

The USABF event took place on the Summit's second day (December 14). It was hosted by the White House the U.S. Department of Commerce the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Corporate Council on Africa in partnership with the Prosper Africa initiative.

Speaking at the USABF event on Wednesday President Biden announced over $15 billion in two-way trade and investment commitments deals and partnerships that advance key priorities including sustainable energy health systems agribusiness digital connectivity infrastructure and finance. He said ""Altogether the forum has spurred more than $15 billion in new deals which will turn lift up and improve lives of people all across the continent. And that's the biggest deal of all.""

President Biden also announced a new initiative the Digital Transformation with Africa (DTA). A signature initiative of the Biden-Harris Administration DTA will expand digital access and literacy and strengthen digital enabling environments across the continent. He said ""We are working with Congress to invest $350 million to facilitate more than almost half a billion dollars in financing to make sure more people across Africa can participate in the digital economy.""

And in a major coup for Cybastion the President went on to mention Cybastion in his speech saying ""Cisco Systems and Cybastion a diaspora-owned small business is jointly announcing $800 million in new contracts to protect African countries from cyber threats.""

Some of the deals President Biden refers to were signed at the Summit with Cybastion signing deals with four African countries Cote d'Ivoire Benin Burkina Faso and Congo and Coris Bank.

When the Indian players and the team management went back to the dugout after losing the third Women’s T20I against Australia on Wednesday they zeroed in on a couple of areas that cost the side the game.

As captain Harmanpreet Kaur pointed out the team played “too many dot balls” - 56 to be specific. And adding to its woes the middle-order fumbled under pressure and lost wickets in quick succession to surrender to the mighty Aussies leading to the home team going down 1-2 in the five-match T20I series. Now with the series on the line India needs to fix the loose ends when it squares off against Australia in the fourth T20I at the Brabourne Stadium on Saturday.

This wicket at the iconic venue is not similar to the one at the DY Patil Stadium which hosted the first couple of games. With bowlers enjoying good swing on this surface things have been slightly difficult for the batters to get going but a star-studded Indian batting line-up comprising Smriti Mandhana Shafali Verma Jemimah Rodrigues and captain Harmanpreet need to ensure that they are consistent in their starts. So far in the series the opening pair of Shafali and Smriti haven’t been able to hold on to the starts and now with the series in a crucial juncture it is important to ensure that they play calculatingly ensuring that there are not too many dot balls.

In the first three matches Jemimah Rodrigues has struggled adding pressure to the middle-order and ahead of what could be the series-deciding fixture the team management needs to decide on whether they want to continue with Jemimah at No.3 or tweak their batting line-up to make sure that the pressure does not mount up towards the end.

In her interaction with the media after losing the third game Harmanpreet had stressed on the need to finish off a game and being the leader and the most experienced member of the side she has to lead from the front and guide the team out of the woods in crunch games. In the last few games Deepti Sharma and Richa Ghosh have played the roles of the finisher but going forward it is a must for the team to have a ‘Plan B’ in a bid to shrug off the over-reliance on Deepti and Richa at the fag end.

​

Just not batting bowling has been an area of concern in the series as all three games have had scores above 170. In the first game India failed to defend 172 while conceding 187 and 172 in the second and third outings respectively. Harmanpreet admitted that even though the team does not have a bowling coach the players are taking charge. “I know we are missing a bowling coach but our bowlers are taking charge. They are participative in bowlers’ meetings. They have full responsibility and today [it was] all their plans and they were leading the way I was just supporting them in the middle” she said.

With the selectors looking beyond Shikha Pandey Renuka Singh Thakur has been given the role of India’s pace spearhead but she hasn’t been quite consistent so far in the tournament and going forward the bowling unit needs to step up against the Alyssa Healy-led Aussies.

Aiming for another series victory against India the visiting team will pin its hopes on Beth Mooney Tahlia McGrath and Ellyse Perry while hoping for captain Healy to regain her rhythm.

Mooney and McGrath have accelerated the top-order while once the seasoned Perry once again stamped her class with a 75 off 47 deliveries in the third game. She had to warm the bench for the entire leg of the Ashes in January this year. With the team opting for aggressive power-hitters she was sidelined for the Commonwealth Games as well.

While those omissions led to questions over her future the sudden retirement of Rachael Haynes seems to have opened new doors for Perry and the Australian team management will be hoping for her to keep the momentum going in the remainder of the series.

With plenty at stake both the teams have lots to play for.

Lionel Messi scored twice in the final as he claimed the one trophy missing from his collection in his stellar career.

Messi put Argentina ahead from the penalty spot to become the first man to score in each of the knockout stages since the first round of 16 at Mexico 1986.

Angel Di Maria made it 2-0 but Mbappe scored twice in the space of two minutes late in the second half - the first from the spot - to force extra time.

Messi scored in the second half of extra time but France won a penalty with Mbappe converting again to make it 3-3 and take the game into penalties.

Mbappe and Messi both scored their respective team's openers in the shoot-outs but Emiliano Martinez was the hero again for 'La Albiceleste'.

The Aston Villa goalkeeper saved from Kingsley Coman before Aurelien Tchouamani shot wide with Paulo Dybala and Leandro Paredes both successful.

And it was Gonzalo Montiel who shot home to secure Argentina a 4-2 shoot-out victory and glory at the first World Cup since the death of Diego Maradona who led them to the 1986 title.

Argentina's first World Cup success came on home soil at 1978.

Argentina's road to the final

Argentina got off to a rough start at the World Cup after a surprising opening game loss to Saudi Arabia. Messi was the lone goal scorer for his team but it wasn't enough as they fell 2-1.

The squad rebounded against Mexico with a 2-0 victory with Messi and Enzo Fernandez finding the back of the net in the second period.

They scored a decisive victory against Poland on Wednesday (30 November) with their 2-0 win sending them into the round of 16.

The Albiceleste were in command for most of their match against Australia with Messi and Julian Alvarez scoring goals in the 35th and 57th minutes respectively. Australia made a late push when they scored 77 minutes into play but ultimately Argentina prevailed.

Then the squad survived a thriller 9 December against a Dutch team that had not lost in more than a year to advance to the semi-final. It was 2-2 through extra time with Argentina taking it 4-3 on penalties.

La Albiceleste seemed to be cruising having taken a 2-0 lead off goals from Nahuel Molina (35') and Messi (73' P).

But then Wout Weghorst scored - twice. First in the 83rd minute and then heroically with just seconds remaining in regulation play (90+11').

Messi and his team were aggressive during the 30 minutes of extra play that followed but failed to take the lead. The match went to a shootout where the superstar set the tone with an easy first goal. But a miss from Enzo Fernandez in the fourth spot meant the drama woud continue all the way through to the fifth and final shot from Lautaro Martinez.

Martinez held his nerve and kept Argentina in the global tournament.

In the semi-finals Argentina cruised to a 3-0 win over Croatia.

Messi opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 34th minute to take him to 11 World Cup goals one ahead of the previous national record held by Gabriel Batistuta.

Five minutes later Julian Alvarez made it two as Argentina went into the break 2-0 to the good.

And with 20 minutes to go Messi went on a mesmerising run before setting up Alvarez for his second of the night to kill any hopes of a Croatian comeback..

At his fifth World Cup Messi 35 has finally achieved his dream having collected a runners-up medal at Brazil 2014.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9iaWctc2hvZXMtdG8tZmlsbC1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stdGFsa3Mtd2VhcmluZy1kYXZpZC1kZWNhc3Ryb3Mtbm8tNjYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Big Shoes To Fill:' Mason McCormick Talks Wearing No. 66,"Though he’s been a Steeler for barely two weeks Mason McCormick knows the reputation that comes along with his new jersey number. Wearing No. 66 David DeCastro’s and Alan Faneca’s old numbers McCormick told reporters he’s fully aware of the legacy he’s replacing. At least in number.

“I have heard a little bit about it” he told reporters via Steelers.com when asked about his jersey digits. “I heard I got some big shoes to fill. And that’s super exciting.”

McCormick clearly isn’t backing away from the expectations. More similar to Troy Fautanu DeCastro was the team’s first-round pick in 2012 going lower in the draft than projections and the last West Coast college prospect the team had taken in the first round prior to Fautanu. After battling injury as a rookie DeCastro turned into one of the NFL’s best guards a six-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro before ankle problems shortened his career. Faneca came before both of them a first round pick and Hall of Famer even if his call to Canton took longer than it should’ve.

A punishing run blocker with tons of experience McCormick didn’t get his phone call until early on Day 3 the team’s fourth round pick. While McCormick will keep his goals high expectations out of the gate are lower than they were for DeCastro. Pittsburgh’s starting guards of James Daniels and Isaac Seumalo are set in stone entering the spring meaning McCormick is set to begin the year as a backup.

But o-line depth is valuable and can be quickly tested. Pittsburgh has been incredibly fortunate to avoid serious or multiple offensive line injuries the past two seasons but sheer law of averages suggests that luck will run out. That could push McCormick into a role sooner than expected.

“I’m ready to do whatever it takes to get on the field” he said. “I’ll play either guard spot center whatever it takes. I just want to help this organization in any way I can.”

That could include reps at center. McCormick noted he was the backup center in college and had South Dakota State’s starter gotten hurt he would’ve shifted over. Pittsburgh worked him out as such shortly before the draft and though Zach Frazier’s selection makes him a clear favorite to start the Steelers like to make their backups as versatile as possible. Friday McCormick played right guard and the Steelers will likely have him work at guard this spring before considering center come training camp.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy1zaWduLWRyYWZ0LXBpY2tzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtdG8tcm9va2llLWNvbnRyYWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers sign draft picks Mason McCormick Logan Lee to rookie contracts,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://triblive.com/sports/steelers-sign-draft-picks-mason-mccormick-logan-lee-to-rookie-contracts/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy1zaWduLWRyYWZ0LXBpY2tzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtdG8tcm9va2llLWNvbnRyYWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen. Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9sb25kb24vc29tZWJvZHktd2lsbC1kaWUtaWYtZm9ybWVyLW1jY29ybWljay1zLWZhY3RvcnktaXNuLXQtdG9ybi1kb3duLW5laWdoYm91cnMtc2F5LTEuNzE5OTI4OdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS43MTk5Mjg5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Somebody will die' if former McCormick's factory isn't torn down neighbours say,"The owners of the former McCormick's candy factory on Dundas Street have been ordered by city bylaw officials to restore security fencing around the crumbling building but business owners near the property say much more needs to be done to deal with what they call a dangerous eyesore.

""The fence usually lasts 48 hours"" said Gord Inglis who operates Inglis Cycle located on McCormick Boulevard behind the property. ""It's very run down neglected not looked after and ignored and it's turned into a playground for children and an area where homeless people [go] in and out.""

A work order was posted on three parts of the fence surrounding some of the property stating that a property inspection done May 8 found contraventions of a city bylaw that requires owners to ensure that vacant buildings are secured against unauthorized entry and to protect the building from the risk of ""fire accident or other danger.""

When a CBC News reporter visited the site on Thursday there were at least eight places where the fence had been torn down partially or completely allowing anyone to walk onto the property.

Windows doors and duct openings were recently covered with plywood Inglis said but that's also usually torn down within days.

Redevelopment of the factory has stalled while the owner of the property appeals limits set by city council. (Kate Dubinski/CBC)

Two young teens had to be rescued from the roof of the building on Sunday night London Fire said. There was a fire in the building and the teens who were exploring inside made their way to the roof while they waited for help said Platoon Chief Kirk Loveland. An aerial ladder was used to communicate with the youth and tell them to stay put until firefighters came to the roof to escort them out of the building he said. The teens weren't hurt and were taken away by police.

A similar incident happened on Thursday afternoon. A teen was stuck in the building and police requested the aerial truck again so they could communicate with the young person and escort them out of the building.

Seeing young people in the building is a frequent occurrence Inglis said. ""I feel the city is playing with the devil. Every time an emergency service is called to the building it seems to be more severe. If you don't do something with this building somebody is going to get hurt.""

There are concerns over this former east London factory as redevelopment plans have stalled Duration 0:56 Once a bustling confectionary factory the former McCormick building is now an eyesore that is dangerous for people going in to strip out any metal that can be sold for cash and youth looking for an urban exploring thrill.

'We're picking up garbage everyday'

The recent rescue was just one of the latest incidents where emergency crews were called to the building said Lou Fatibene who owns neighbouring Dundas Automotive.

""I'm surprised nobody's been killed over there yet"" Fatibene said. ""We've had cars broken into the whole area has been vandalized. We're picking up garbage every day.""

Somebody's going to die"" he said. ""How much did it cost us taxpayers to have that aerial truck out there to save the kids?""

Tena Smith who works at Tim's Tires across the street from the old factory says young people are using it as an urban exploration site. Some throw bricks and other items from the roof damaging property and cars below.

""Every Monday when we come in after the weekend it's like the teenagers have had a heyday in there and they've knocked out more windows"" she said. ""We used to park our cars over there to make room for our customers but they throw stuff off the roof. A brick landed on my car and dented my roof so we don't park over there anymore.""

The fence that's supposed to keep people out of the crumbling factory is not very effective. (Kate Dubinski/CBC)

The owners of the property Sierra Construction based in Woodstock did not reply to emails and phone calls asking for comment. They have until May 12 to comply with the city's work order.

The company bought the property for $1. In 2021 McCormick Villages Inc. owned and run by Sierra Construction submitted a plan for a subdivision for the factory site comprising of five hectares. In October 2022 city council approved the development which included repurposing the former factory into a mixed-use mid-rise building as well as townhouses a long-term care facility and a seniors apartment building on the property.

But Sierra Construction wasn't happy with council's decision to limit the apartment building height to five-storeys and to make a multi-use path on the property publicly-accessible among other issues. The Ontario Land Tribunal will consider that appeal in June.

It's been frustrating watching the building and property fall further and further into disrepair said Ward 4 Coun. Susan Stevenson. ""It's becoming a huge safety concern and a lot of people are worried that there will be a tragedy there let alone the disturbance to the neighbourhood that's happening as well"" she said. ""The neighbours just want it taken down."""

Along with all the classic menu items that are never going anywhere—like the Big Mac McNuggets and Quarter Pounder—there were several new additions a few limited time offerings and several fan-favorite items that made a grand return.

However not everything that popped onto the McDonald's menu in 2022 was a permanent addition so don't get your hopes up too high for the items we're covering here today. In fact a few have already come and gone. In other cases it may be only a matter of time before we're discussing items that have been removed from the McDonald's menu.

Here are 13 items that were launched or brought back by McDonald's in 2022 and whether or not you can still get them.

McDonald's Report Reveals the #1 Most-Ordered Item in 2022—& It Isn't a Burger

Smoky BLT Quarter Pounder

Launched in the fall of 2022 and always planned to be a ""Limited Time Only"" offering this is a burger you should try while you can. It's basically a McD's Quarter Pounder with Cheese that's been dressed up a bit and said ""dressing"" includes applewood smoked bacon freshly-sliced tomatoes and a smoky sauce. And while reviews have been mixed especially on the price there are some that love the new iteration of the Quarter Pounder.

McRib

The McRib is the classic here again gone again McDonald's menu item. It is as famous for its inconsistent appearances on the menu as it is for its smoky flavor. But when McDonald's returned the McRib to the menu in 2022 they did so with a warning that once it's pulled again it's going to be gone for a long time or maybe the last time.

McPlant

While the McPlant—McDonald's first plant-based burger—did not debut in 2022 it did hit many new markets. After being available at only a handful of nationwide locations for several months the plant-based item was rolled out to 600 additional McDonald's restaurants in February. However the menu item didn't perform as projected and it was nixed off every menu in July.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Krispy Kreme Donuts

In October McDonald's tugged at our sweet heartstrings when it was announced that limited locations would start selling Krispy Kreme's famous donuts. While only nine locations in Kentucky and Indiana were participating in the test we can hope that they are a success and that more McDonald's will follow suit in 2023.

Holiday Pie

Brightly festooned with colorful sprinkles and loaded with creamy vanilla custard McD's Holiday Pie is back for the holiday season. It is a treat that comes out most years but not every year so get yours soon if you love them.

OREO Fudge McFlurry

Another fall release that has a planned end date (we don't know exactly when so don't wait too long) the OREO Fudge McFlurry is about as rich and sweet as frozen fast-food desserts get. The regular-sized version packs in 630 calories and 20 grams of fat FYI so consider a ""snack size"" or at least make this a once or twice treat. P.S. if you miss the run you can hack this item by just adding fudge to an Oreo McFlurry.

Chocolatey Pretzel McFlurry

In May McDonald's made customers with a sweet-and-salty tooth sing when it released a new McFlurry with vanilla soft serve caramel swirls and blended-in chocolate pretzel bites. It alas is gone for now.

Glazed Pull Apart Donut

In April this sharable donut wa sbrought back to the menu after a successful debut in 2021. Outside of its current appearance the Glazed Pull Apart Donut made its debut as part of a fall menu update in 2021. The pastry came as a follow-up to the Apple Fritter Blueberry Muffin and Cinnamon Roll—the first breakfast pastry additions the chain had made in a decade.

Shamrock Shake

Of course the beloved perennial green shake returned just in time for St. Patrick's Day with a McFlurry partner. It again left the menu shortly after as customer look forward to the holiday and it's return in 2023.

Pumpkin and Crème Pie

This is one that you have already missed if you didn't try it in the fall we're sorry to say. As chains across the nation rolled out pumpkin spice everything in September McDonald's added the Pumpkin and Crème Pie to the menu the sweet treat featuring a filling that blended pumpkin pie and sweet crème.

Bagel Sandwiches

Remember how McDonald's used to have bagels on the menu? The pandemic ended that nationwide. But in 2022 in select markets bagel sandwiches began returning to the McD's menu. At last check bagels are only back in Columbus Chicago Washington D.C. New York City and other New England areas.

Cheese Danish

McDonald's brought the Cheese Danish back to the menu in 2022 for the first time in years—decades in fact. It was last offered back in the 1980s. This 21st-century take on the treat—which is not available everywhere—is a flaky pastry filled with sweet cream cheese topped with sugary vanilla-flavored icing.

SACRAMENTO Calif. — A juvenile and an adult man allegedly carjacked a couple as they were leaving a Sacramento McDonald's Friday night.

According to the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office the suspects approached couple armed with handguns as they were walking out of the McDonald's on Stockton Boulevard and Florin Road just before midnight.

Armando Ramos and his family from Yuba City were shocked to hear of something like this happening in the area. They ate dinner nearby Saturday night.

“It feels like it’s not safe because of everything that happened but it can happen to anyone” he said.

After responding to the scene deputies say they found the carjacked car in a nearby liquor store parking lot and detained four people two of whom matched the suspect description.

Deputies say they found a second car in the same parking lot that had also been reported stolen. They also found keys to the carjacked car nearby after the juvenile suspect allegedly attempted to hide them.

Alphonzo ""Phonz"" Terrell and DeVaris Brown have created an alternative to Twitter called Spill.

The former Twitter employees are catering to ""culture drivers"" especially Black and queer creators.

Spill is expected to launch next month and already has 20000 people on its waitlist Terrell said.

Today two former Twitter employees announced the creation of a new social platform Spill designed as an alternative to the bird app catering to ""culture drivers"" and serving as a refuge for creators from Black Twitter.

Alphonzo ""Phonz"" Terrell and DeVaris Brown told TechCrunch that Spill is intended to be ""a real-time conversational platform that puts culture first"" when it launches in January.

Terrell served as Twitter's global head of social and editorial for three years — until last month when he was among the thousands of employees laid off following Elon Musk's takeover. Brown worked on machine learning as a product manager lead at Twitter for over a year but pivoted in 2020 to create the Series A startup Meroxa a real-time data service.

""While Spill is for everyone we are catering to culture drivers who frequently set new trends yet routinely get overlooked and under compensated"" Terrell tweeted in his announcement of the app. ""Yes we mean Black creators Queer creators and a variety of influential voices outside the U.S.""

The founders told TechCrunch they bonded over being Black employees while working at Twitter and wanted to create a space to highlight the cultural contributions and influential content creation Black users frequently brought to the app.

Called ""a cultural force to be reckoned with"" by The Guardian Black Twitter is at the heart of many viral digital culture moments as well as real-world social movements. Hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter #SayHerName as well as the Kermit the Frog drinking tea meme (among many others) either originated or were popularized by the unofficial online network.

""Even before I left Twitter over the last several months I was just talking to Black female creators talking to Black queer creators and I'm like 'How do you make your money? Is any platform supporting you? Does the idea of Spill interest you?'"" Terrell told TechCrunch.

The Spill app named for the phrase ""spill the tea"" will use blockchain to compensate users for popular posts and will include a feature called ""tea parties"" where users can gather online or in real life to connect.

""It's not a web3 thing"" Terrell told TechCrunch. ""But the use of blockchain is for both crediting creators and setting up a model for us to compensate them automatically. If they have a spill that goes viral and we monetize it it's really effective.""

Since Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in October hate speech and slurs against Black users have skyrocketed and popular users from Black Twitter have used comedy to mourn the loss of their online community.

""We're going to be more intentional and be more accurate around things that will be deemed offensive because again this is our lived experience or learned experience"" Brown told TechCrunch. ""It'll be much more accurate to catch those kinds of things that will detract from the platform that would not lend to creating a safe space for our users and our creators.""

Following the announcement of the app Terrell tweeted that Spill had received 20000 reservations for handles within 12 hours.







""Thank you for love the feedback the skepticism and the numerous offers of support – you have no idea how much this means"" Terrell tweeted.

The company operationally based in Fridley has been hit with 11 Class I recalls in 2022 and 12 in 2021 — far more than usual. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration reserves its Class I status for the most serious life-threatening medical device problems.

For comparison between 2017 and 2020 Medtronic averaged about five Class I recalls a year.

Seven of the company's 23 recalls in the last two years are related to the HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device (HVAD) that Medtronic acquired in 2016. Four of those recalls were in 2021; three were this year.

""Acquired products (such as HVAD) have been the biggest contributor to Class I … growth"" said Erika Winkels a spokeswoman for Medtronic. ""Improvements have been made to our process for assessing and integrating acquired products to reduce the contribution of acquired products to product quality issues moving forward.""

As of June 2021 when Medtronic stopped selling the beleaguered product the company said 14 deaths had been linked to defects with the HVAD device. So far Medtronic's 2022 recalls are linked to a small number of deaths.

The uptick in recalls at the world's largest medical device maker is troubling to many.

""Clearly there's a problem when a company has this many recalls — Class I recalls on important potentially life-saving devices"" said Diana Zuckerman president of Washington D.C.-based National Center for Health Research a nonprofit think tank that works to improve the safety and effectiveness of medical products.

Medtronic bet big on HVAD technology when it acquired Massachusetts-based HeartWare International Inc. for $1.1 billion in 2016. But it has cost Medtronic just as much to unspool the product's string of legal and regulatory problems. According to details in a financial filing earlier this year Medtronic has taken $1.1 billion in charges connected to exiting the HVAD business.

Acquiring technology from other companies Zuckerman said does not absolve Medtronic of its device safety responsibilities. She said one issue stems from the way the FDA regulates medical devices many of which — unlike pharmaceuticals — are not required to submit any clinical trial data prior to approval.

""That is a known weakness of the FDA but it does put the onus on the company"" she said. ""Regardless of what FDA requires them to do companies should be really careful making sure their product is safe.""

When the pandemic hit the FDA stopped most foreign and domestic inspections except for cases considered mission critical.

Class I medical device recalls are increasing across the industry said Rachna Shah of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota who studies medical device and pharmaceutical recalls.

""In general recalls are higher"" Shah said. She said one possible explanation for more serious recalls is that device companies may have become less rigorous in safety reviews for their products as the FDA was doing less monitoring.

She expects marginally higher recalls to continue through the end of next year.

But Medtronic's rate of recalls has significantly outpaced its competitors. Illinois-based Abbott has seen only one recall this year. Massachusetts-based Boston Scientific Corp. has had no recalls in 2022. Illinois-based Baxter International has had five recalls. All three of those companies have operations in Minnesota.

Medtronic with fiscal 2022 sales of $31.7 billion is the largest medical device manufacturer in the industry which puts it at higher recall risk because it simply makes more products than anyone else.

Abbott has diverse business lines; its medical device sales for 2021 were $14.4 billion. Boston Scientific posted revenue of $11.9 billion. Not counting its pharmaceutical division Baxter had $10.5 billion in medical device sales last year. Medtronic's revenue is equivalent to 86% of the combined sales of those three companies.

""The number of Class 1 recalls in recent years is atypical for us"" Medtronic's Winkels said.

Medtronic has established a central medical safety organization and added a patient safety and risk board. The board includes senior leaders from several departments — medical safety quality regulatory and legal — and provides oversight for patient safety decisions. Both were implemented in 2022.

""We have examined our end-to-end quality performance and we are focused on making sustainable improvements"" said Noel Colon Medtronic's chief quality officer. He said the company has increased oversight in such areas as risk assessment product design and integration of acquired therapies and solutions.

Medical device recalls often begin with the company which sends out alerts to doctors and patients when a problem is discovered. The FDA doesn't typically classify the severity of the recall — Class I II or III — until a few months later meaning that a recall listed on the FDA's index for 2022 may have first been launched by the company in 2021.

Unlike food and consumer product recalls a medical device recall does not necessarily mean that the product is removed from a patient and returned to the company. Recalls can often involve adjustments to device settings software updates or re-labeling a product.

In the case of any recall Medtronic undertakes a detailed investigation to resolve the issue and prevent its recurrence Winkels said.

This year's high number of recalls prompted Medtronic to implement new plans and programs that include a more rigorous review of a device's risk assessment.

Winkels said the company has ""leveraged external experts for independent perspective subject matter expertise and to supplement internal Medtronic resources.""

In September the FDA identified the company's recall of NIM endotracheal tubes as a Class I case. Medtronic reported 15 complaints two deaths and three injuries related to the device between March 31 2020 and March 31 2022.

The FDA issued a Class I recall of Cobalt Cobalt XT and Crome defibrillators in August due to the potential for delivering lower-than-necessary shocks to the patient. That issue was addressed with a software update. Medtronic reported 27 complaints and zero deaths or injuries.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Inc. (MRK): Here is What You Need to Know,"Merck (MRK) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +2.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry to which Merck belongs has gained 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

Merck is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the current quarter representing a year-over-year change of +202.9%. Over the last 30 days the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.3%.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $8.66 points to a change of +473.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.3%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $9.91 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.7%.

With an impressive externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For Merck the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.8%. For the current and next fiscal years $64.28 billion and $68.81 billion estimates indicate +6.9% and +7.1% changes respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Merck reported revenues of $15.78 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +8.9%. EPS of $2.07 for the same period compares with $1.40 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.32 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.95%. The EPS surprise was +6.7%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples such as price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on) is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

Merck is graded C on this front indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBoYXJtYWxldHRlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zZXRiYWNrLWZvci1tZXJjay1pbi1iYXR0bGUtdG8tdHJlYXQtZW5kb21ldHJpYWwtY2FuY2Vy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Setback for Merck & Co in battle to treat endometrial cancer,"Merck & Co (NYSE: MRK) has announced that the Phase III KEYNOTE-B21 trial of its leading checkpoint blocker Keytruda (pembrolizumab) has failed.

This is the side view of the massive Meta Grand Teton system with 8x NVIDIA H100 GPUs in a pull-out tray:

One can see a few common features. For example Meta is using many OCP NIC 3.0 form factor network cards. There are at least ten that we could on the front of the chassis. In this generation with PCIe Gen5 they can be 200GbE or 400GbE/ 400Gbps IB ports. The company also has an EDSFF (E1) storage array on the front of the chassis and another section for E1.S boot drives. If you want to learn more about EDSFF you can see E1 and E3 EDSFF to Take Over from M.2 and 2.5 in SSDs. This is a great example of the M.2 boot devices being phased out in favor of E1.S.

Meta says that the new system offers significantly more bandwidth and also simplifies deployment with a single box versus having a CPU head node a switching box and then the accelerators.

At the same time power is up 2x over the previous generation which is quite impressive. That is a bigger jump than the NVIDIA A100 to NVIDIA H100 jump with the H100’s public specs at 700W. CPU TDP is going up in this generation as is NIC TDP.

Final Words

Meta uses AI all over and is a leader in the space so seeking more performance makes a lot of sense here. This is an especially interesting announcement since Meta RSC Selected NVIDIA and Pure Storage for its AI Research Cluster in the NVIDIA A100 generation. Now Meta has its own training platform. This does not seem like the company’s craziest platform but it is nice to see some innovation happening in the space. For companies that are not Meta this platform looks very similar to many of the Supermicro QCT and other platforms that we have seen for 8x NVIDIA H100 configurations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0aW1lcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjg1MTAwLzIwMjIxMjE4L2Zha2UtZmFjZWJvb2stcHJvZmlsZS1waWN0dXJlcy1nZW5lcmF0ZWQtYWktbm93LXJpc2Utc3BvdC5odG3SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNodGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlcy8yODUxMDAvMjAyMjEyMTgvZmFrZS1mYWNlYm9vay1wcm9maWxlLXBpY3R1cmVzLWdlbmVyYXRlZC1haS1ub3ctcmlzZS1zcG90Lmh0bQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fake Facebook Profile Pictures Generated by AI Now on the Rise!

This is a big deal for Meta Platforms Inc. since scammers and other malicious actors can now have more legit-looking FB profile photos.

Because of this Meta urges users to avoid accepting friend requests from unknown accounts even if their profile images look legitimate.

Fake Facebook Profile Pictures Generated by AI Are Speading

According to News9's latest report Meta already reported rising AI-generated fake FB profiles to Congress.

Photo taken on October 18 2021 in Moscow shows the US online social media and social networking service Facebook's logo on a tablet screen. - Facebook on October 18 2021 announced plans to hire 10000 people in the European Union to build the ""metaverse"" a virtual reality version of the internet that the tech giant sees as the future.

Ben Nimmo Meta's Global Threat Intelligence lead said that these Facebook profile images are photos of individuals who don't exist.

""It's not actually a person in the picture. It's an image created by a computer"" said the Meta official via CBS News.

Nimmo added that over two-thirds of the accounts that were disrupted in 2022 used profile pictures generated using GANs (generative adversarial networks).

For those unfamiliar with GANs these publicly-available AI-powered software models are specifically designed to create deep fakes.

This is why most GAN-generated images look so real even though those individuals are not real.

How Facebook Identify Fake Profile Pics

Meta explained that they are looking at a combination of behavioral signals to detect the AI-generated fake profile images.

Although these photos created by GANs look legitimate there are some signs that show they are not from real humans such as the following:

The background looks more artificial.

People's eyes on the fake images are perfectly aligned.

There are no reflections on the eyes.

We also reported that Meta wants to bring Facebook and Instagram changes to teenagers' privacy online.

More Layoffs At Meta? Facebook Parent Company To Shut Down Its ‘Super’ Live-Streaming Platform In 2023

In a statement Meta said the time has come to bid goodbye to Super a live-streaming platform for influencers developed by the company in 2020.

Meta said it had hoped to create a virtual meet-and-greet experience that was similar to what users experience at a real-life event like VidCon or Comic-Con reports TechCrunch.

New Delhi: Are more layoffs expected at Meta? This comes as Meta said it is shutting down its cameo-like app Super on February 15 in 2023. In a statement Meta said the time has come to bid goodbye to Super a live-streaming platform for influencers developed by the company in 2020. This means employees or teams who worked for the app Super may lose their jobs. However Meta has not yet confirmed any reports on more layoffs and an official announcement is expected. Super will not be officially shut down until February. However users won’t be unable to create new events during this time.

“What we found we’d created however was a much greater opportunity for creators and fans to connect in fun and exciting ways. We saw creators and fans raise funds for good causes launch a new set of books test drive new jokes for standup routines and even play trivia against one another. It was amazing to see the joy and creativity in each new Super event. Sadly however the time has come for us to say goodbye” the company said news agency IANS was quoted as saying in the report.

Meta said it had hoped to create a virtual meet-and-greet experience that was similar to what users experience at a real-life event like VidCon or Comic-Con reports TechCrunch.

Super joins a long list of experiments and apps that have been shut down by Meta earlier. Earlier this week Meta reportedly shut down its Connectivity division almost 10 years after launching the initiative.

In October the company announced to shut down its newsletter product called Bulletin for creators and writers by early 2023 while in August it shut down Quest 1 virtual reality (VR) headset support for ‘Population: One’ its popular battle-royale game set in VR.

The Jets playoff hopes might have gone up in smoke in their first home game in three weeks.

Lions (7-7) defeated the Jets (7-7) 20-17 on a sunny 40-degree day at MetLife Stadium. The loss hurts the Jets playoff hopes as they’ve lost three straight and five of their last seven after beginning the season 5-2. Coming into Sunday the Jets were ninth in the AFC regarding seeding.

With one second on the clock kicker Greg Zuerlein had an opportunity to send the game into overtime with a 58-yard field goal but the kick was wide left.

“I should have made the kick” Zuerlein said. “No matter the distance I didn’t hit it well. And that’s life.”

Sunday marked the return of quarterback Zach Wilson who started in his first game in a month after he was benched for Mike White following the Jets’ loss to the Patriots on Nov. 20. Doctors didn’t clear White after injuring his ribs in the 20-12 loss to the Bills last weekend.

Wilson had his best first half of the season against the Lions. He completed 8-of-14 passes for 185 yards and a touchdown. However in the second half Wilson threw his first interception of the game which turned into three points for the Lions.

The Jets benched Wilson because they wanted him to give him a “reset” so he could work on his mechanics with the hopes of him starting again this season.

Zach Wilson came up short in his return from being benched.

However for most of the second half Wilson looked like the quarterback who completed 9-of-22 passes for 78 yards in the 10-3 loss against the Patriots a month ago. Wilson finished the game 18-of-35 for 317 yards two touchdowns and an interception as he was erratic in the second half.

“It’s the ups and downs of football” Wilson said. “In that moment of going out there and throwing a bad interception I put our defense in a bad situation there.

“You see how those three points came back to bite us in the end. I gotta take care of the football. With the mindset after that I gotta move on it is what it is it happened and how can I rebound from this?

“You gotta be able to move on in this league and I felt like the guys around me did an amazing job. They kept fighting and kept going.”

The Jets were also without defensive tackle Quinnen Williams who has 11 sacks on the season due to a calf injury sustained in the Week 14 loss against the Bills. In his absence the Jets defense didn’t allow a touchdown in the first half. They also held a top-five offense to 308 total yards until Detroit’s final offensive play of the game.

However a busted coverage on fourth down with less than two minutes left in the game allowed the Lions to take a three-point lead and the win.

“Credit to their OC [offensive coordinator] their head coach whoever calls their plays” Jets cornerback D.J. Reed said. “They gave their ball to the tight end who normally doesn’t get the ball in those situations.

“We are playing an aggressive defense because it is 4th and 1 and you have to play aggressive. If we stop the run we win the game.

“As a defense we put that on us because we want to be in those situations. We have a top defense in the NFL so we put that on us we put that on our chest and we take it on the chin.”

Detroit drove the ball right down the field to the one-yard line on the game’s first drive. But the Jets and linebacker Quincy Williams provided a goal-line stand on fourth down which kept the Lions out of the end zone.

Following a three-and-out by the Jets’ offense the Lions got the ball right back and scored a touchdown on former Jet Kalif Raymond’s 47-yard punt return which made the score 7-0.

Gang Green got on the board at the beginning of the second quarter. First Wilson completed a 33-yard pass to Garrett Wilson which put the team at the Lions’ 40-yard line. Immediately following that Wilson threw a 40-yard touchdown pass to C.J. Uzomah that tied the game and brought a roar to the crowd at MetLife Stadium.

A little past the midway point of the second quarter the Lions retook the lead 10-7 after Michael Badgley’s 31-yard field goal.

The Jets tied the game up 10-10 at halftime after a 50-yard pass to Jeff Smith which put the Jets in Lions’ territory. Zuerlein then converted a 34-yard field goal.

Gang Green got the ball after halftime but Wilson threw an interception to Jerry Jacobs as he returned it to the Jets’ 15-yard line. Detroit got three points off the turnover as Badgley’s 34-yarder gave the team a 13-10 lead early in the third quarter.

Neither team did much offensively in the third quarter as Wilson struggled with accuracy to the displeasure of Jets fans who booed the team’s offense multiple times.

But finally the Jets got their offense in gear after Badgley’s 54-yard field goal was no good. Wilson completed a 33-yard pass to Wilson which put the Jets on the 21-yard line. Five plays later Wilson completed a one-yard touchdown to Uzomah giving the Jets a 17-13 lead with 4:41 left in the fourth quarter.

At the two-minute warning the Jets defense had a chance to end the game on 4th and 1 as the Lions had the ball on their 49-yard line. But Jared Goff completed a 51-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brock Wright giving Detroit a 20-17 lead with 1:49 left.

Wilson and the Jets had one last opportunity to tie or take the lead before the end of regulation. But Zuerlein’s 58-yard field goal was no good.

The Jets will return to the field four days from now as they will host the Jaguars in their final home game of the season. The Lions will be on the road next weekend as they will play the Panthers at Bank of America Stadium.

“Everyone knows we gotta win out” Jets coach Robert Saleh said. “We got a quick turnaround. We got a Thursday night game we got Jacksonville coming to town and they’re another high-octane offense so they’re feeling good about themselves.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGl2ZS5jb20vdGh1cnNkYXktY2hhbnVrYWgtZmVzdGl2aXRpZXMtYW5kLW1pdnR6b2ltLWF0LW1ldGxpZmUtc3RhZGl1bS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thursday: Chanukah Festivities and Mivtzoim at Metlife Stadium,"On Thursday night of Chanukah the Crown Heights community is invited to bring the light of Chanukah to thousands of Jewish fans at the NY Jets football game at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey joining a large Menorah lighting and festivities. Full Story

While we may know it as the fifth night of Chanukah this year many of our Jewish brothers and sisters will know it only as Thursday Night Football… Unless we do something about it.

On Thursday December 22 ohr L’Chof Tes Kislev at 8:15 pm the NY Jets will play against the Jacksonville Jaguars at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Chabad of the Meadowlands would like to invite the extended Crown Heights community to come tailgate at the stadium. Thousands of Jewish football fans will be there and it is our responsibility and privilege to ensure they are all given an opportunity to celebrate Chanukah.

Beginning five hours before the game as fans begin to fill the parking lot we will be there to offer tefillin Chanukah menorahs and a good word. Closer to gametime we will prominently host a menorah lighting right in front of the stadium main entrance just as hordes of attendees’ head into the stadium.

All throughout there will be a Menorah Mivtzoim booth and barbeque set up on the concourse walkway between lots F and G.

Tailgating and Mivtzoim begins at 3:00 PM.

Menorah lighting in front of MetLife gate at 7:00 PM.

Kickoff at 8:15 PM

Again all are invited!

Come for the Mivtzoim. Come for the Menorah Lighting. Come for the Tailgate. Come for Hakhel!

Mivtzoim at MetLife is a project of Chabad of the Meadowlands.

Each Sunday during the tailgating prior to the game Mivtzoim at MetLife provides Jewish football fans an opportunity to connect with their creator. So far this year hundreds of fans have put on tefillin many for the first time. Several hundred Jewish fans shook lulav and esrog at just one game on Sukkos. Connections are being made with many regulars who are otherwise completely unaffiliated.

Please reach out to Rabbi Ephraim Balter (770) 203-1305 regarding sponsorship opportunities or any other inquiries.

HOUSTON — NFL you have ""The Problem!"" Rookie linebacker James Houston IV notched his fifth sack of the season against the New York Jets in the Lions' 20-17 victory at MetLife Stadium.

Each year in the NFL there will be at least one player to prove NFL scouts wrong with a breakout season. This year's candidate is HBCU Legend James Houston IV. Detroit's 6th-round pick was cut signed to the practice squad patiently waited got the call and has the Lions fans calling for him as ""The Problem!""

""We're seeing James Houston from Jackson State go out there and make many plays with the Detroit Lions."" Deion Sanders

After four games since being elevated off the practice squad for their annual Thanksgiving Day game the former Jackson State star has set an NFL record or two or three!

Let's take a look at James ""The Problem"" Houston IV sacks:

Houston has recorded five sacks in four-straight games and becomes the first NFL player since 2000 to start their career with this streak. The Problem is the 3rd player in NFL history to produce a sack in their first four games. Who were the other two players? Terrell Suggs in 2003 and Santana Dotson in 1992. He is the 14th NFL player to register a sack in their first three NFL games and the first Detroit player ever. Houston is the first Detroit Lions rookie to record four-straight games with a sack and tied the franchise's record for a defender doing the same. Comparison: The club's first-round pick Aidan Hutchinson has seven sacks on the season in 14 game appearances compared to five sacks for Houston in four game appearances. The only Detroit rookie to have at least one sack in four-straight games. The other players with three straight games are Cliff Avril (2008) and Tracy Scroggins (1992). Houston (5 sacks) and Hutchinson (7 sacks) are the NFL's best rookie combo for sacks this season at 12.

Houston is maturing into becoming an edge rusher for the Lions and making the most of his opportunity. He's doing what many NFL teams need — someone to effect harass and get to the quarterback.

The next phase in his maturation process is to become an ""every-down"" defender.

It will be up to Houston and the Detroit staff to cultivate the potential of what HBCU teams knew about him in 2021. He's ""The Problem"" that very well could be ""The Answer"" to keep the Lions' streak going into the postseason."

MGM,MGM Resorts,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzE3L2JldHRlci1idXktbWdtLXJlc29ydHMtb3ItY2Flc2Fycy1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: MGM Resorts or Caesars Entertainment?,"Casinos and sports betting services both physical and online look poised for growth in the coming years.

While online sports betting has rapidly gained popularity in recent years the brick-and-mortar casino industry was severely impacted by COVID-19 restrictions -- and now it's being hindered by the combination of high inflation and a slowing economy.

That said according to research firm Statista the $231 billion global casino and online gambling industry will continue growing through 2024 and likely beyond. Properly positioned casino companies stand to benefit from this growth as do their investors.

Let's take a look at two major players in this space MGM Resorts International (MGM -0.69%) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR -3.00%) and weigh the question of which of these casino stocks is a better buy now.

The case for MGM Resorts International

With MGM Resorts stock down by more than 28% from its November 2021 high investors might be asking themselves if it's time to buy the dip. While the company's $3.4 billion in Q3 revenue was a quarterly record it was still unable to eke out a profit.

Room occupancy was a prime driver of that record revenue reaching 93% during the third quarter. That's the highest this metric has been since COVID-19 hit. The top-line result also came in 26% higher than the same period in 2021 and that's despite a 70% decline in revenue from MGM China due to that country's zero-COVID restrictions.

After strong back-to-back quarters CEO Bill Hornbuckle cited the attractiveness of MGM's properties both as vacation spots and as meeting places for business travelers. Convention business not only creates a considerable revenue stream for the casino operator but also helps to gauge future occupancy levels due to its far-in-advance lead times.

BetMGM the company's partner for both online and in-person sports betting also continues to make significant progress. After adding Kansas to the list of states where it was available in Q3 MGM next plans to debut it in Massachusetts Ohio and Maryland. MGM controls a 29% share of the online casino gambling market making it the leading U.S. player in this fast-growing space.

The case for Caesars Entertainment

Caesars Entertainment stock has fallen even more dramatically during the past year and now trades more than 58% below its October 2021 peak. However Caesars also posted record third-quarter results and management recently described October 2022 as the ""strongest month ever"" for its Las Vegas business.

In Q3 the casino company observed its first taste of ""normal seasonality"" since the pandemic and booked more than $1 billion in adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Occupancy in Caesars' Las Vegas segment reached 94% during the quarter and the company broke quarterly records for hotel revenue hotel profit and gaming revenue.

But while revenue soared so did utility expenses. The company normally operates at a 48% to 49% profit margin but in Q3 its profit margin only reached around 35%. A combination of high utility expenses and construction interruptions contributed to that drop in profitability.

Caesars Digital the company's digital sportsbook and online casino enjoyed a remarkable 121% revenue increase in the third quarter. While it was still unprofitable for the quarter its net loss was much smaller than last year's and reflected strong year-over-year improvement for the digital segment.

As for Q4 Caesars CEO Tom Reeg called October ""the strongest month in the history of Las Vegas for Caesars.""

How do the two companies differ?

On the surface both MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment share similar business models. Both operate a robust portfolio of casinos and resorts worldwide and both offer a digital gambling and sportsbook option. However there are subtle differences between the two. Caesars for example is known for plentiful luxury shopping options on its properties. MGM meanwhile has a better hold on the flourishing online sportsbook market.

The self-titled ""King of Sportsbooks"" MGM has emerged as a leader in this space. Considering rapid adoption and popularity of online sports betting MGM Resorts International should have a bright future taking this industry forward. Currently a more passive participant in the online sports betting revolution Caesars might not benefit as substantially.

Which stock is a better buy right now?

Based purely on revenue a stock's price-to-sales ratio can indicate whether a company is undervalued or overpriced -- the lower the ratio the better.

Metric MGM Resorts International Caesars Entertainment Market capitalization $14.0 billion $10.6 billion Price-to-sales ratio 1.11 1.00

Although Caesars Entertainment has a slightly lower price-to-sales ratio I think MGM stock makes the better buy at this point due to its leadership role in the online sportsbook game ever-present marketing efforts and significantly larger market capitalization.

However both of these casino stocks look to be gaining steam as the world wakes up from its COVID slump. Considering Caesars stock is down nearly 60% from its 2021 highs it could also represent an extremely opportunistic buying opportunity for long-term investors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxhc3ZlZ2FzYWR2aXNvci5jb20vcXVlc3Rpb24vdmljaS1wcm9wZXJ0aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Much of the Strip Does VICI Properties Own?,"I read in News that Vici Properties now owns Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand in full. Does Vici own everything now? Can you please give us a rundown of what Vici owns and who pays rent and how much?

A:

On the east side of the Strip Vici owns Venetian/Palazzo Harrah's and MGM Grand; on the west Mirage Caesars Palace Park MGM Excalibur Luxor New York-New York and Mandalay Bay.

Vici is the landlord for all these properties while MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment own the operations.

Vici also owns 30-odd other casino properties around the U.S. including Harrah's Laughlin and Lake Tahoe; Harvey's Lake Tahoe; Harrah's in Council Bluffs North Kansas City New Orleans Gulf Coast Metropolis Joliet Atlantic City and Philadelphia; and several Horseshoes MGMs Caesars and others. More than half of the rent that Vici collects comes from outside of Las Vegas.

As you mention Vici owned only half of MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay but it bought the other half from Blackstone recently. Blackstone still owns Bellagio and the Cosmopolitan whose operations are owned by MGM Resorts.

As to how much rent Vici collects with the MBay/MGM acquisition it's nearing $3 billion per year. Breaking down exactly who pays exactly what for each property is beyond what we can do but here are some examples.

MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay will pay $310 million. Venetian/Palazzo pays $250 million a year. The Mirage which will be owned by Hard Rock starting tomorrow now that the Gaming Commission approved the sale (on Friday) will pay $90 million.

Vici is a publicly traded company. You can buy its stock and own a piece of all these casino renters. The stock as of this writing is trading around $34.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbS52ZWdhc2luYy5sYXN2ZWdhc3N1bi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvdG91cmlzbS8yMDIyL2RlYy8xNy9uby1yZXF1ZXN0LWlzLXRvby1iaWctb3ItdG9vLXNtYWxsLWZvci10aGUtaGVyb2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No request is too big or too small for the heroes of the hospitality industry - Saturday Dec. 17 2022 | 2 a.m.,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbS52ZWdhc2luYy5sYXN2ZWdhc3N1bi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvdG91cmlzbS8yMDIyL2RlYy8xNy9uby1yZXF1ZXN0LWlzLXRvby1iaWctb3ItdG9vLXNtYWxsLWZvci10aGUtaGVyb2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D8278F820>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

With mandatory quarantines easing ferry and airline service resuming and licenses renewed casinos hope 2023 marks a new beginning for the world's preeminent gambling destination Macao.

The Macao government awarded six companies new 10-year concessions to operate their integrated casino resorts. A concession essentially is an operating agreement with the government which in turn licenses the operators.

To win the permission the casino companies agreed to invest collectively nearly $15 billion dollars in Macao to achieve government goals of diversifying the local economy beyond gambling and encouraging international tourism.

CNBC has also learned MGM will benefit from the allotment of 200 more gaming tables though the award comes at the expense of competitors including Wynn's properties according to multiple sources.

""We are confident that our position allocations are more than sufficient to allow us to thrive"" in Macao Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver said. The company serves high-quality players who generate meaningful revenue and profit premiums compared to competing casinos he added.

Las Vegas Sands and Hong Kong-based Galaxy Entertainmen t have the largest real estate footprints in Macao and have committed to the biggest investments.

Sands' agreement for a $3.75 billion dollar investment or 30 billion MOP will be roughly split between capital expenditures and operating expenses. Most of the investment will go toward non-gaming projects like a new conference facility and a luxury yacht experience that appeal to foreign visitors according to a company statement.

An executive in the company who asked not to be named characterized the financial commitment as a win as it entails investments that likely would have been made anyway — as opposed to an operating fee forked over in exchange for a license.

The sentiment is similar at MGM Resorts  which plans to invest its $2.1 billion commitment in three main areas: culture entertainment and medical tourism.

This month Macao has seen an increase in tourism from mainland China from visitors trying to get an mRNA Covid vaccine. The BioNTech shots have not been approved in mainland China but in Macao a Special Administrative Region or SAR the Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST) Hospital offers vaccinations for tourists.

Wynn Resorts ' commitment to a $2.2 billion investment over the next decade will incorporate plans for state-of-the-art theater and restaurant experiences. It also plans to expand its sales presence around Asia and North America to boost international tourism.

Melco Resorts and Entertainment announced the return of its House of Dancing Water extravaganza which has been suspended since the beginning of the pandemic. It will also build an indoor water park. The company also plans to focus on medical tourism by building a clinic with MRI and other advanced imaging technology.

Galaxy will build Macao's first high-tech amusement park. SJM Holdings will renovate its defunct floating casino to offer non-gaming entertainment options.

As the government works to usher in a new era the days of junkets bringing in high rollers to the island is all but finished. Crackdowns had curtailed that segment of the gaming business even before the pandemic began. This week the Macao secretary of finance and the gaming enforcement agency DICJ announced they will increase monitoring and enforcement around even stricter limits.

A rise in Covid infections around China caused November gaming revenue in Macao to fall 23% from October and plummet 99% from November 2019 pre-pandemic levels according to government data.

Even with the resumption of the e-visa program where Chinese travelers can apply electronically for travel documents and the easing of quarantine requirements the Macao government said it anticipates gross gaming revenue or GGR in 2023 to mirror 2022's GGR of roughly $16 billion as Macao struggles with continuing Covid overhang.

But Macao's loss may be Singapore's gain. Sands reported third-quarter results that showed a stunning jump in visitation and spending after Singapore lifted Covid travel restrictions.

Fitch estimates Singapore will achieve 80% of its pre-pandemic gaming revenue in 2022 and 95% in 2023.

High technology is national security issue,"The US was a major semiconductor producer in the 1990s making 37 percent of the world’s chips but today its share is only about 12 percent. TSMC’s move to more than triple its investment in the US will go a long way to satisfy US domestic demand in both the civilian and military sectors while building a strong supply chain which is less dependent on unreliable foreign partners.

The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced last week that it was upping its investment in Arizona from US$12 billion to US$40 billion and building a second chip plant in the state. Biden was in Phoenix to relish the moment. “ American manufacturing is back folks ” he exulted.

As the US-China competition gets sharper President Joe Biden’s decision to impose sweeping controls on the sale of semiconductors to China has brought the first taste of success—the world’s largest microchip manufacturer is raising its investment to US$40 billion in the United States (US).

Semiconductors are critical in an array of products ranging from cars medical equipment and consumer electronics to weapon systems. Expensive to make they are some of the most intricate pieces of technology requiring pristine conditions.

Chip shortages in the US sparked by supply-chain disruptions caused by the pandemic highlighted a dependence on foreign chip makers that US officials saw as a major national security issue. The White House’s brain trust of China experts grew even more determined to institute policies to reduce that dependence.

The new TSMC fabrication plant is expected to start the production of 4-nanometer chips by 2024 and 3-nanometer chips by 2026. Apple CEO Tim Cook—often accused of using cheap Chinese labour to make his high-end products—was with Biden to show support for the larger policy shift underway.

Biden framed his comments in the context of “allies and partners” who are “building alongside us as well”. The US is determinedly decoupling from China and at the same time attempting to contain it. Things came out of the closet the moment Washington announced its broad new measures against China in October.

The time between the announcement and TSMC’s enthusiastic response was barely two months. Under the Commerce Department’s new rules China can’t ‘buy American’ in a manner of speaking. Top-end semiconductors the machines to build them and the US talent to use them were all put out of China’s reach.

Aimed at strangling China’s high-tech industry the new controls also made clear that access and denial of high technology would be the defining element of geopolitics for the foreseeable future. And there is no dispute between Democrats and Republicans on hobbling China’s rise even if they agree on little else these days.

One might say it took a while for Washington to understand that its technological edge was slipping away as China made substantial progress in artificial intelligence chip manufacturing and quantum computing by investing in R&D luring talent from abroad and by forcing US corporations to share technology as a price of operating in China.

But like all good things it is coming to an end with the American political class waking up to the harsh reality. Whether other key global players join the US remains a question but for now Washington has made its intentions clear—foundational technologies are a matter of national security.

Also read: US tech curbs are making China pull its talent back home push for self-reliance

Putting muscle into the idea Biden’s signed the landmark CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 into law in August which mandates spending US$52.7 billion over the next five years in grants loans tax credits for capital expenditure and other incentives to encourage semiconductor manufacturing.

Between the Commerce Department’s stringent restrictions and the CHIPS Act the Biden administration wants to freeze China’s capabilities in place—14-nanometer chips which Beijing currently is capable of producing—by forbidding the export of equipment capable of making anything smaller.

As National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stated clearly in a speech in September the US was reassessing its old philosophy of staying only a couple of generations ahead. “This is not the strategic environment we are in today. Given the foundational nature of certain technologies such as advanced logic and memory chips we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.”

The lead will materialise in the shape of 3-nanometer chips as TSMC rolls them out at its new Arizona plant. For those watching the US-China tech war play out it’s clear who is in the lead in near and medium term.

Even a couple of weeks after its release there’s still just one configuration of the IdeaPad Duet 5i a $790 model with a Core i3-1215U 8GB of RAM a 128GB SSD and the included keyboard folio. The Active Pen is a $30 extra. That’s an inexpensive machine but it’s also limited in storage space with no option to increase it.

The Surface Pro 9 starts at $1000 for a Core i5-1235U 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD. The Signature Type Cover and Surface Slim Pen 2 add $280 to the price. You can spend as much as $2600 on a Core i7-1255U 32GB of RAM  and a 1TB SSD. The 5G model running a Microsoft SQ 3 ARM CPU ranges from $1300 to $1900.

Design

The IdeaPad Duet 5i and Surface Pro 9 are similar slates in many ways. They both sport rounded edges have similar display bezels and are constructed of aluminum. The IdeaPad comes in two colors Storm Gray and Stone Blue while the Surface Pro 9 comes in Platinum Slate Sapphire and Forest (with the 5G version coming only in Slate). They’re both 0.37 inches thick and the IdeaPad is slightly lighter. Even with its slightly smaller display the IdeaPad Duet 5i is as wide as Microsoft’s tablet and about a half-inch shallower.

Both tablets have a kickstand that extends out from the center of the tablet back and it works well on both and holds the tablets at a wide range of angles. They’re both smooth in operation and rigid to go with solidly built chassis that resist bending and flexing. From an overall design perspective neither tablet has a huge advantage.

The IdeaPad Duet 5i comes with a folio keyboard with snappy switches and plenty of key spacing making for comfortable typing. Its touchpad is large enough and responsive. The Microsoft Type Cover keyboard is also well-made with snappy precise switches and a good touchpad. Its advantage though is that it props up at an angle. That reduces stress on the wrists and makes for a more ergonomic typing experience.

The Surface Pro 9 does come with an extra port the Surface Connect port which allows charging without using one of the precious USB-C (with Thunderbolt 4 on the Surface Pro 9 Intel version) ports. Neither have SD card readers and both have Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.1. The ARM-based Surface Pro 9 supports 4G/5G WWAN for always-connected internet.

The IdeaPad Duet 5i has 5MP front and rear cameras while the Surface Pro 9 has a 1080p front camera and 10MB rear camera. Both have infrared cameras for Windows 11 Hello passwordless support.

Performance

The Core i3-1215U CPU in the IdeaPad Duet 5i is the only currently available option and it’s a 15-watt 12th-gen Intel processor with six cores (two Performance and four Efficient) and eight threads. On paper it’s considerably slower than the 15-watt 10-core (two Performance and eight Efficient) 12-thread Core i7-1255U in the Surface Pro 9.

In our benchmarks though the IdeaPad Duet 5i was quick enough for productivity tasks. It fell behind the Surface Pro 9 but not by as much as we expected with the biggest difference being in the intensive Cinebench R23 benchmark. Interestingly the IdeaPad was faster in the PCMark 10 Complete test of a mix of productivity media consumption and creative tasks.

Overall both tablets are fine productivity performers but creators should look elsewhere.

Display

The IdeaPad Duet 5i’s 12.4-inch IPS display has a 16:10 aspect ratio and 2560 x 1600 resolution compared to the 13.0-inch IPS 3:2 2880 x 1920 on the Surface Pro 9. Microsoft’s tablet benefits from a 120Hz refresh rate that makes Windows 11 smoother and provides a better inking experience particularly given the Surface Slim 2 pen’s support for haptic feedback.

In terms of quality though the IdeaPad’s display was much brighter and enjoyed wider colors and deeper contrast. The Surface Pro 9 had better color accuracy though. Both are fine for productivity and inking although again the Surface Pro 9 is the better digital writing and sketching platform.

Portability

As mentioned above the two tablets are similar in size and equally portable. They’re both much thicker and heavier with their keyboards attached.

The Surface Pro 9 has a larger battery at 60 watt-hours compared to the IdeaPad Duet 5i’s 50 watt-hours. Even so they had similar battery life lasting around eight hours in our web browsing test. Neither is likely to get you through a full day’s work on a single charge but their power bricks are light enough to carry around.

The IdeaPad Duet 5i holds its own

There’s no doubt that the Surface Pro 9 is the more advanced laptop with a 120Hz display haptic feedback in its Active Pen and an overall more refined experience. And it can be configured with more RAM and storage at a significantly higher price.

But the IdeaPad Duet 5i is a more affordable machine and it holds its own in terms of performance and battery life. What it comes down to is this: if a tablet is going to be your only laptop then the Surface Pro 9 is worth the price. But if you’re adding a tablet to a stable of other devices then the IdeaPad Duet 5i provides a budget option that’s quite appealing.

Transcription has become really common these days. The feature comes in handy in situations where you plan to take notes during an ongoing lecture or transcribe an interview etc.Whether you are a student or a working professional a good transcription tool can be really helpful at times. Thankfully Microsoft Word comes with one and it's baked right into the word processing tool by the name Transcribe.The transcribe feature in Microsoft Word works just like any other transcription tool. For instance you can enable the Transcribe tool and start speaking. It will automatically use the laptop’s or smartphone’s microphone to record the ongoing conversation and transcribe it in real-time.Apart from that it also allows users to record audio directly and then transcribe it along with the option to upload a pre-recorded audio file for transcription. The best part of Microsoft’s Dictation tool is that it can also identify the timestamp and transcribe the audio with it to make things easier for users.Just like any other transcription tool the Microsoft Word Transcribe feature also has certain limitations. First and foremost you’ll have to check if the language you are planning to is supported by Transcribe. Even if it supports the language it won’t give you 100% accurate results. We tried this feature by ourselves and it managed to return around 80% accurate results.Furthermore the efficiency and accuracy further deplete if there’s some surrounding noise. This means you’ll require a relatively quiet environment for better results.However the most important limitation is that the Transcribe tool isn’t available for the legacy Microsoft Word software.What users need to use Microsoft Word Transcribe toolFirst and foremost the feature is only available on the web version of Word. Also users need to have Microsoft 365 subscription for unlimited access to the feature.Microsoft Word also has a Dictation option which is somewhat similar to Transcribe feature except it is only meant to offer a simple speech-to-text feature. The good part here is that it works in real-time unlike the Transcribe feature which first records audio and then transcribes everything with a timestamp and speaker details.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvbWljcm9zb2Z0LW1heS1iZS1pbnRyb2R1Y2luZy1jaGVhcGVyLWFkLXN1cHBvcnRlZC14Ym94LWdhbWUtcGFzcy10aWVyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft may be introducing cheaper ad-supported Xbox Game Pass tiers,"It looks like Microsoft is considering introducing cheaper ad-supported tiers of its Xbox Game Pass.

That's according to a survey Microsoft recently circulated to players inviting views about the current Xbox Game Pass subscription and querying if we'd be willing to accept adverts if the subscription payment was lower.

An unsourced screenshot written in Spanish and shared on ResetEra (via VGC) alleges that Microsoft is surveying players and exploring a tier-like system - similar to that of Ubisoft+ and Sony's PS Plus - by inviting them to ""consider hypothetical subscriptions"".

The hypothetical family plan looks to be offering the full benefits of the current Xbox Game Pass service for five users across consoles and PC for €22 a month whilst the €3 plan would essentially give a single individual an Xbox Live Gold-like plan that delays access to Microsoft's first-party games for six months after release and would run adverts before you play a game from the XGP library.

ICYMI Xbox addressed its conspicuous absence from the recent The Game Awards promising that despite appearances 2023 will be an ""incredibly exciting year"" for its fans.

Resharing Microsoft's promotional Game Pass reel Xbox exec Aaron Greenberg stated the team has ""a lot planned to show and share"" for next year.

""Appreciate folks are eager to learn and see more"" he wrote at the time. ""Timing is always key but don't worry you will not have to wait too long for what's next from us.""

In this guide we’ll tell you how to acquire it and its ingredients.

What is the Blowhard Beverage?

Blowhard Beverage is a food item in Dragon Quest Treasures. It requires 3 Nectar 3 Silkblossom and 3 Wingtip Nectar to craft and can be prepared at the Canteen on your Island once you have unlocked that facility and purchased the recipe from the Emporium. It has the effect of increasing resistance to abilities and will often be one of the required items for recruiting Golems to your party.

How to unlock Blowhard Beverage in Dragon Quest Treasures

To unlock the Blowhard Beverage in Dragon Quest Treasures you will first need to unlock the Emporium facility on your Island. To do this speak to Miss Cecily and then travel to the Maneland where you will find Bricky Rix. Complete his sidequest by giving him a Flintstone (you can find these on The Paternoggin) and report to Miss Cecily on your Island. You will then be able to buy the recipe from the Emporium for 3300 coins.

After this you will need to travel to Wingswept Moors and speak to Chez Blancmange the large pink slime who will ask you to recruit a Ham Shamwitch. You can find these monsters in the surrounding area. If you are having trouble recruiting one to your team use a Buddy Bullet before defeating it to increase the chance it will want to join your party after battle. Completing her sidequest will unlock the Canteen back on your Island which will allow you to create a Blowhard Beverage.

Blowhard Beverage Ingredient Locations

As previously mentioned Dragon Quest Treasures’ Blowhard Beverage requires 3 Nectar 3 Silkblossom and 3 Wingtip Nectar to craft and you will need to gather these ingredients yourself. You can find them in the following locations:

Both Nectar and Wingtip Nectar can be gathered from purple flowers on Wingtip Moors. These are a common sight in the Swoopswamp Area so it is recommended that you search there. You may also wish to dispatch your monsters to this area for a chance that they will gather Wingtip Nectar and can send a party to the Snouterhorn Area of The Paternoggin for a chance of receiving Nectar once they return.

Silkblossom can be found in the Maneland and the Hinterquarters from grassy gathering points. There are slightly more of these points in the Maneland so it is recommended that you search there. You can also dispatch a team of monsters to either the Glacier Junction Area of The Hinterquarters or the Hotbreath Halt Area of The Maneland and they may bring back some when they return.

Dragon Quest Treasures is available now for Switch. Visit the official site here.

In early 2000s India was considered one of the fragile economies in the world. Fast forward to 2022 when the world is going through recession the Indian economy is resilient and standing strong. So what has changed?

India has rarely been number one in the world in anything—save failures. It was once number one beggar for foreign aid and food aid. For decades it was number one in the number of poor people. But how things have changed! In 2022 India has become global champion in an area that none could have predicted — stock market performance.

In mid-December the Sensex was up 7.5% since the start of 2022. But the MSCI index the most comprehensive global index had crashed 17%; the USA’s S&P 500 index was down 18%; Japan’s Nikkei 225 index was down 3%; Germany’s DAX was down 10%; China’s Shanghai’s Composite Index was down 10%; and Britain’s FTSE index was up 1.5%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2phY2trZWxseS8yMDIyLzEyLzE4L2ZvbGxvd2luZy10aGUtdGVjaC1zZWN0b3ItbGF5b2ZmLWNvbnRhZ2lvbi1oaXRzLXdhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWdvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtcGxhbnMtdG8tZG93bnNpemUtNDAwMC13aGl0ZS1jb2xsYXItd29ya2Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Following The Tech Sector Layoff Contagion Hits Wall Street: Goldman Sachs Plans To Downsize 4000 White Collar ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2022/12/18/following-the-tech-sector-layoff-contagion-hits-wall-street-goldman-sachs-plans-to-downsize-4000-white-collar-workers/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2phY2trZWxseS8yMDIyLzEyLzE4L2ZvbGxvd2luZy10aGUtdGVjaC1zZWN0b3ItbGF5b2ZmLWNvbnRhZ2lvbi1oaXRzLXdhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWdvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtcGxhbnMtdG8tZG93bnNpemUtNDAwMC13aGl0ZS1jb2xsYXItd29ya2Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS9uZXh0LzIwMjIvMTIvMTcvZ29sZG1hbi1zYWNocy1sYXlvZmZz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman to cut thousands of staff as Wall Street layoffs intensify -source,"By Saeed Azhar and Lananh Nguyen

NEW YORK - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is planning to cut thousands of employees to navigate a difficult economic environment a source familiar with the matter said.

The layoffs are the latest sign that cuts are accelerating across Wall Street as dealmaking dries up. Investment banking revenues have plunged this year amid a slowdown in mergers and share offerings marking a stark reversal from a blockbuster 2021 when bankers received big pay bumps.

Goldman Sachs had 49100 employees at the end of the third quarter after adding significant numbers of staff during the pandemic. Its headcount will remain above pre-pandemic levels the source said. The workforce stood at 38300 at the end of 2019 according to a filing.

The number of employees that will be affected by the layoffs is still being discussed and details are expected to be finalized early next year the source said.

The bank is weighing a sharp cut to the annual bonus pool this year a separate source familiar with the matter said. That contrasts with increases of 40% to 50% for top-performing investment bankers in 2021 Reuters reported in January citing people with direct knowledge of the matter.

""GS needs to show that its costs are as variable as its revenues especially after a year when it provided special rewards to top managers during the boom times"" wrote Mike Mayo a banking analyst at Wells Fargo.

""Goldman Sachs now needs to show that it can do the same when business is not as good and that they live up to the old Wall St. adage that they 'eat what they kill'"" he said in a note.

The company's stock fell 1.3% in afternoon trading alongside shares of JPMorgan & Chase Co and Morgan Stanley which fell 0.6% and 1.3% respectively.

Goldman shares have slumped almost 10% this year. But they have outperformed the broader S&P 500 bank index which is down 24% year to date.

CONSUMER BANK STRUGGLES

The latest plan would include hundreds of employees being cut from Goldman's consumer business a source said.

The bank signaled it was scaling back its ambitions for Marcus the loss-making consumer unit in October. Goldman also plans to stop originating unsecured consumer loans a source familiar with the move told Reuters earlier this week another sign it is stepping back from the business.

Chief Executive Officer David Solomon who took the helm in 2018 has tried to diversify the company's operations with Marcus. It was placed under the wealth business in October as part of a management reshuffle that also merged the trading and investment banking units.

Trading and investment banking -- the traditional drivers of Goldman's profit -- accounted for nearly 65% of its revenue at the end of the third quarter compared with 59% in the third quarter of 2018 when Solomon took the top job.

Semafor earlier on Friday reported that Goldman will lay off as many as 4000 people as the bank struggles to meet profit targets citing people familiar with the matter.

Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

The latest plans come after Goldman cut about 500 employees in September after pausing the annual practice for two years during the pandemic a source familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time.

The investment bank had first warned in July that it might slow hiring and reduce expenses.

KAHRAMANMARAŞ

Work has been initiated to open a 900 square meter area which is home to the remains of mosaics and villas dating back 1500 years during the excavations carried out in the ancient city of Germanicia in the southern province of Kahramanmaraş.

Kahramanmaraş Museum Director and head of excavations Safinaz Acıpayam said that the two areas of the ancient city which are currently open to visitors are 300 and 480 square meters in size and the area to be opened to visitors in 2023 will be 900 square meters including a 50 square-meter mosaic unearthed last year.

This year’s excavations in the ancient city of Germanicia which came to light during illegal excavations in the city’s Bağlarbaşı district in 2007 have been recently completed.

Excavations have been carried out in 35 different areas to date in order to uncover the ancient city. Acıpayam said that a 140 square-meter mosaic depicting a hunting scene was found in 2015 a 50 square meter mosaic depicting an open-air feast before the hunt was found in 2021 and an 18 square meter mosaic with geometric figures was found this year.

“In last year’s excavations work continued in the area that was previously excavated in 2015. This year works continued in different parcels within the same island. As of November we completed the 2022 excavations. We unearthed a floor mosaic of approximately 190 square meters in the area. In this floor mosaic there were sections from the hunting scenes performed by the Romans in different regions. In the excavations last year a floor mosaic with an open-air feast was found which is a continuation of the other mosaic. In this feast scene the host and guests sit in the middle and three women dance in the company of a figure playing the pan flute. There are also male servants and they make offerings. During the 2022 excavations a floor mosaic belonging to a different part of the villa rustica was found. This one is the continuation of that mosaic with a feast scene in the same area and this mosaic was 18 square meters. Again in 2021 some sections of the bathroom belonging to the same villa rustica were revealed. However our excavations are not concluded yet it is set to be completed in 2023” said Acıpayam.

The biggest area to open to visitors

Acıpayam stated that the area will be opened to visitors after the excavation works are completed and that the work for the opening has already started.

“The restoration and conservation of the mosaics will be carried out primarily during the opening works. Then external masonry roof system and walking paths will be built to protect the natural area from external factors and to allow the visitors to see the cultural assets comfortably. Lighting and camera systems will also be placed in the area” she said.

Stating that there are two open areas in the ancient city of Germanicia Acıpayam said one of these areas is 300 square meters and the other 480 square meters. “However the area to be opened soon is slightly larger than these and covers an area of 900 square meters” she added.

Acıpayam also noted that the mosaics of Germanicia were preserved and opened to visitors on-site.

“We see some destructions in the area; conservation and restoration of these destructions are carried out by expert restorers and then the masonry and roof systems are made to protect them from physical factors and the mosaics are protected 24 hours a day. The mosaics are also protected by night vision camera systems as well as security guards” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYXpiaWdtZWRpYS5jb20vcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUvdGhlLWZsYXRzLWF0LWphc3Blci1idWlsZC10by1yZW50LWNvbW11bml0eS1icmVha3MtZ3JvdW5kLWluLXByZXNjb3R0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Flats at Jasper build-to-rent community breaks ground in Prescott,"Mosaic and Atlantic Jasper have broken ground on The Flats at Jasper a new build-to-rent (BTR) community within the nationally-recognized Jasper master planned community in Prescott Valley Arizona. Atlantic Jasper developer of The Flats has partnered with Mosaic to build the 26.1-acre site which will include 240 horizontal apartment-style build-to-rent units. The project is expected to benefit from the strong housing market in the Prescott area providing a much needed transitional product type for out-of-town demand which makes up a large portion of the population.

“We approached the development of the Flats at Jasper with a long-term investment horizon in mind” said David Brown co-manager of Atlantic Jasper. “The units feature luxury fixtures and details a first-class clubhouse and other amenities designed to provide a competitive advantage in the Prescott market. Mosaic’s previous on-site experience and established area trade partners made them the ideal general contractor to deliver high-quality homes and amenities for the Flats at Jasper.”

This unique BTR community will offer numerous amenities including a state-of-the-art 5000 square foot clubhouse with a 24-hour workout facility and meeting spaces pool hot hub spa dog park and dog wash facilities along with open spaces and grilling stations throughout the community.

Mosaic has previously partnered with other regional home builders on the Jasper clean-energy community and seeks to build on this success with a new partner Atlantic Jasper.

“This is our third project in the Jasper community and the first build-to-rent neighborhood within the masterplan” said Alex Pollack Director of Partnerships at Mosaic. “Atlantic Jasper saw the need for a for-rent product type based on the strong regional demographics. Our pre-development services team and robust on-site experience within the community were the perfect fit for supporting their innovative vision of an ideal site layout standout architectural features and an ambitious and executable construction plan.”

The new site will offer four floor plans in a combination of single-family detached homes and duplexes ranging from 760 to 1039 square feet. The homes offer one-bedroom and one-bathroom or two-bedroom and two-bathroom options with one of the one-bedroom floor plans including a home office space. The community includes detached garages and residents will benefit from walking trails and other amenities within the master plan. Construction is anticipated to finish in 2025.",,,,,,,,,

AustralianSuper the country’s largest superannuation fund with A$263 billion ($175 billion) of AUM has expressed a downbeat outlook on global property markets while singling out Australia’s economy as relatively resilient when compared to other developed markets.

“In general we are cautious about the outlook for valuations across most sectors of property” Bevan Towning head of property at AustralianSuper in Melbourne told AsianInvestor.

He contrasted a bleak outlook for markets in the US and Europe with the fund’s more optimistic view on the sector in Australia.

“We are monitoring closely the increased negative sentiment in the UK and US relative to Australia and the more positive economic outlook in Australia relative to other major developed markets” he said.

But despite the concerns Towning said the fund had not made significant changes to its geographical allocations this year in the face of global economic headwinds higher inflation and higher interest rates. And he said the remained committed in the long term to property sectors including industrial despite significant spread compression in recent years.

“Longer term we still believe in the fundamental structural drivers of rents in the industrial sector” he said.

FALLING ALLOCATIONS

Global investors have enacted a sharp slowdown in property allocations in recent months as prices of listed property investments continue to fall this year.

According to the latest global capital trends report published by MSCI Real Assets a property data provider on November 3 global investors allocated $33 billion to APAC property in Q3 down 38% on a year earlier. CBRE’s Asia Pacific Q3 data published on November 13 showed a 20% fall in commercial real estate allocations to APAC over the period compared with a year earlier to $27.3 billion.

The $153 billion allocated to the US in Q3 by global investors was down 21% on a year earlier according to MSCI Real Assets. The $51 billion allocated to EMEA was down 44%.

As of 15 December the FTSE EPRA/Nareit Global Real Estate Index was down 21% year to date.

However these declines had not generally been reflected in the price of private assets partly since valuations by qualified appraisers consider previous deal prices many of which were agreed in 2021 according to Jeffrey Hobbs head of private markets at bfinance in London whose clients include a number of Asian sovereign pension and insurance funds.

“Prices have not come down immediately: we expect valuations to fall over the coming quarters. Investors in general are unlikely to see buying opportunities until they do” said Hobbs.

ANNOUNCED PLANS

Towning’s caution concerning European property is a departure from an aggressive plan of expansion into European real assets announced earlier this year by the fund. In February Damian Moloney AustralianSuper’s head of international investments said the fund would increase its European property allocation as part of a £15.4 billion ($24.3 billion) of new investment into European property infrastructure and direct private credit. A further £8 billion would go to these sectors in the UK by 2026.

To support the expansion Moloney said the fund planned to double the headcount in its London office from 50 to 100. In May Towning told AsianInvestor that AustralianSuper planned to make its first property investment in continental Europe within months and would begin investing in Asia properties within five years.

“[European investments will come] definitely within in a year into multiple assets and sectors probably with a number of different [investment] partners” he said at the time adding that the fund’s initial focus would be on leading Western European cities including Paris Frankfurt Berlin Madrid although the fund would consider looking further to Europe’s east too.

Towning said AustralianSuper’s current caution reflected the immediate investment outlook rather than any pressure the fund felt to rebalance its asset mix.

NO SELLING PRESSURE

“We have the benefit of being in a growing fund with strong net cashflows” said Towning. “This tends to mean that allocation changes that arise from changing valuations in other assets classes don't necessarily create pressure to sell.”

In many cases smaller Australian super funds as well as other pension and institutional funds across Asia are facing pressure to sell property and other real assets in order to rebalance portfolios following steep declines in the value of equity and fixed income assets in 2022.

“If equity or bonds are down is down 20 per cent and real assets are flat or up they will be well above their strategic allocation” said Hobbs of bfinance.

“The bigger and longer-term investors can withstand that but among those [whose asset mix] is more highly regulated or have nearer term liabilities some investors are having to redeem because they are over-allocated” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9pbmRpYS1idXNpbmVzcy9ob3ctaW5kaWEtd2VudC1mcm9tLWZyYWdpbGUtZml2ZS10by1zZW5zZXgtYXRpb25hbC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjMwNTUxNC5jbXPSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvaW5kaWEtYnVzaW5lc3MvaG93LWluZGlhLXdlbnQtZnJvbS1mcmFnaWxlLWZpdmUtdG8tc2Vuc2V4LWF0aW9uYWwvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2MzA1NTE0LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Morgan Stanley believes the next decade is India's,"Why Morgan Stanley believes the next decade is India's

In early 2000s India was considered one of the fragile economies in the world. Fast forward to 2022 when the world is going through recession the Indian economy is resilient and standing strong. So what has changed?

India has rarely been number one in the world in anything—save failures. It was once number one beggar for foreign aid and food aid. For decades it was number one in the number of poor people. But how things have changed! In 2022 India has become global champion in an area that none could have predicted — stock market performance.

In mid-December the Sensex was up 7.5% since the start of 2022. But the MSCI index the most comprehensive global index had crashed 17%; the USA’s S&P 500 index was down 18%; Japan’s Nikkei 225 index was down 3%; Germany’s DAX was down 10%; China’s Shanghai’s Composite Index was down 10%; and Britain’s FTSE index was up 1.5%.",,,,,,

NASDAQ stocks are stocks listed on stock exchange named 'The Nasdaq Stock Market' which is also commonly just known as the Nasdaq.

In terms of the Nasdaq it is the largest U.S. equities exchange by volume and also the first electronic stock exchange in the world given its founding in 1971. As an electronic stock exchange the Nasdaq has no psychical trading floors and is instead built on an automated network of computers that match buy and sell orders.

By being fully electronic there is potential for the Nasdaq to be faster than its main competitor The New York Stock Exchange which has a hybrid system that includes both an electronic trading network and a physical trading floor.

As an electronic only stock exchange it is perhaps more fitting that the Nasdaq is home to many big tech companies such as Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) whose stocks are listed on the exchange.

Given the growth of the technology industry in the last three decades the market capitalization of some of the stocks listed on the Nasdaq has increased substantially.

2022

Given high inflation in 2022 the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year. As a result of the interest rate increases Treasury yields have increased substantially and capital has moved from the tech sector into U.S. government bonds as a result.

As a result of the capital outflow the valuations of many growth companies and big tech companies listed on the Nasdaq have decreased.

The Nasdaq Composite which is a market capitalization weighted stock market index that includes nearly all of the stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange has decreased substantially as a result.

Given the decrease some leading blue chip stocks listed on the Nasdaq arguably trade below their intrinsic values which make them potentially 'cheap' stocks.

Given the uncertainty it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors however.

New data shared by S3 Partners could signal which stocks investors are betting heavily against.

What Happened: New data was shared by S3 Partners Managing Director Ihor Dusaniwsky on Twitter. Dusaniwsky shared data on many individual stocks including Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) along with several top ten lists.

According to data from S3 the top ten shorted stocks by percent of float are:

Carvana Co (NYSE:CVNA): 47.5%

(NYSE:CVNA): 47.5% Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY): 44.2%

Stocks to Watch: Dusaniwsky shared that large cap companies Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) are the top two shorted companies by dollars at $18.1 billion and $12.4 billion respectively.

While this is a large amount it’s also a low percentage of the companies' massive floats.

Taking a look at the two lists above readers can see that Beyond Meat MicroStrategy Upstart and Fisker appear on both lists suggesting they could be key short squeeze candidates.

Beyond Meat has seen shares fall with inflation fears hitting the company as meat alternatives are often priced higher than traditional meat products. MicroStrategy is a holder of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and has seen shares fall and short interest rise as investors bet against the leading cryptocurrency.

Now Chikli’s story is on Netflix. “The Masked Scammer” a gripping documentary that tells the story of the former Ashdod-dwelling charmer is currently the number 10 most-watched film on Netflix in Israel.

Chikli is serving a 11-year prison sentence after being convicted by a French court in 2020 for costing companies around the world $1.8 billion in just over two years. At the time he lived openly in Israel but was later captured and extradited to France.

The linchpin of the captivating film is Chikli’s ex-wife Shirli Chikli who tells her story for the first time though the drama has played out in the media for years.

“The first mission was to convince Shirli to come on board” said Oren Rosenfeld the Israeli producer hired by the UK production company that worked with Netflix France to create the film.

“The Masked Scammer” is the latest in a trend of true crime documentaries said Rosenfeld and like “The Tinder Swindler” about a man who duped women into thinking he was the son of diamond tycoon Lev Leviev it puts Israel on the map albeit not in “the most positive way” he added.

“It’s harder now to sell stories about Israel or Israelis as the heroes” he said. “But this sells.”

For Rosenfeld who recently won Emmys for “Inside the Battle for Jerusalem” about the forced expulsion of Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah the challenge in “The Masked Scammer” was finding and convincing Shirli Chikli to tell her side of the story.

“She got many offers and didn’t want to talk and I took it on as a mission to get it done” said Rosenfeld. “It’s about building trust and friendship and a relationship.”

Rosenfeld slowly got to know Chikli and her life now in Israel as a single mother to four young daughters her tanning salon and her ultimate passion which is to work full-time as a DJ.

The documentary doesn’t explicitly discuss the couple’s marital status — they recently got divorced — or their four daughters. Neither does the Israeli-born Shirli Chikli rip her ex-husband to shreds.

“Her life isn’t easy” said Rosenfeld. “He fooled her big time. She’s not innocent but she’s a down-to-earth person and she’s hurt from all this.”

She met Gilbert Chikli by chance in Israel in the early 2000s as he was running away from the French police who were on the hunt for him following an earlier set of scams.

She’s honest in the documentary about her hunt for a rich husband but the pair — there’s a 19-year age difference — seem happy at their wedding and in their Ashdod mansion as they created a family shown through video footage and stills.

Shirli Chikli calls her ex-husband “an angel who only wanted to do good things for her” though she’d been warned that the police were after him.

The production keeps the French side of the story going with stills and very frank interviews with Chikli’s first female partner in love and scams a French woman also named Shirli. There are also interviews with his brother and friends all of whom attest to Chikli’s strong desire to escape the poverty of his childhood.

Chikli ran his most audacious scam from Israel impersonating Le Drian with a silicone mask and videocalls to the rich and powerful with a story of French nationals trapped in Mali a need for privacy and a quick infusion of cash.

Chikli famously hit up spiritual leader and prince Aga Khan for more than 20 million euros. But it was a call to a Paris executive Sophie Grenier who at the time was the financial director of France’s chamber of commerce and industry that ultimately brought the scammer down.

Grenier brought in the police after becoming suspicious of certain details and spelling errors in Chikli’s forged documents.

Chikli fled for Ukraine and was arrested in Kyiv from where he was extradited to France. He remains in a French jail.

As for Shirli Chikli the Netflix documentary has freed her said Rosenfeld. It gave her a certain amount of fame that she plans on seizing to help build her DJing career.

Her divorce from Gilbert Chikli was finalized last month.

“Her sense of victimhood continues” said Rosenfeld. “But she’s getting a bit of closure out of this.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5ZnkuY29tL3N5Znktd2lyZS9uZXctZmVhci1zdHJlZXQtdHJpbG9neS1uZXRmbGl4LWRpcmVjdG9yLWNobG9lLW9rdW5v0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3lmeS5jb20vc3lmeS13aXJlL25ldy1mZWFyLXN0cmVldC10cmlsb2d5LW5ldGZsaXgtZGlyZWN0b3ItY2hsb2Utb2t1bm8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get ready to return to 'Fear Street' as Netflix commissions second trilogy from 'Watcher' director,"Netflix is heading back to Fear Street. SYFY WIRE has confirmed the streaming giant will enter production on a second trilogy of films inspired by the best-selling YA book series from prolific horror author R.L. Stine. Up-and-coming director Chloe Okuno (Watcher) is on board to helm the trio of movies with Chernin Entertainment returning to produce. Above the Line was first to report the news.

No plot details are known at this time but it was only a matter of time until Netflix decided to continue the franchise given the viewership success of the first three titles which told an interconnected tale of terror across three retro time periods: 1994 1978 and 1666.

""The stories within R.L. Stine's books are centered around the idea of infinite repeatability"" director Leigh Janiak (Honeymoon) remarks in the official Fear Street press notes. ""Every story takes place in this town called Shadyside and focuses on a different person who lives on Fear Street but the films aren't a direct adaptation. The spirit of the books is definitely infused throughout — it's embodied in our story our characters and the overall craziness that ensues.""

Shot back-to-back the titles were released over a period of three weeks in July 2021. SYFY WIRE's own Trent Moore praised the novel experiment calling it ""a clever surprising project that revels in the past.""

He continued: ""It’s throwback horror with a cutting-edge release like we’ve never seen. But none of it would work if the movies weren’t ya know good. Thankfully Janiak has kept a deft directorial hand on the story and tone of this saga weaving something with the episodic cliffhanger vibe of must-see TV with the scope and thrills of blockbuster horror.""

The first trilogy of Fear Street films is now streaming on Netflix and features the talents of Sadie Sink Maya Hawke Ashley Zukerman Gillian Jacobs and more. All three features are rated R and currently hold between an 83 to 89 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes.

""Every film made No. 1 on Netflix. It was amazing"" Stine told us over a Zoom conversation earlier this year. ""I was shocked by those films [because] they’re R-rated. Even my life isn't R rated. It was all teenagers being slashed to bits.""

In February 2020 as Disney's head of streaming Kevin Mayer was in the line of succession for CEO. But Mayer seen here on Sept. 29 2022 and colleagues were stunned when Iger announced Bob Chapek would replace Iger immediately. Bryan van der Beek | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Still Iger said during a Disney town hall last month he isn't focused on M&A for the time being. Candle Media has acquired intellectual property assets including Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine production company and Moonbug which owns the animated kids series ""CoComelon."" Iger's calling card as CEO is acquiring IP including Pixar LucasFilm and Marvel. ""CoComelon"" could fit well within Disney+. But choosing Mayer or Staggs would also imply Iger made an error in judgment the first time. Executive 3: Iger extends his contract There's been lots of speculation over who Iger will choose as his successor. History suggests he has a hard time leaving the role of Disney CEO. So perhaps the most obvious answer as to who he will pick is: no one (at least not yet).

The retired Iger seen here on Dec. 6 2022 privately continued to talk with past and present Disney executives about Chapek and the company with several urging him to return to Disney according to people familiar with those conversations. David Dee Delgado | Reuters

This executive said Iger 71 will extend his contract beyond Dec. 31 2024 his current end date and stay as Disney CEO for years to come. Executive 4: Disney CFO Christine McCarthy will leave McCarthy has become the talk of Hollywood in recent weeks after CNBC and other publications reported she went behind former Disney CEO Bob Chapek's back to the Disney board to give him an effective vote of no confidence leading to his ouster.

Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has spent the past year cutting costs to slim down the merged WarnerMedia-Discovery and service the company's nearly $50 billion in debt. Zaslav's cost cutting moves haven't yet convinced investors he's on the right track to returning the company to glory. Warner Bros. Discovery shares have fallen about 60% since the April merger. Existing investors will lose patience with Zaslav and the board and will demand changes said one executive. It's possible an activist will take a stake in the company but it's even more likely long-time shareholders will lose confidence in his strategy when it doesn't produce a notable valuation bump in 2023 the executive predicted. Executive 7: The cost of sports rights will peak Live sports rights have been the lifeblood of the legacy pay TV industry for decades. National Football League games continue to dominate ratings. College football and NBA playoff games frequently draw enormous live audiences compared to almost everything else on cable all year. But media companies are now focused on building their streaming businesses as replacements for traditional pay TV. Consumers buy these services a la carte meaning non-sports fans don't have to buy services that include sports. Limited audiences combined with a legacy media industry intent on focusing on profits and cost cutting could end the trend of live sports commanding big rights increases. The NBA will still command a big increase as legacy pay TV continues to exist — primarily supported by sports. Those rights will likely be renewed in 2023. But in five to seven years it's possible traditional TV will be totally eliminated. That will lead to an environment where there are fewer bidders for sports rights dropping the price for sports across the board said this executive. Perhaps the NFL remains an outlier due to its popularity said the executive. But every other sport's prospects look bleak said the person. Executive 8: Paramount Global will sell possibly for parts This is our first repeat from last year. ""I love Shari [Redstone] but ViacomCBS is not long for this world as it stands today"" said a media executive last year.

This grand waterfront property caused a stir nationwide and around the world when it hit the market this year. And another wave of interest when it fetched a record-breaking $8.533m.

In an unrivalled 1ha-plus riverside location the sprawling five-bedroom home was aptly described as a “generational asset”.

Alongside the ‘90s-built large family house there was a match-size tennis court a huge garage glorious gardens multiple titles a couple of extra dwellings ready for some TLC plus river city and mountain views.

For Knight Frank residential sales consultant Brad Stephens the opportunity to market and sell the home at No.10 Howrah Point Ct was “absolutely” a career highlight.

To be trusted with a property of this stature was a privilege Mr Stephens said.

“It might not be ‘once in a career’ but a property like this only comes along so often” he said.

“It is unusual that a property like this will hit the market but when they do they represent a once in a generation opportunity.”

While Mr Stephens stayed mum about where the buyers were from he did say it was purchased by a family.

“They are a young family who appreciate the privacy that the property offers with room for their children to grow up in and enjoy the open space” he said.

Through the campaign. Domi Riviere was inspected about 30 times and attracted some 120 inquiries from all over the world locals and interstate buyers too.

Mr Stephens said it was not uncommon for Tasmania’s best homes to attract global interest and for No.10 that included inquiries from the USA the Asia-Pacific region South East Asia and a mix of expat and internationally-based buyers.

“We had high expectations and it met them” he said.

In November Mr Stephens took a portion of the property — Lot 13 and 14 Howrah Point Court — to market and sold the 1661sqm of beachfront land.

He said the property offered an “increasingly rare opportunity” to buy genuine waterfront land and it attracted a huge level of interest particularly from local buyers who loved the position and the blank canvas on which to build their dream home.

Tasmania’s second most expensive sale of the year was No.20 Clarke Ave Battery Point which sold for $5.45m followed by No.11 Beach Rd Sandy Bay at a price that is currently undisclosed.

PropTrack senior economist Eleanor Creagh said across the country waterfront beachfront and coastal property was always popular and often fetched the highest prices.

“Buyers for the waterside homes are oftentimes willing to pay a premium price for these special properties” she said.

While the sharp rise in interest rates has “rebalanced” the market from last year’s extreme growth and weighed on borrowing capacities Ms Creagh said there will always be outliers.

“These buyers who can pay top dollar for homes in the prestige end of the market are well placed to withstand the turn in market conditions” she said.

Real Estate Institute of Tasmania figures show Tasmania’s top sales have been in the multimillion dollar range since 2014.

In 2013 the top price was $1.835m and in 2012 the No.1 sale was $1.75m.

Ms Creagh said this was a sign of how far Tasmanian property had come in a short period of time.

“We saw extraordinary growth in home prices particularly during the pandemic period and Hobart and regional Tasmania were standout performers” she said.

“While Hobart home values are down 2.9 per cent from their peak earlier this year they are still 44 per cent higher than pre-pandemic levels.”

(Photo by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images)

Football Australia boss James Johnson has vowed that Melbourne Victory fans responsible for one of the most shameful nights in the history of Australian football will be severely dealt with.

Saturday night’s Melbourne derby at AAMI Park was abandoned for safety reasons after Melbourne City goalkeeper Thomas Glover and referee Alex King were both assaulted by Victory fans who invaded the pitch after 20 minutes.

What was originally planned to be a walkout by active supporter groups from both the Victory and City in protest to the decision to sell the A-League grand final to Sydney turned nasty and dangerous when Victory fans let off flares behind the City goal and threw them onto the field.

Glover seemed to throw one of the flares back towards the Victory fans. Seconds later Victory fans stormed the pitch with one hitting Glover in the face with a bin.

Glover was rushed off the field with a cut face while referee King was also hit in the face.

Play did not resume with King calling off the match less than half an hour later after consulting with FA officials.

FA chief executive officer Johnson said an investigation into the matter would be opened and that the culprits would be harshly dealt with.

Lifetime bans are likely for some Victory supporters.

“It was disgusting behaviour and disgraceful scenes” an angry and disappointed Johnson told News Corp Australia.

“A full investigation will take place and those responsible will face the harshest of punishments.”

FA later issued a statement saying the match was abandoned “in accordance with Law 5.3 of the Laws of the Game in order to protect the integrity of the match.”

“Such behaviour has no place in Australian football with a full Football Australia investigation to commence immediately where strong sanctions (will) be handed down” the statement said.

Melbourne Victory has condemned fabs of the club that invaded the pitch in Saturday night’s Melbourne derby and assaulted Melbourne City goalkeeper Tom Glover referee Alex King and a cameraman.

In a statement posted a few hours after the abandonment of the match for safety reasons the Victory said it was “devastated” and apologised to Glover King and the cameraman.

“The club unequivocally condemns the actions of fans at Saturday night’s match against Melbourne City at AAMI Park” the Victory statement said.

“The actions that occurred that saw spectators enter the pitch and injure a Melbourne City FC player an official and a Network Ten cameraman are not acceptable under any circumstance and have no place in football.

“The security and welfare of everyone involved in a football match is paramount and the club will not accept this behaviour.

“The club would like to formally apologise to Tom Glover match official Alex King and the camera operator as well as all players officials and those who witnessed the appalling behaviour.

“Melbourne Victory would like to reiterate there is no place in football for what was witnessed tonight.”

The Victory said the conduct would not be “tolerated” and that the club AAMI Park officials and Victoria Police would undertake a full investigation into the incident.

Players’ union Professional Football Australia have called for the “strongest possible sanctions” to be slapped on the Melbourne Victory fans responsible for assaulting Melbourne City goalkeeper Tom Glover referee Alex King and a member of the broadcast staff.

“The PFA has met with the players involved in tonight’s match and will continue to ensure they are provided with the full support and resources of the PFA” a PFA statement said.

“We acknowledge the courage of players club staff and referees who came to the aid of each other in circumstances that no one should ever be exposed to.”

Socceroos great Robbie Slater was unsure how Australian football would recover from its night of shame.

“This was supposed to be a time when we were celebrating the wonderful achievements of our Socceroos at the World Cup and now this has happened” a saddened Slater said.

“I don’t know how we recover from this. How did it come to this? This could be the start of a slow death for the game.

“There should have just been a walkout not an invasion of the pitch the flares and the assaults.”

While not condoning the incident Slater said the situation could have been avoided had the Australian Professional Leagues board not made the decision to sell A-League grand finals to Sydney for the next three years.

“There’s no excuse for what the fans have done there but this would never have arisen if what happened during the week with the grand finals hadn’t have happened” Slater said.

“The APL can’t take the blame for idiots invading the pitch but they only invaded the pitch because of the current (grand final) situation which needs to be investigated.

“The lack of transparency and consultation in their decision has led to this.”

Socceroos’ World Cup hero Craig Goodwin has described the violence that forced the abandonment of the Melbourne derby as “heartbreaking”.

Goodwin had been one of the prominent voices opposed to the Australian Professional Leagues board decision to sell the A-League grand final to Sydney for the next three years.

Walkouts during matches this weekend had been planned by clubs’ active supporters groups in protest to the decision.

However on a night of shame for Australian football Melbourne Victory fans threw flares and invaded the pitch at AAMI Park with Melbourne City goalkeeper Tom Glover and referee Alex King assaulted.

“Extremely disappointing. Regardless of what has happened this is not the way to respond and only gives the game a bad look.” Goodwin tweeted.

“What’s most frustrating is that this is a time where the football community has to stick together and it’s heartbreaking to see what’s just happened.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9uZXRiYWxsL2dpbmEtcmluZWhhcnQtYmFja2ZsaXAtbGVmdC1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLW5ldGJhbGwtb24taXRzLWtuZWVzL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNmJiYWIyYjhhMThjNzMyZWI3ODI4YTlmOGQ1ZGZhNTLSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3cy5jb20uYXUvc3BvcnQvbmV0YmFsbC9naW5hLXJpbmVoYXJ0LWJhY2tmbGlwLWxlZnQtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1uZXRiYWxsLW9uLWl0cy1rbmVlcy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzZiYmFiMmI4YTE4YzczMmViNzgyOGE5ZjhkNWRmYTUyP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rinehart left Aussie netball on its knees,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/sport/netball/gina-rinehart-backflip-left-australian-netball-on-its-knees/news-story/6bbab2b8a18c732eb7828a9f8d5dfa52 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9uZXRiYWxsL2dpbmEtcmluZWhhcnQtYmFja2ZsaXAtbGVmdC1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLW5ldGJhbGwtb24taXRzLWtuZWVzL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNmJiYWIyYjhhMThjNzMyZWI3ODI4YTlmOGQ1ZGZhNTLSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3cy5jb20uYXUvc3BvcnQvbmV0YmFsbC9naW5hLXJpbmVoYXJ0LWJhY2tmbGlwLWxlZnQtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1uZXRiYWxsLW9uLWl0cy1rbmVlcy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzZiYmFiMmI4YTE4YzczMmViNzgyOGE5ZjhkNWRmYTUyP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi3AFodHRwczovL3d3dy5za3luZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9hdXN0cmFsaWEtbmV3cy9zcG9ydC9wb2xpY2UtY29uZmlybS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLWludG8tYWxlYWd1ZS1waXRjaC1pbnZhc2lvbi1hcy1mYW5zLWFuZC1wbGF5ZXJzLWRlY2xhcmUtcmlvdC10aGUtZGFya2VzdC1kYXktaW4tYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1mb290YmFsbC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2ZkZjBkYTYwOThiNGE1NzJhODAzMTY1OTkxZTUzZDVj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police confirm investigation into A-League pitch invasion as fans and commentators declare riot the ‘darkest day’ in ...,"Victoria Police has made no arrests after more than 150 fans stormed the pitch at the A-League’s Melbourne Derby on Saturday night.

The shocking display from balaclava-clad Melbourne Victory supporters saw the much-anticipated derby against Melbourne City abandoned.

After only 20-minutes between 150 and 200 fans invaded the pitch carrying flares and torn off components of the stadium fencing.

One fan left Melbourne City’s Tom Glover bleeding from the nose after they threw a metal bucket at the goalkeeper’s face.

Glover later received attention for a concussion and was then transferred to hospital.

Referee Alex King was also caught up in the fracas and received a nasty cut to his right eyebrow.

Victoria Police has confirmed an investigation is ongoing but said no arrests had yet been made over the disappointing incident.

“Victoria Police is disappointed with the behaviour of some supporters at Saturday nights A-League men’s game between Melbourne City and Melbourne Victory in Melbourne” a statement said.

“The match was abandoned after approximately 150-200 Melbourne Victory supporters entered the field of play.

“A Melbourne City player and official were injured during the incursion and a cameraman was injured by a flare. These incidents are being investigated by police.

“Supporters left the field after a short period of time and the crowd left the stadium. There were no other incidents reported to police and at this stage no arrests have been made.”

The horrifying saga was ignited after fans from both clubs began throwing flares onto the pitch.

The Melbourne City goalkeeper then threw two projectiles back into the crowd which triggered a mass reaction from the Victory fans.

The up to 200-strong contingent then flooded the field and descended on Glover as dozens began tearing off parts of the goal frame.

The incident has been condemned by commentators players and fans while Football Australia boss James Johnson told News Corp Australia Victory fans displayed “disgusting behaviour and disgraceful scenes”.

“A full investigation will take place and those responsible will face the harshest of punishments” he said.

The chaos occurred following ongoing protests against the Australian Professional Leagues’ decision to sell the grand final hosting rights to Destinations NSW for a reported eight-figure sum across three years.

But News Corp senior manager for sports live streaming said despite fans’ legitimate concerns over the grand final decision violence was “never in anyway acceptable” calling the events “disgusting”.

Commentator Andy Harper slammed the “anarchistic thugs” over the violence as Central Coast Mariners goalkeeper Danny Vukovic said the incident meant “our game is in tatters”.

“Irreparable damage done. Darkest day for football in Australia” Vukovic wrote on Twitter.

Highly respected commentator Simon Hill said the event left him “very sad and angry”.

“And our fall from grace is complete. Like the World Cup never happened” Hill said on Twitter.

Socceroos World Cup hero and Adelaide United Captain Craig Goodwin also decried the outrageous attempt at a protest.

“Extremely disappointing. Regardless of what has happened this is not the way to respond and only gives the game a bad look” Goodwin said.

Melbourne City’s organised fan group unleashed on their victory counterparts after the two firms had originally planned to stage a 20th minute walk-out in protest to the grand final controversy.

“What happened tonight was nothing short of disgraceful @originalstylemelbourne you should hang your heads in shame” the statement from the City Terrace group read.

“You took our message and turned it into an act of violence that will be talked about in the footballing world for months. You have thrown the entirety of our protest into jeopardy.

“Football is our beautiful game a game we have nurtured for generations. Tonight is not what football is about.

The university with its main campus in Melbourne bestowed 1067 degrees during the services with about 740 students from 43 countries attending the ceremonies in person.

“Our professors our students and yes our alumni are continually seeking new discoveries and constantly pursuing new innovations to make our world a better place” Robert L. King interim president of Florida Tech said during the ceremonies.

“They have done this for decades and you will now extend that proud legacy. So work hard keep learning and perhaps most importantly keep contributing to your field of study your career your communities and the world.”

The keynote address was delivered by Mike Sole a vice-president at NextEra Energy the parent company of Florida Power and Light and a Florida Tech alumnus. NextEra based in Juno Beach generated third-quarter revenue of $6.72 billion the company reported.

Sole told the graduates to make a commitment to excellence; do the right thing; and treat people with respect. He also told students to not be averse to taking risks.

“Often we are taught that ‘risk’ is a bad word but in reality it is something that we manage in our day-to-day lives. It is inherent in what we do to succeed and playing it safe with your career doesn’t always pay off. You must be prepared to manage your ‘risk vs reward’ decision-making because sooner or later you will be facing some tough decisions.”

Too much plush underfoot and you run the risk of an unstable stance for squats and other modalities. Too weak of an upper and you can wind up replacing your workout kicks as regularly as you would your protein powder stock.

Thankfully though there are some training sneakers answering any all and inquiries delivering exceptional comfort durability and performance with each set or step.

Over the years Nike has been one of the most popular shoe brands not just in training footwear but sneakers in general and its Metcon lineup has answered the call of plenty gym-goers with security workout-boosting perks and (of course) style. The brand recently unveiled its Metcon 8 lineup creating a fresh new take on Nike’s flagship training stable.

But does this all-new silhouette carry the torch of previous iterations? Do the features and design cater to both novice and veteran athletes alike? Having been a fan of the previous Metcon 7 I laced up these latest trainers to see whether this new kick could live up to its predecessor’s reputation. Across multiple strength training and CrossFit workouts I tested the shoe’s durability and stability as well as highlighted the new features that Nike added to the profile.

Here’s what you can expect from the all-new Nike Metcon 8s.

Cristiano Ronaldo earns $24 Million per year from Nike

Nike awarded Cristiano Ronaldo a lifetime deal in 2016. Ronaldo makes $24 million every year from the deal. Although he is still far away from the billionaire status earned by the NBA stars Michael Jordan and LeBron James who have a lifetime deal with Nike.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nike (@nike)

The deal is similar to that of LeBron James where Ronaldo will get $1 billion. Before leaving Manchester United with mutual consent Ronaldo was the third highest-paid athlete behind Lionel Messi and King James. It is believed Ronaldo will surpass the billion-dollar mark when he retires. He potentially earns between 100-150 million USD from salaries and endorsements every year.

Ronaldo makes around $50 million in revenue from endorsements. Nike is the main sponsor of the soccer star. He also works with Altice Herbalife DAZN LiveScore TAG Heuer and Clear Shampoo amongst others. In addition his endeavors significantly contribute to the player’s revenue. His personal investments include CR7 Fragrances Pestana CR7 Lifestyle Hotels 7EGEND and CR7 Fitness to name a few.

Where will Ronaldo play in January 2023?

The interview with Piers Morgan has changed things for Cristiano Ronaldo. Manchester United ended the contract with the player with mutual consent and Ronaldo is a free agent now. Bayern and PSG chief’s recent comments mean they are out of the race to sign the 37-year-old star.

However during the World Cup a blockbuster deal from the Saudi Arabian club was in the headlines. The deal potentially was 200 million USD a year for two and a half years. Many reports suggested the player accepted the deal until the player himself cleared the air. He denied signing the deal and is looking for a new club.

Cristiano Ronaldo still wants to play in Europe with a club playing in the UEFA Champions League. Recently he trained at the Real Madrid facility for a few days to keep himself in the shape. It will be interesting to see where Cristiano Ronaldo ends up playing in January 2023.

As one of the most widely-anticipated collaborations of the past few months the Jarritos x Nike SB Dunk Low is set to cement the revitalized silhouette’s dominance throughout 2023 by way of its continued collaborative efforts with obscure yet effective partners. Having received our first official look at the upcoming pair late last month one specific and customizable embellishment had been left unknown until now the inclusion of tear-away uppers.

Coated in crisp white leathers filling its vamp midfoot panel and heel a tan burlap canvas envelops the stitched-on overlays while its green-tinted midfoot Swoosh deviates from its tonal surroundings. Placing a precision knife in the box the tool can be used to rip away the latter textile to reveal vibrant orange suede underlays pouring out from the Mexican brand’s jug insignia affixed to the heel. Branded Jarritos-inspired Nike SB logos render an appearance atop the tongue and heel tabs coordinating a lasting color match to the iconic Mandarin sodas orange white and green combination at the lace aglets and sectioned tread underfoot.

The identity of the highest bidder remained a mystery for years until it was finally revealed that the buyer was none other than the groundbreaking Sandy Bodecker. His influence on skateboarding and Nike can’t be overstated and this auction tale is just another piece of that legacy. We don’t say he’s the man who put the SB in Nike SB for no reason.

Over recent times Nike’s Dunk Low has been one of its most popular silhouettes with high-profile collaborations — such as the recently-dropped Lebron James version — and general releases keeping fans consistently engaged and excited for what’s to come next. For the Dunk Low Remastered the Swoosh is now offering a revitalized version of the shoe — and it heavily leans into the current trend of deconstructed looks.

With this in mind Nike’s latest version of the Dunk Low comes in a “White/Light Silver-Mint Foam-Pink Foam-Light Smoke Grey” colorway and features a revamped appearance with a mesh composition that is reinforced with leather overlays. Additionally the sneaker also includes padded tongues with pull tabs and exposed tags while modified rubber tooling which is slightly thicker than the same feature on the traditional Dunk rounds out the design.

You can take a closer look at the Nike Dunk Low Remastered “Mint Foam” above and it will be available on the official Nike website and with select retailers in the coming weeks for $120 USD.

Pierce is out as President of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) following his election defeat by Edward A. Hall who will take office Jan. 1. Although an alleged impropriety involving outside influence by a socialist organization would have permitted under union bylaws a revote Pierce chose to retire instead and urged that Hall be installed by acclimation as the new BLET president.

Pierce now 64 was first elected BLET president in December 2010 in the union’s first one-member-one vote election. Prior to 2010 BLET national officers were elected by delegates representing each of its some 500 divisions (known as locals in most unions). Subsequently unchallenged Pierce was reelected by acclamation in 2014 and 2018 for successive four-year terms.

Only 27% of the union’s 30614 eligible members bothered to cast ballots in this most recent BLET national officer election giving Hall a 509-vote victory—4331-3822. An allegation that BLET’s election rules had been violated by an outside organization led a BLET Protest Committee to order a new election but Pierce in a Dec. 16 letter to the membership said he would decline to run a second time.

While the BLET has not publicly identified the nature of the election protest Railway Age was told it involved alleged improper support provided Hall by the World Socialist Web Site (WSWS) which describes itself as an “online newspaper of the international Trotskyist movement” and is published by the International Committee of the Fourth International. Leon Trotsky (1879-1940) was a Russian Marxist revolutionary.

BLET’s Vice President-Elect Mark Wallace (formerly a BLET senior officer on Norfolk Southern) wrote in pre-election support for Pierce that Hall “has embraced help from an anti-union non-BLET group [that] is determined on destroying the very fabric of our union movement.” The WSWS rejected the Hall support allegation saying “the WSWS has never endorsed Hall.” Hall allegedly embraced WSWS materials in his campaign effort.

By retiring from union office and now lending his support to Hall Pierce is attempting to safeguard the BLET and other rail unions from the airing of divisive rhetoric. All of rail labor is seeking to heal following a contentious round of national contract collective bargaining that ended with Congress imposing on four of 12 rail labor unions a Tentative Agreement ratified by eight of them including the BLET.

Visible in Pierce’s rear-view mirror are relatively recent scandals involving his predecessors. BLET President Don Hahs was suspended from office in 2007 following allegations he embezzled almost $60000 used to purchase sporting-events tickets and to pay travel expenses for his spouse. There were no criminal charges.

Hahs’ successor Edward W. Rodzwicz was criminally charged for accepting bribes from personal injury attorneys in exchange for helping them solicit clients among on-the-job injured locomotive engineers. He was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison.

Rail unions typically name a dozen or more Designated Legal Counsel who are given honorary union membership and allowed in attendance at otherwise closed union meetings and recommended by the union to handle individual personal injury lawsuits brought under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA).

When two presidents—Byron A. Boyd and Charles L. Little—of BLET rival United Transportation Union (now the Transportation Division of the International Association of Sheet Metal Air Rail and Transportation Workers or SMART-TD) were each sentenced in 2004 to 24 months in federal prison on charges of bribery and racketeering Boyd blamed the FELA arrangement.

Prior to sentencing Boyd told the court that some attorneys had paid as much as $30000 to be granted preferred access to injured union members. “The system has gone on for generations and the system goes on as we stand here today” Boyd said. There are no allegations of FELA improprieties in Pierce’s election loss to Hall.

These unrelated rail union scandals are noteworthy as they caused at the time considerable membership unrest. Pre-Twitter and pre-Facebook Internet-based social media lit up at the time for weeks with derogatory comments by union members toward their elected leadership.

Moreover the BLET is aligned since 2004 with the once organized-crime-riddled Teamsters Union. It was only in 2020 that a Department of Justice Independent Review Board ended a five-year phase out of Teamsters Union internal affairs oversight dating to a 1989 consent decree allowing the union to avoid prosecution under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. (The federal prosecutor who subsequently became New York City’s mayor was the now disgraced Rudy Giuliani.) Current Teamsters President Sean O’Brien in office only since March 2022 and long active with Teamsters reform efforts stood alongside Pierce at the union’s October national convention offering praise.

Pierce served as chief negotiator for 10 of the 12 rail unions and all 12 during the final weeks of what were more than 30 months of direct negotiations on contract amendments setting wages benefits and work rules. Pierce repeatedly took no position on the Tentative Agreement he largely shepherded and personally signed as he walked a tightrope while eyeing his own reelection bid.

Hall made that Tentative Agreement the central issue in his election challenge to Pierce saying “It is clear to me that the national membership is dissatisfied with our leadership and the decisions made by them when it comes to a National Agreement.”

The WSWS opposed the Tentative Agreement as concessionary giving a public platform to members of all 12 rail labor unions to express their opposition to what the WSWS termed “the Biden-sponsored contract settlement.”

Hall responding to concerns that he had not previously held a national union leadership post said “The question that every BLET member should be asking is not if leadership is seasoned and experienced but rather has our leadership effectively done their job.”

Prior to being hired by Southern Pacific (now part of Union Pacific) in El Paso Tex. in 1995 Hall was a corrections officer in Houston. After earning a community college degree in accounting and computer science he partnered with his brother in real estate acquisition rental and management.

Hall was promoted to locomotive engineer in Tucson Ariz. in 1998 and elected a BLET division officer in 2010 rising to First Vice Local Chairperson for Division 28 in Tucson.

Pierce began his rail career in 1977 on Burlington Northern (now BNSF) in Lincoln Neb. as a maintenance-of-way worker and then locomotive fireman rising to locomotive engineer in 1981. He became a BLET Division 98 officer in 1991 a general chairperson in 2001 and a BLET vice president in 2008.

He is also the chairman Northern Traditional Council South South and South East and chairman Northern Community Abia…

Yaro Danladi is the Sarkin Hausawa Abia. He is also the chairman Northern Traditional Council South South and South East and chairman Northern Community Abia State. We first met many years ago in Umuahia while doing a similar story.

Eket road is one of the main hubs of the Hausa community in Umuahia where Sarkin Hausawa’s office is located.

Mahdi Adamu provides a definition of the position of Sarkin Hausawa in his The Hausa Factor in West African History. According to him if at the end of the journey they settle down in a ‘foreign community’ they would choose a political leader among them with the title of Sarkin Hausawa to be the liaison officer between them and the community where they settle.

Since 1936

On the beginning of the Hausa community in Abia Sarki Danladi said “Our forefathers came down here from all parts of the North to trade in fish cattle and all kinds of farm produce such as yams and onions.

“From the story I heard from my late father the Hausa began to come to Umuahia in 1936 from Kano. I was born here. My father was born here too. My wife is from Abia State. She converted to Islam after we got married in 2001.’

On the challenges facing the Hausa community in Abia Danladi said “The sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) is affecting us; not only our people but everybody. We are good citizens so we do whatever they say we should do. We have lost so many things including lives but we believe the state government would do something about it.”

On migrant labourers he also said “If somebody is leaving his state he should have a contact in the place he is going to. If he is arrested he can say where he is going and who he is going to meet.”

‘We won’t go anywhere’

He is committed to Abia the state where he was born and does not anticipate relocating to the North.

His also said “We are not ready to go anywhere. This is our fatherland. Kano is just a name. I don’t spend more than five days there. All my life I have been here. My wife is from here and everybody is here. I only spent a week in Kano when I lost my mother.

“We are good people; we are not for violence. We want to live in peace with our host community. We want everybody to know that we are peaceful people.”

Sanusi Gwarzo the youth leader in the Hausa community Umuahia also said “We cannot go anywhere. I was born in Umuahia. I speak Igbo and Abia is my state. I hail from Kano too. One of my brothers married an Igbo girl from Imo State.”

Cattle market at Lokpanta

There is a cattle market at Umuchieze popularly known as Lokpanta which is actually the name of a nearby location. The area is made up of an undulating land. Its Jumat mosque sits on the highest point of the area and the rest of the community lies below this point. Here is a slope with shops of all sorts and dwellings on both sides of it. The main Enugu-Umuahia expressway can be seen as cars and other vehicles speed by either heading towards Umuahia or going to Enugu.

‘Many of us were born here’

A section of Umuchieze also extends across the expressway. Auwal Hamma is the secretary-general of the cattle market while its chairman is Alhaji Saleh Algare.

Hamma said “Many of us were born here in Abia; our parents too were born here. Some of us have Igbo mothers. We are Nigerians and have no other country to go to. We cannot leave here except somebody forces us out. We developed this place have intermarried and were born and brought up here. From time to time we visit the North and return. Anybody who wishes to go to the North is free to do so.”

Trekking from the North

The cattle market has a long history. In the past they trekked from the North to convey cattle to the East. The backbone of the cattle market include Kanuri Fulani Hausa and Shuwa Arabs. He said there was a time members of the community resided in Abakaliki Enugu Okigwe and finally settled at Umuchieze.

No govt project

Hamma further said “We have been here since 2005 yet we are lacking many things. There is no government project. We cater for ourselves and have developed this place. This is the second biggest cattle market east of the Niger. In December we can offload not less than 150 trailers containing cattle. Majority of our cattle traders come all the way from Sokoto Kano Katsina. We are predominantly from the North East.”

Impact of sit-at-home

Hamma said the sit-at-home order had affected the cattle market explaining that Monday is the biggest market day so losing it is a big blow.

“Igbo merchants cattle dealers and butchers are also complaining. As the beginning of the week if you lose Monday you have lost everything. Even our host community has lost a lot. Their merchants usually came here on Mondays to buy cows but now they no longer come and it is affecting our business” he lamented.

On the challenges of insecurity he lamented over some herdsmen who lost their lives and cattle killed by unknown gunmen.

No water no school

Alhaji Mohammed Bulama the vice chairman of the Umuchieze cattle market said “Since the inception of the cattle market 17 years ago there has been no pipe borne water no hospital no school. And we have not less than 300 children of school age.

“There is no bank here so we go to Okigwe everyday to deposit money. If our wives have to deliver we take them to Okigwe in Imo State which is 25 kilometres away.”

He added that their cattle usually go to the bush to drink water even as they are not allowed to pasture at Umuchieze their host community. He called on the state government to look into the situation.

Hamma recalled that 200 hectares of land within Umichieze were given to the cattle market when it first opened in 2005 adding “It was a virgin land so we set up the cattle market and created space for accommodation and shops.”",,,,,,

The Navy did use the EPA’s new PFAS lifetime health advisory level and new screening standards to re-evaluate known and potential contamination on the Calverton site itself. It has reversed previous decisions to close out investigations of groundwater contamination at five “areas of concern” on the site and has also added a new “area of concern” for further investigation Navy officials told community residents at a virtual public hearing this week.

The meeting was the Navy’s first public meeting about cleanup efforts at Calverton since the EPA announcement in June.

Residents were unhappy to learn that the new EPA advisory level did not change the Navy’s stance with respect to off-site groundwater pollution south and southeast of the facility where homes without access to public water must rely on private wells. Testing detected PFAS in well water in the area in some instances at levels that exceeded New York State’s strict new drinking water standards but were lower than the EPA’s lifetime advisory level then in effect.

The EPA in June announced new lifetime advisory levels for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances known as PFAS because analyses of more recent health effects studies show that PFAS can impact human health at exposure levels far lower than the 70 parts per trillion lifetime health advisory level issued by the EPA in 2016. The agency reduced the lifetime health advisory level to 4 parts per quadrillion — a level so low it cannot even be detected.

There is still no federal drinking water standard for PFAS though the EPA said in June it expected to issue a proposed national drinking water regulation for PFAS this fall. The proposed regulation has not yet been released.

The Navy has said it is not responsible for remediating off-site groundwater pollution or even for conducting continued testing because PFAS has not been found at levels that exceed the 70 PPT lifetime health advisory the EPA has now abandoned. And it was clear at Wednesday night’s meeting that the Navy will not change its position despite the EPA’s drastic change in the lifetime health advisory level. MORE COVERAGE:

Fearing Grumman water contamination frustrated Manorville residents without access to public water ask Navy for relief Schumer demands Navy act quickly to bring public water to homes near the former Grumman site in Calverton A united community demands public water in area near former Grumman site — but Navy shows no sign of budging Riverhead officials meet with Navy reps to demand ‘swift action’ on funding for public water extensions to homes near former Grumman plant

“Private wells are below the 2016 EPA Lifetime Health Advisory so no additional drinking water sampling is currently planned” Navy project manager Addison Phoenix said Wednesday. That is Department of Defense policy at the present time Pheonix said.

The Navy is still working to identify and clean up environmental contamination at the Calverton facility which closed nearly 30 years ago. Last month the Navy finalized and released a Community Involvement Plan for the site that summarizes and explains the investigation and remediation process at Calverton. Read the Community Involvement Plan below.

The Navy’s focus remains soil and groundwater pollution at the facility itself where Grumman (later Northrop Grumman) manufactured and tested aircraft for the Navy from the 1950s until 1996. Though the Navy transferred most of the site to the Town of Riverhead Community Development Agency in 1998 it continues a tedious and slow investigation and remediation process at the site which will continue for at least several more years.

The process follows a framework spelled out in the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act a 1980 federal law known as CERCLA intended to address releases or potential releases of hazards substances into the environment including at former military installations such as the site in Calverton.

Navy personnel and its contracted remediation firms present progress reports twice a year at public meetings of the Calverton Restoration Advisory Board a citizens committee established in 1997 to receive updates about the cleanup from the Navy and express residents’ concerns about the process and the site. Wednesday’s meeting was the 56th meeting of the Calverton Restoration Advisory Board.

Residents criticize Navy policy using ‘outdated’ standard

As this laborious process continues local residents who believe groundwater pollution in their community emanated from the Navy installation continue to fight for a public water supply extension to serve their homes and continue to ask the Navy to help fund the cost of the extension. The Navy denies responsibility citing the EPA’s old advisory level.

Some advisory board members residents and officials voiced strong objections to the Navy’s stance as they have in the past.

“The 70 parts per trillion is really a number that is outdated” said advisory board member Adrienne Esposito a clean water advocate with Citizens Campaign for the Environment. “Science shows us that is completely a number that should not be used to protect public health. So I just want to go on record as saying that. I know you’re using it and I’m really concerned about why you would do that” Esposito said.

“We have an issue with that also” added Andrew Rapiejko of the Suffolk County Department of Health Services.

Phoenix said the state’s maximum contaminant level — currently 10 parts per trillion — applies to public water supplies not groundwater or private wells. The state MCL would factor into a feasibility study the Navy must complete later on in the process she said.

But the 70 PPT lifetime health advisory level was used for the off-base private drinking water wells “and that is currently the Navy policy” she said. “I know that’s not what you guys want to hear. We understand that. But that is currently the policy” she said.

“It still really doesn’t make much sense to me” Rapiejko replied.

“We’re talking about all the remediation that’s being taken on site” RAB member Catherine Karl said. “But there’s no talk about what remediation is being done for the residents where this plume is headed. So therefore where are we — where are the residents when it talks about acceptable risk levels? What’s the acceptable risk as far as the collateral damage for the residents of who’s getting sick of who’s drinking poisoned water? Where does that come in” she asked.

RAB member Kelly McClinchy of Manorville called the Navy’s policy of using the lifetime health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion when they are talking about groundwater off-site is “deceiving” and “dangerous for the public.”

“I want to make it clear for the record that groundwater is our drinking water” McClinchy said. “You can say it’s your policy. I understand. We’ve heard it over and over. But it is deceiving. And it’s dangerous for the public. They think everything’s fine when in fact everything is not fine” McClinchy said.

“And I don’t know why you have not informed anybody on these meetings that there are actually homes in this plume that you show. That’s just — that’s deceitful” McClinchy added.

“It is unfair to the residents to continue to use 70 parts per trillion for groundwater related to private drinking wells. We don’t have access to public water. We would love access to public water. There’s nothing we would love more than that” McClinchy said.

McClinchy and other residents of Manorville and Calverton south and southeast of the former military installation have for years been seeking an extension of the Riverhead Water District to serve their homes so far without success due to the cost of the project. The town has received commitments for federal funding to pay part of the cost but has come up short on state assistance needed to make the job feasible. The state has twice denied the town’s funding requests through a water infrastructure program. MORE COVERAGE: Residents call on governor state lawmakers to fund public water extension in Manorville

Riverhead Water District Superintendent Frank Mancini who is also a member of the RAB expressed his own frustration with a disconnect between the Navy’s site investigation and remediation process and community needs.

“It’s nice that we do this twice a year. But for the rest of the 363 days of the year where we interface with the public they’re scared they’re concerned they want action” Mancini said Wednesday.

“I see we’ve got some people from the [State Department of Environmental Conservation] DEC here. The DEC essentially owns the aquifer” Mancini said. “And they regulate it not the Town of Riverhead. So I’ve been recently trying to communicate to the public perhaps we will be more effective if we’re interacting directly with the DEC” Mancini said.

Esposito agreed. “The DEC really needs to step up” she said. “Because this is a policy that the Navy has that protects the Navy” she said. “And the DEC is supposed to have policies that protect the public.”

DEC Record Permitting Section Chief Lynn Winterberger an Albany official who attended the meeting said homes with private wells above the 10 PPT state drinking water standard are offered bottled water by the agency.

Manorville resident Toni Pawson said giving residents bottled water really doesn’t help. People can drink it and cook with it. “But we can’t shower with it. We can’t wash our clothes with it. So giving us bottled water does really actually nothing for us when we need to shower and we need to wash our clothe and we need to put our children in bathtubs” she said.

“Give us city water and the Navy should be chipping in and helping us out to get it” Pawson said.

Assembly Member Jodi Giglio asked the state DEC and health department representatives at the meeting to contact her office.

“How much money are we spending where it behooves us to connect these people to public water? How much money is the Navy spending where it begins to be nonsensical. Just connect the people to public water and continue the process” Giglio said.

“I mean we’re doing testing. Testing is expensive. These filtration systems on homes are expensive. The people do have contaminants in the water even if they’re under 10 parts per trillion” she said. “I want to know how much money we’ve spent since this has started with the Navy with remediating this property. Because I’m sure that we are far over the threshold of connecting these people to public water” Giglio said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTgvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvZGVmZW5zZS1jb250cmFjdG9ycy11a3JhaW5lLXJ1c3NpYS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Military Spending Surges Creating New Boom for Arms Makers (Published 2022),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTgvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvZGVmZW5zZS1jb250cmFjdG9ycy11a3JhaW5lLXJ1c3NpYS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D80B79000>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The port welcomed a total of 310767 passengers and 128 cruise ships this season according to a press release.

“We were thrilled to see that the demand for cruising continues to be strong as we work to support the recovery of travel and tourism in New England” said Massport port director Joseph Morris.

“Boston has grown as both a homeport and destination port of call for multiple cruise lines and we look forward to expanding our itineraries for customers in the future.”

A record number of homeport ships was reported this year with five vessels from four different cruise lines while the number of passengers and ships in October surpassed that of the same time frame in 2019.

The 2022 cruise season began in April and ended before Thanksgiving.

Massport welcomed 12 maiden voyages to Boston including Norwegian Cruise Lines’ Norwegian Pearl Holland America Line’s Nieuw Statendam Carnival Cruise Line’s Carnival Legend and both Enchanted Princess and Sky Princess from Princess Cruises.

Senior Vice President of Port Development and Construction of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Juan Kuryla said: “Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises congratulate Flynn Cruiseport Boston on a strong comeback year.

“The health of the cruise industry is critical for port communities as its contributions help stimulate the local economy and support infrastructure investments. Flynn Cruiseport Boston is the homeport for one of our most popular itineraries to Bermuda and we are excited to continue our strong partnership.”

Flynn Cruiseport also celebrated Celebrity Cruises’ inaugural homeport season in Boston with an event featuring their CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo and Massport CEO Lisa Wieland.

“Our first season homeporting in Boston was a great success and we can’t wait to build on it for the 2023 season” said Lisa Lutoff-Perlo.

“As a native of the Boston area I’m thrilled to see the region thrive and congratulate all of the teams within the Massachusetts Port Authority on a truly stellar year.”

The 2023 cruise season set to begin on March 31 with the Norwegian Pearl sailing to Bermuda is expected to be as successful as 2022",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL3dlZWtseS1jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy11cGRhdGUtZGVjZW1iZXItMTctMjAyMi85MDY3NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weekly Cruise News Update: December 17 2022,"Plenty of cruise news to catch up on from the past week including coverage from Carnival Norwegian Cruise Line Holland America and Royal Caribbean. It has been a week full of cancellations cutbacks and program changes which Cruise Hive will update you on.

It’s time to ensure you’re caught up on the latest cruise news across the major cruise lines. This past week we’ve got coverage on cruise cancellations for three Carnival cruise ships Royal Caribbean making adjustments for loyalty passengers Holland America joining in on the latest trend of increasing gratuities Carnival expanding on its offerings out of Virginia and Norwegian Cruise Line making a difficult decision to cut 9% of its shoreside staff.

Carnival Cruise Line Cancellations

It has been a busy week of Carnival Cruise Line cancellations for a total of three ships impacting cruises as far as 2024. We start with the Carnival Vista cruise ship with the cruise line canceling all sailings from January 7 2024 departure through the February 10 2024 cruise.

In total five sailings have been impacted and guests and travel partners have been contacted via email about their options. During the time frame of the canceled cruises Carnival Vista will instead be undergoing a dry dock. The details of the dry dock have not been revealed but the process is likely to include a variety of upgrades and maintenance that is not practical to do while guests are onboard.

Carnival Cruise Line has also canceled a month of sailings for Carnival Sunrise as well as several cruises canceled for Carnival Miracle.

Carnival Sunrise has now been scheduled for an extended dry dock in early 2024 and impacted guests and travel advisors are being contacted about the canceled sailings which include all voyages from February 1 through and including March 4 2024.

Carnival Cruise Line brand ambassador John Heald addressed the cancelations including Carnival Vista‘s canceled cruises on his Facebook page.

“Dry dock planning is done in advance but sometimes we do have to change plans and so some of you have had your cruises canceled for 2024 on these two ships” Heald said.

In addition to the cruise cancelations for Carnival Vista and Carnival Sunrise the Spirit-class Carnival Miracle has also canceled cruises but for a different reason. Carnival Cruise Line has rescheduled Carnival Miracle for a 14-night “Carnival Journeys” sailing to Hawaii departing on Sunday January 21 2024.

This means the ship’s previously scheduled cruises must be canceled to accommodate the new sailing. The new Hawaii cruise will still depart from Carnival Miracle‘s homeport Long Beach California.

The canceled sailings are from January 21 2024 through and including January 30 2024 after which the ship will resume its previously planned Baja Mexico and Mexican Riviera itineraries with another Carnival Journeys cruise to Hawaii departing on February 17 2024.

Guests impacted by the cancelations for any of the three vessels have several options for compensation. Though the now-canceled sailings are more than a year away many travelers plan cruises well in advance and will now need to adjust their plans.

Holland America Line Increases Service Charges

Holland America Line part of Carnival Corporation & plc has announced a slight increase in gratuity rates to take effect on all sailings from February 1 2023. The increase will be $.50 (USD) per guest per day in all stateroom categories.

The new rate will then be $17.50 per person per day for guests in suites and $16.00 per person per day in non-suite stateroom categories such as balcony oceanview and interior staterooms.

Holland America Line describes these fees as “a daily amount for each guest that will be automatically added to your onboard account for your convenience to recognize the efforts of a wide variety of crewmembers who contribute to the experiences of all our guests.”

Holland America Line has not clarified whether or not guests booked on sailings after February 1 2023 can still pre-pay gratuities before that date to take advantage of the lower rate which remains at $17 per person per day for suites and $15.50 per person per day for non-suites through January 31.

The announcement from Holland America Line follows a similar increase from Princess Cruises which is raising gratuity rates by $1.50 per person per day for all cabin and suite categories effective on Wednesday December 14 2022.

Royal Caribbean Loyalty Benefit Changes

The Miami-based cruise line has informed guests about some loyalty benefit changes over the past week including vouchers and a specific onboard venue.

We start with letting you know that Royal Caribbean is removing Concierge Lounge access from Diamond Plus benefits. This change will be implemented for all voyages departing on or after December 16 2022 for all ships in the Royal Caribbean fleet.

Previously specific lounge access has been variable depending on the overall guest count onboard individual ships and on individual sailings depending on how many guests have met specific loyalty benefit levels.

Now lounge access will be fully standardized and only Pinnacle level guests (700+ cruise points) as well as suite guests will be authorized to enjoy the space.

This change only applies to ships that do not have a Suite Lounge which includes all Radiance-class ships all Vision-class ships the Voyager-class Explorer of the Seas and the three oldest Quantum-class vessels Quantum of the Seas Anthem of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas.

Royal Caribbean guests who have reached the Diamond Diamond Plus or Pinnacle level of the cruise line’s Crown and Anchor loyalty program have long enjoyed daily drink vouchers as a special perk for their loyalty.

A problem however is that the time to reset the voucher use window has always been midnight. This means that vouchers redeemed after midnight would count toward the following day’s total though many guests consider a late night of karaoke comedy or hanging out past midnight to be technically part of the previous day.

Now Royal Caribbean has shifted that time to 5:00 a.m. which permits guests to use each day’s drink vouchers anytime from 5 a.m. in the very early morning to 4:59 a.m. the following very late night.

“We want to make sure you’re getting the most out of this benefit!” Royal Caribbean explained in a letter to loyal guests. “Your daily complimentary vouchers will now reset at 5:00 AM every morning allowing you to get more out of this benefit during prime hours of each day including your after-midnight drinks.”

This change takes effect for all sailings departing on or after Friday December 16 2022. It should be noted however that the overall number of drink vouchers each guest receives is not changing.

Carnival Sunshine Norfolk Cruises

Carnival Cruise Line announced on Thursday December 15 2022 that they will be expanding operations from Norfolk with Carnival Sunshine to be homeported from the Old Dominion state beginning in mid-February 2025. While only two months of sailings in 2025 are currently planned the cruise line continues to work on scheduling for the future.

“As we work closely with city and port officials on our plans to increase from seasonal to year-round operations we’re delighted to open these sailings for sale so guests from all over the southeastern U.S. can start doing some planning of their own for 2025” said Christine Duffy president of Carnival Cruise Line.

Carnival Sunshine will offer a variety of 6-8 night sailings with two different itineraries of each length. Depending on departure date the 6-night cruises will visit either Bimini or Half Moon Cay and both itinerary options will stop in Nassau.

The 8-night sailings will both go to Amber Cove and Grand Turk and depending on the departure date will also visit either Princess Cays or Half Moon Cay. Currently Carnival Sunshine is homeported from Charleston South Carolina through the end of 2024.

Norwegian Shoreside Staff Cuts

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings announced in the past week that it would be cutting back on its shoreside staff. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings said the decision to reduce shoreside staff by 9% is one of the company’s “prudent actions across our business to align with our strategic priorities.”

A statement from the company said “After careful consideration we have made the difficult decision to restructure and rightsize our shoreside workforce reducing our current and planned shoreside roles by approximately 9%. This action is part of a broader and ongoing effort to improve operating efficiencies including cost minimization initiatives to strengthen the foundation for sustained profitable growth.”

Details regarding how the workforce reduction would affect the operations of the company’s three brands were not provided. Norwegian Cruise Line is a mainstream line catering largely to families. Oceania Cruises is an upmarket line and Regent is one of the top luxury lines operating today.

The planned cuts in shoreside staffing come on the heels of fee and gratuity increases the company has announced in recent weeks. Guests onboard Norwegian Cruise Line ships are now being charged a new $4.95 service fee for continental breakfast room service.

Shield TV products officially advertised as “Streaming Media Player” will soon lose one of its core functionality NVIDIA announced.

NVIDIA Shield TV and Shield TV Pro are among the most popular Android Set-Top boxes but also one of the most expensive ones. Those devices are based on powerful Tegra X1+ with built-in 256-core GPU. This means compelling hardware to play Android games on the device itself but also enough power to stream any type of media from cloud and local services.

The support for local game streaming called GameStream will soon be removed though. NVIDIA announced that starting mid-February an update to ‘NVIDIA Games’ app will remove the functionality to stream games from local PCs. This service utilizes the power of GeForce GTX/RTX GPUs to stream games to the Shield TV products at high quality (4K 60FPS) and low latency even wirelessly.

Owners of Shield TV products have just started receiving emails informing them of GameStream End of Service. NVIDIA recommends to use Steam Link of GeForce Now instead but this means either using Steam app exclusively or paying for cloud-based service to receive similar stream quality.

GameStream End of Service Notification Source: NVIDIA

NVIDIA is still selling Shield TV boxes and advertising the GameStream service as supported although it will be removed in less than 2 months:

GameStream End of Service Notification Source: NVIDIA

The GameStream service was a great addition to a relatively niche product such as Shield. Redditors recommend switching to Moonlight or Sunshine alternatives but it is not clear how the removal of GameStream will affect those projects.

It is worth noting that at the same time NVIDIA is removing the local streaming service from their software AMD is expanding the support for AMD Link streaming service with AV1 RX7900 encoding and even 4-player support on one gaming PC.

In a closely split vote the board turned down the controversial proposal which drew passionate appeals from supporters and opponents.

The deal – called a Chapter 313 agreement – would have given Netherlands-based NXP a break on school district taxes over 10 years for one of its proposed expansion projects in Austin.

Board President Arati Singh and Trustees Lynn Boswell Kevin Foster and David Kauffman voted for the proposal while Trustees Candace Hunter Andrew Gonzales Noelita Lugo Kathryn Whitley Chu and Ofelia Zapata voted against it.

Under the state-created Chapter 313 program the district would cap the taxable value on the company’s improved property. The company would instead pay the district a fee and the state would make up any revenue the district lost through the agreement.

The deal would have meant cost savings for NXP and an inflow of $63.5 million in revenues for the district that wouldn't have been subject to the state’s recapture program. The Austin district loses $846 million from its coffers each year to the recapture program.

The state program has long been a point of woe among Austin school officials. The program funnels tax revenue from property-rich districts like Austin to property-poor districts under the idea that every district gets the same amount of money per student.

NXP's Chapter 313 proposal had received support from the Austin business community but opposition from others.

About 25 members of Central Texas Interfaith a group of nonprofits that advocates for various community interests packed into the board room to oppose the deal.

Interfaith members worried that providing the tax break will ultimately rob the larger state school fund and will mean districts lose leverage in advocating for more state-provided education funding.

“Chapter 313 is a failed program” said the Rev. Jose Guerrero with St. Ignatius Martyr Catholic Church. “The math doesn’t add up. This is not a good investment.”

The Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce had thrown its support behind the proposal noting it would facilitate bringing jobs to the area.

NXP had proposed a $2.6 billion project to expand a 520000-square-foot fabrication plant and 47000-square-foot central plant at 3501 and 2949 Ed Bluestein Blvd. respectively alongside existing chip fabrication plants according to the application. It would have created 350 jobs with a $68500 minimum salary according to the application.

Split decision

Zapata didn’t feel it was right to give a company tax breaks when so many families in the district have their own financial struggles.

“They are working families who pay their taxes” Zapata said. “In fact they just voted overwhelmingly to pass our bond.”

Foster however worried the district was leaving money on the table by rejecting the deal.

“Educating the diverse range of students we have costs more money” Foster said. “We pay our fair share to the state.”

Kauffman who voted for the proposal said he didn't think school districts are the right venue for this kind of agreement but until Dec. 31 this tool is available to districts he said.

“I am convinced that the extra funds generated from this agreement would benefit AISD” Kauffman said. “I am convinced that Austin benefits from our technology industry. I am convinced that given the flawed education funding system in Texas this agreement will not harm students in other districts.”

In the past districts have generally approved these agreements because they provide money to districts that isn't subject to recapture said Nathan Jensen a University of Texas government professor.

However districts should know that these projects could fall through and that they shouldn’t count on this money he said.

“I really worry about school districts that are banking on this 313 money” Jensen said. “I would not trust this at all.”

Whether or not the Austin board would even get an opportunity to vote on the proposal was uncertain.

With the imminent expiration of the Chapter 313 program at the end of the year a flood of applications barraged the Texas State Comptroller’s Office. Any application needs the office’s sign-off before interested districts can approve an agreement.

The comptroller’s office approved the larger of the two NXP-proposed projects in November.

With the pending expiration date a slew of companies applied for potential and future projects Jensen said.

“From 2001 to 2016 there were 300-some projects total” Jensen said. “Just in the last six months there's 500 projects. Companies are locking in future projects.”

Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar issued a Wednesday night news release insisting his office had done everything it could to process applications despite pushback from businesses.

“My office had the difficult task of managing a workload that has more than tripled in the last six months of the year” Hegar said. “We have taken measures to responsibly allocate the necessary resources to comply with the law.”

Hegar’s statement came in response to a writ of mandamus filed by multiple companies asking the Texas Supreme Court to compel his office to process all Chapter 313 applications.

Hegar called the action “frivolous.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

When members of Old Dominion University’s fall Class of 2022 entered Chartway Arena on Saturday they probably weren’t aware they had a little Kobe Bryant in them.

Jay Harris the featured speaker at the University’s 137th Commencement Exercises assured them that they did.

Harris an ESPN SportsCenter anchor and an ODU alum related a story about Bryant missing jump shots he usually makes during a pregame warmup. Bryant was sure something was wrong with the basket. He knew it was too low – by a quarter of an inch. He called maintenance staffers over to check. Sure enough he was right.

“Now you might be saying ‘Hey Jay nice story but why’d you tell it? What does the late great Hall of Fame legend five-time NBA champion Kobe ‘Bean’ Bryant have to do with me?' Everything” Harris said. “Because he is you.”

Harris explained what he meant.

“See the only way you know a rim is a quarter of an inch too low is because you put up enough shots to know exactly how much force and arc you need on the basketball court to make a bucket from different spots on the court” Harris continued. “You know the rim is a quarter of an inch too low because you put in the work. Like you have. You've focused. Like you have. You're driven like you are. Even if you needed a little extra help or extra incentive or extra time or extra focus or extra work. You are here. Today. Ready. And you even navigated a pandemic along the way. I mean really. You were ready for a whole new world doing all new things. There is something in you that Monarch DNA I like to call it that got you to this point in time. It got you to this place.”

“You’re stepping forward today. And I need you to keep stepping tomorrow. And the day after that and the day after that.” - Jay Harris

Nearly 2000 undergraduate and graduate students received degrees in two ceremonies. The first at 9 a.m. celebrated graduates of the Darden College of Education and Professional Studies Batten College of Engineering and Technology College of Sciences and the School of Cybersecurity. The 12:30 p.m. event recognized the newest alumni of the College of Arts and Letters Strome College of Business College of Health Sciences and the Graduate School.

“Your time at ODU developed your ability to listen with a critical ear and think with an open mind” said President Brian O. Hemphill Ph.D. “This institution has prepared you for a life of service: not only to self and family but to those in need. I am confident you will take your Monarch values with you on the journey ahead.”

Harris who earned a bachelor’s degree in speech communication in 1987 and served two four-year terms on the Board of Visitors was presented with a Doctor of Humane Letters (honoris causa) from President Hemphill and Rector Bruce Bradley.

“You are officially a double alumnus of Old Dominion University” President Hemphill said.

“I’m Dr. Jay!” Harris quipped.

In his introductory remarks Athletic Director Wood Selig noted that “Hampton Roads and Old Dominion University have Jay’s heart.”

“While ODU is well-represented in the professional sports ranks with three-time Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Justin Verlander and Washington Commanders starting quarterback Taylor Heinicke leading the way no ODU alum packs more of a day-to-day presence and punch than our very own Jay Harris” he added.

Harris gave a warm shoutout and shared an embrace on the stage with his lifelong friend Ricardo Cortez Randall who received his Ph.D. in educational leadership. He told the graduates that each of their journeys will be unique.

“Many of my friends and classmates walked off this campus straight into careers and got paid. I didn’t” he said noting that it took him a year and half to land his first media job – working for free to start. “My path was my path. Your path will be your path. The person next to you will have their path. Whatever your path just keep going. Follow your passion your dreams your talents and your desires. Even when you hear the word no.”

He said the noes he heard early on paved the way for the yesses that came later. He urged them to draw on the poem “Invictus” when things get tough and to keep three “rules” in mind as they chart their futures:

“Rule No. 1: If you do not go after what you want you will never have it. Rule No. 2: If you do not ask the answer will always be no. Rule No. 3: If you do not step forward you will always be in the same place.”

“You’re stepping forward today” he added. “And I need you to keep stepping tomorrow. And the day after that and the day after that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYW1lcmljYW5zb25nd3JpdGVyLmNvbS80LXNvbmdzLXlvdS1kaWRudC1rbm93LW9sZC1kb21pbmlvbnMtbWF0dGhldy1yYW1zZXktd3JvdGUtZm9yLW90aGVyLWFydGlzdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Songs You Didn't Know Old Dominion's Matthew Ramsey Wrote For Other Artists,"Matthew Ramsey has amassed his fair share of hits as the frontman of Old Dominion—”One Man Band” “No Hard Feelings” and “Hotel Key” to name a few. But his first few years in Nashville saw him penning hits for other artists with the same vulnerability ear-worm hooks and sly lyrics you find in his own offerings.

Videos by American Songwriter

Among the artists that have cut Ramsey’s tunes are The Band Perry Craig Morgan Kenny Chesney and Dierks Bentley. Check out which songs Ramsey wrote for these artists below.

1. “Chainsaw” (The Band Perry)

Written by Matthew Ramsey Shane McAnnally and Josh Osborne

Perry originally wrote “Chainsaw” for Old Dominion. Ultimately it went to The Band Perry in 2014 for their sophomore album Pioneer. The lyrics center around a woman scorned who destroys a tree in which she and her former lover carved their initials. The track earned them the No. 10 spot on the Billboard Country Airplay Chart.

We scratched our names

In that oak tree

‘Cause I loved you

And you loved me

A jagged little heart so the whole town knew it

Carved in the bark with an arrow through it

Well I came out here to see it one more time

And I got my chainsaw

Oh you know it’s got to go it’s such a shame y’all

But I ain’t gonna be happy ’til those names fall

And I’m sittin’ on a stump

2. “Wake Up Lovin’ You” (Craig Morgan)

Written by Matthew Ramsey Trevor Rosen and Josh Osborne

Before Old Dominion released their own version of “Wake Up Lovin’ You” Craig Morgan got hold of the track in 2013. Morgan said at the time “I really believe that this will be the song of my career because it’s a turning point.” It broke the Top 20 on the Billboard Country Airplay Charts. Ramsey and the rest of Old Dominion went on to record their own version of the track.

My friends call me up ’cause they know I’m down

Take me out to paint the town and help me get over it.

A pretty blonde girl at the end of the bar

Buys a drink gives a wink and then it goes too far.

We’re out on the dance floor feelin’ the gin

I finally start comin’ alive again

I take her home for the night and everything is right

Until the first ray of sunlight

And damn if I don’t wake up lovin’ you

Oh I wake up lovin’ you

3. “Say You Do” (Dierks Bentley)

Written by Matthew Ramsey Shane McAnally and Trevor Rosen

Dierks Bentley recorded this Ramsey-penned track in 2014 for his album Riser. Bentley said he loved the track “right from the beginning. It’s about wanting something so badly even if it’s not good for you just wanting that love back which is something I think everyone can relate to at some point in their life” he once said. The track peaked at No. 1 on the Country Airplay Charts.

Well couldn’t you

Say you do

Say you might

For tonight

Have a heart

Bend the truth even if you don’t

Couldn’t you mess me up get in my head

Steal my T-shirt

Wreck my bed all night long like you used to

Even if you don’t couldn’t you say you do

4. “Save It For a Rainy Day” (Kenny Chesney)

Written by Matthew Ramsey Brad Tursi and Andrew Dorff

Yet another Country Airplay No. 1 penned by Ramsey “Save It For a Rainy Day” appeared on Kenny Chesney’s 2015 album The Big Revival. The lyrics see Chesney push away his negative emotions saving them for a not-so-sunny day. It’s blithe country perfection.

It’s no secret that lately there ain’t no escape

And that I’ve been waking up alone

Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling

That you ain’t ever coming home

But today the tears ain’t gonna hit the floor

Cause the boat’s in the bay and it’s calling my name

So I’m heading on out the door

‘Cause the sun’s too bright the sky’s too blue

Beer’s too cold to be thinking bout you

Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away

Save it for a rainy day

Campaign understands OMD beat the incumbent Dentsu in a final shoot-out with Stagwell and WPP’s Wavemaker in contention earlier in a review process. The consultancy ID Comms helped facilitate the process.

Burberry initially launched a global review at the start of 2020 but placed it on hold as the coronavirus pandemic spread. The process restarted in the summer and OMD will take over the account in 2023.

OMD is this year’s Media Week Awards Agency of the Year. It won the British Gas media account in August and is locked in a battle for one of its longest-standing clients EasyJet.

Next year OMD will provide strategic media support to a fashion brand that has recently won plaudits for advertising. Burberry and Megaforce (the directing quartet from production company Riff Raff Films) picked up a Gold Lion for Film Craft for its ""Open spaces"" campaign at this year's Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity.

Burberry also has a new leader and strategic direction appointing former Gianni Versace chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd to lead the business and chief creative officer Daniel Lee (formerly of Bottega Veneta) to drive its creative vision.

According to a report in Vogue Akeroyd plans to double Burberry’s revenues to £5bn in the long-term by growing accessories to more than 50% of sales and developing its womenswear. He has also promised to amp up the brand’s ‘Britishness’.

In FY 2021/22 Burberry reported sales of £2.8bn including £210m in the UK where the business is headquartered. Its largest markets are Mainland China (with sales of £765 million) and the US (£408 million).

In its most recent annual report Burberry stated it would focus on “inspiring and exciting our customers through product-led content emotive campaigns and brand activations rooted in our heritage and history of adventure and exploration”.

The report added: “We are further integrating digital and physical journeys by expanding our omnichannel capabilities enabling more services from our stores.”

Dentsu has worked with Burberry since 2013. A spokesperson told Campaign: “Dentsu has worked with Burberry for the last decade during which time it has driven innovation into its media explored new channels for the brand and run numerous award-winning campaigns.

""After such a long and successful relationship we wish the team well for the future and will work closely with them to ensure a smooth transition.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjIvMTIvZmFucy1jaGFuZ2UtbmV3LWRpc25leS1zdWJzY3JpcHRpb24tZWExL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fans Demand Change to New Disney+ Subscription Tier,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjIvMTIvZmFucy1jaGFuZ2UtbmV3LWRpc25leS1zdWJzY3JpcHRpb24tZWExL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024DFDC3CD30>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The university’s president Hisao Ogawa is second from left. (Nami Sugiura)

KUMAMOTO--Kumamoto University announced it will offer courses specializing in semiconductors to help restore Japan’s former reputation as a powerhouse in the field.

The university said it will establish new divisions in April 2024 to nurture talent in an industry that is now dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) the global leader.

The Taiwanese company is now building a semiconductor factory in Kumamoto Prefecture.

“It is a once-in-a-century chance to establish a hub for semiconductor companies” the university’s president Hisao Ogawa told a Nov. 30 news conference. “We plan to make use of this opportunity to contribute to chip development at an early stage.”

It is the first time for the university to establish a new division equivalent to a faculty since it was founded in 1949.

The division tentatively called the School of Informatics will have an enrollment capacity of 60.

Students will learn data science focusing on data analysis.

Lectures will be given by instructors from humanities and science courses.

Twenty students will be accepted for the Data Science Semiconductor course while the Data Science General course will have a capacity of 40.

The primary purpose of the Data Science Semiconductor course is to provide training in production efficiency and quality control of semiconductors and related products.

The Data Science General course is aimed at preparing students to make use of data in other fields such as economic policy and health care.

A new program specializing in semiconductor devices which will be equivalent to a department and become part of the Faculty of Engineering is expected to have an enrollment capacity of 20. It is intended to train students in the production and development of semiconductors.

Each year around 70 students pursue a career in the semiconductor industry after graduating from Kumamoto University.

The university aims to double that figure in 10 years.

The school said it opted not to refer to the new divisions as faculties or departments because the courses will span various fields of learning."

They argue that since the company’s parent is Chinese-owned ByteDance the Chinese government effectively controls the platform and the data on it. Undoubtedly Chinese government interference is a potential risk for any Chinese company. But rather than pursuing blanket bans based on where a company is domiciled—an idea that could hurt U.S. tech companies in the global market if others adopted similar policies—policymakers should instead take concrete steps to better protect users and address data concerns.

Even before this week’s proposed legislative ban on TikTok a number of policymakers have taken aim at the social network. FBI Director Christopher Wray testified at a House Homeland Security hearing that the app creates “national security concerns.” Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-CA) recently voiced concerns about the ability of “hostile powers to potentially control social media networks.” And former president Donald Trump notably signed an executive order that would have effectively banned TikTok near the end of his term in office an order that President Biden eventually rescinded and replaced with a narrower and ongoing national security review.

TikTok has rapidly become one of the most popular apps in the United States with over 86 million users. The app is owned by parent company ByteDance a company based in China and TikTok itself has acknowledged in a letter to Congress this year that under certain circumstances employees in China have accessed data about American users in the past. Chinese law states that companies must give the Chinese government access to their data in the case of national security concerns and the public interest. Policymakers worry that this type of data sharing with the Chinese government puts U.S. national security interests at risk and could allow the Chinese government unfettered access to Americans’ personal data on TikTok. Some policymakers contend that this poses a particular threat to children’s data but have yet to clarify what they believe the Chinese government is actually doing with this data. In addition many worry that ByteDance in response to the Chinese government could influence the content that appears for TikTok users.

But each of these underlying concerns about TikTok can be better addressed through targeted policies rather than banning the app.

First to address the concern that TikTok will secretly send data about Americans back to China Congress should pass federal data privacy legislation that explicitly requires companies to disclose all data sharing and hold them accountable for the accuracy of those disclosures. For example the American Data Privacy and Protection Act would require companies to disclose whether they transfer store or process data in China Russia Iran or North Korea. This law would not prevent companies from sending data to China but it would ensure they would have to disclose this information publicly. And TikTok’s U.S.-based personnel would be legally responsible for knowingly making any false claims.

Second to address concerns about government requests for consumer data or attempts by governments to manipulate or censor content Congress should create mandatory transparency requirements so that social media companies must regularly produce transparency reports documenting any such requests. Here again the goal would be to eliminate any doubt about what demands governments might be making of companies. Regular reporting would ensure that governments’ requests cannot go undetected.

Finally to address concerns about access to sensitive consumer data policymakers should encourage more social media platforms to adopt end-to-end encryption for direct messages between users. Using end-to-end encryption would eliminate the risk that a third party including the platform itself could access private messages and would help keep consumer data out of the hands of bad actors.

Nevertheless some policymakers seem bent on enacting some kind of action before the end of this congressional term. On Wednesday the Senate passed a measure banning TikTok from being downloaded on any federal device. The legislation first introduced by Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) aligns with a myriad of states that have taken similar action. But targeting one specific application will do little to improve national security across the board. Rather than targeting TikTok policymakers should create a list of apps banned on federal devices with transparent and objective criteria.

Banning an app on the basis of its foreign ownership sets a bad precedent for the United States. Other countries could use it to justify their own bans on U.S. apps and online services under the guise of similar privacy and national security concerns. The result would be a loss of global market share for American companies and fragment Internet services hurting both businesses and consumers.

Moreover it would be premature for Congress to enact a ban on TikTok given that the Biden administration has been actively working with the company to address some of the main concerns relating to the app’s data practices and address national security issues. In a reversal of an August 2020 executive order effectively banning TikTok signed by Donald Trump the Biden administration has sought to take a more nuanced approach to evaluating the threat posed by not only TikTok but all social media platforms. At present the administration aims to keep TikTok operating in the United States without changing its ownership structure but is negotiating to require the company to route U.S. traffic through the U.S. cloud computing company Oracle and allow Oracle to audit TikTok’s algorithms and content moderation models.

Instead of stepping on the ongoing negotiations by the administration Congress should focus on prioritizing legislation that targets the underlying concerns which are not unique to TikTok. If Congress wants to take a hard line against China there are plenty of more pressing economic and security issues than TikTok that it could focus on. And if policymakers want to get serious about improving privacy and security they should take real steps to protect Americans online rather than impose bans that will hurt American businesses and consumers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy56YXd5YS5jb20vZW4vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS9jb21wYW5pZXMtbmV3cy90aGUtY2hhbXBpb24taG9zcGl0YWwtc2lnbnMtd2l0aC1vcmFjbGUtY2VybmVyLXRvLWRlbGl2ZXItYW4taW50ZWdyYXRlZC1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXN5c3RlbS1jeWkyaG02cNIBngFodHRwczovL3d3dy56YXd5YS5jb20vZW4vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS9jb21wYW5pZXMtbmV3cy90aGUtY2hhbXBpb24taG9zcGl0YWwtc2lnbnMtd2l0aC1vcmFjbGUtY2VybmVyLXRvLWRlbGl2ZXItYW4taW50ZWdyYXRlZC1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXN5c3RlbS1jeWkyaG02cD9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Champion Hospital signs with Oracle Cerner to deliver an integrated healthcare system,"The Champion Hospital the first general and rehabilitation private hospital in Kuwait has selected Oracle Cerner to implement an integrated electronic health record (EHR) platform across its full care facilities.

In February 2020 as Disney's head of streaming Kevin Mayer was in the line of succession for CEO. But Mayer seen here on Sept. 29 2022 and colleagues were stunned when Iger announced Bob Chapek would replace Iger immediately. Bryan van der Beek | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Still Iger said during a Disney town hall last month he isn't focused on M&A for the time being. Candle Media has acquired intellectual property assets including Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine production company and Moonbug which owns the animated kids series ""CoComelon."" Iger's calling card as CEO is acquiring IP including Pixar LucasFilm and Marvel. ""CoComelon"" could fit well within Disney+. But choosing Mayer or Staggs would also imply Iger made an error in judgment the first time. Executive 3: Iger extends his contract There's been lots of speculation over who Iger will choose as his successor. History suggests he has a hard time leaving the role of Disney CEO. So perhaps the most obvious answer as to who he will pick is: no one (at least not yet).

The retired Iger seen here on Dec. 6 2022 privately continued to talk with past and present Disney executives about Chapek and the company with several urging him to return to Disney according to people familiar with those conversations. David Dee Delgado | Reuters

This executive said Iger 71 will extend his contract beyond Dec. 31 2024 his current end date and stay as Disney CEO for years to come. Executive 4: Disney CFO Christine McCarthy will leave McCarthy has become the talk of Hollywood in recent weeks after CNBC and other publications reported she went behind former Disney CEO Bob Chapek's back to the Disney board to give him an effective vote of no confidence leading to his ouster.

David Zaslav President and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery talks to the media as he arrives at the Sun Valley Resort for the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 05 2022 in Sun Valley Idaho. Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images

Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has spent the past year cutting costs to slim down the merged WarnerMedia-Discovery and service the company's nearly $50 billion in debt. Zaslav's cost cutting moves haven't yet convinced investors he's on the right track to returning the company to glory. Warner Bros. Discovery shares have fallen about 60% since the April merger. Existing investors will lose patience with Zaslav and the board and will demand changes said one executive. It's possible an activist will take a stake in the company but it's even more likely long-time shareholders will lose confidence in his strategy when it doesn't produce a notable valuation bump in 2023 the executive predicted. Executive 7: The cost of sports rights will peak Live sports rights have been the lifeblood of the legacy pay TV industry for decades. National Football League games continue to dominate ratings. College football and NBA playoff games frequently draw enormous live audiences compared to almost everything else on cable all year. But media companies are now focused on building their streaming businesses as replacements for traditional pay TV. Consumers buy these services a la carte meaning non-sports fans don't have to buy services that include sports. Limited audiences combined with a legacy media industry intent on focusing on profits and cost cutting could end the trend of live sports commanding big rights increases. The NBA will still command a big increase as legacy pay TV continues to exist — primarily supported by sports. Those rights will likely be renewed in 2023. But in five to seven years it's possible traditional TV will be totally eliminated. That will lead to an environment where there are fewer bidders for sports rights dropping the price for sports across the board said this executive. Perhaps the NFL remains an outlier due to its popularity said the executive. But every other sport's prospects look bleak said the person. Executive 8: Paramount Global will sell possibly for parts This is our first repeat from last year. ""I love Shari [Redstone] but ViacomCBS is not long for this world as it stands today"" said a media executive last year.

Press Release Abu Dhabi 14 December 2022: On the heels of the exciting launch of the Maatla 4×4 Light Protected Vehicle (LPV) Paramount Land Systems a subsidiary of Paramount the Abu Dhabi headquartered global aerospace and technology company has announced that 50% of the newly announced Maatla vehicle contracts have already been completed with deliveries underway to customer countries.

The new multi-role ‘Maatla’ (meaning ‘Power’ in Setswana) was launched at the African Aerospace and Defence Exhibition (AAD 2022) held in September. It was during the expo that Paramount announced the first Maatla contracts totalling 50 vehicles.

The Maatla and has been designed to address the increasing demand for lighter weight vehicles while offering advanced capabilities and reconfigurability in the field. Given immediate interest for the Maatla’s capabilities from various countries each with diverse requirements Paramount plans to manufacture and deploy new Maatla variants with a focus on conducting a range of missions such as Command and Control CBRN Detection Police and Ambulatory Reconnaissance and Recovery and Border Patrol.

Eric Ichikowitz Senior Vice-President of Paramount International stated that “The immediate reaction and global demand for our newly launched Maatla Light Protected Vehicle (LPV) in this highly competitive marketplace is a testament to our commitment to mission survivability and outstanding vehicle performance while addressing the requirements of our customers.

“For over two decades we have leveraged and championed ground-breaking innovations in armoured vehicle design and manufacture. The Maatla is a product of working closely with our customers to finding solutions to their unique challenges. In matter of a few months we have unveiled a new vehicle secured orders and now deliveries are in full swing to customers. This is a proud achievement and we are delighted to see the response to the experience we bring in offering Maatla to the world”.

The Maatla has been manufactured on a commercial vehicle chassis capable of addressing all types of terrain for its nine-crew personnel. The vehicle is fitted with a 2-speed transfer case and 3 differential locks which allows it to cross almost any obstacle in difficult territories. Its Smart Floor technology further enables its seating to be quickly removed and the vehicle to be configured for alternative mission requirements with day/night vision devices and extra sensors able to be fitted to provide 24/7 operability.

The Maatla provides as a minimum ballistic and blast protections to STANAG 4569 Level 1 and can protect against handguns and other small calibre ball rounds. The vehicle also offers underbelly protection against M26 hand grenades or a blast equivalent.

The Maatla can reach a road speed of up to 100 km/hr with a cruising range of up to 600 km when travelling at 80 km/hr and a fording depth of up to 750 mm without preparation. The vehicle can be operated in extreme environments with temperatures ranging from -10°C to + 55°C also without any preparation.

Deon Grobler CEO of Paramount Land Systems added that: “Our innovative techniques in manufacturing the Maatla Light Protected Vehicle (LPV) are driving the tempo of customer delivery which is mission critical in our view given the ever changing and asymmetrical environment which many countries and their armed forces find themselves in. We look forward to the continued roll-out of the multi-purpose Maatla and to the development of its mission specific variants to meet our customers evolutionary requirements”.

Yellowstone’s first prequel 1883 told the story of the first generation of Duttons who settled the family’s land in Montana. The series starred Tim McGraw and Faith Hill as James and Margaret Dutton the ancestors of Yellowstone’s fifth-generation rancher John Dutton (Kevin Costner).

Paramount has confirmed that fans will get more of 1883 in the near future but it won’t be a second season about the Dutton family. Instead the prequel will get its very own spinoff — 1883: The Bass Reeves Story.

The first chapter of ‘Yellowstone’ has officially ended

A Paramount rep has confirmed that 1883 starring McGraw and Hill is officially over. Per Yahoo! the rep said “the 1883 chapter has ended and the next installment is 1923.” The official Instagram account of 1883 was changed to the official account of the next prequel which will star Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren as the next generation of Duttons.

Back in May Yellowstone executive producer David C. Glasser told The Hollywood Reporter that “additional episodes” of 1883 had been ordered but he declined to call it a “season 2.” We now know the reason he was playing so coy. Fans will get more 1883 in the form of a spinoff called 1883: The Bass Reeves Story.

Everything we know about ‘1883: The Bass Reeves Story’

When the series was first announced last year it wasn’t tied to Yellowstone. But now it will be part of the Yellowstone-verse telling a different story from the same time period as 1883. It will take place in Arkansas and Oklahoma and dramatize the life of the first black U.S. Marshal west of the Mississippi — Bass Reeves (David Oyelowo).

It’s not been revealed whether or not these two storylines will collide with a possible cameo from McGraw and Hill — or their co-stars Isabel May (Elsa Dutton) Sam Elliot (Shea Brennan) and LaMonica Garrett (Thomas).

Bass Reeves was a real-life former slave and lawman who arrested more than 3000 criminals and killed 14 people in self-defense during his legendary career. He’s thought to be the inspiration for the Lone Ranger character.

Legend has it that Reeves was never injured during the numerous arrests he made dealing with dangerous criminals. He retired from law enforcement in 1909 and died a year later.

‘Yellowstone’ fans will see a familiar face in ‘1883: The Bass Reeves Story’

Just like 1883 The Bass Reeves Story will be a limited series. Filming is underway and there will be a total of six episodes with Taylor Sheridan directing the first two.

For six years Oyelowo tried to make a series about Reeves through his production company Yoruba Saxon. They have an overall deal with Paramount Global (formerly ViacomCBS) just like Sheridan. But it wasn’t until the Yellowstone creator got involved that the project got the green light.

The only actors who’ve been confirmed so far are Oyelowo and Yellowstone star Cole Hauser (Rip Wheeler). He recently revealed to Entertainment Tonight that he was “switching it up” and would appear in the prequel/spinoff.

1883 is now playing on Paramount+. A premiere date for The Bass Reeves Story has not yet been announced.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aW5nbmV3cy5jb20vaW4vZm9vdGJhbGwvbmV3cy93YXRjaC1maWZhLXdvcmxkLWN1cC0yMDIyLWluZGlhLWxpdmUtdHYtY2hhbm5lbC10ZWxlY2FzdC9hZmR0OWRnMXZhNHh3ZnJncnMycjBoMWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where to watch FIFA World Cup 2022 in India: Live TV channel telecasts streaming and app to follow every match,"The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar has already delivered some unmissable football.

The Oklahoma City Thunder will host the Memphis Grizzlies in a Saturday night showdown at Paycom Center.

Memphis has won three-straight contests against Oklahoma City dating back to March of last season. This includes both contests to this point in the 2022-23 campaign by a combined 32 points.

Can the Thunder get their first win of the season over the Grizzlies tonight?

Petre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports

ODDS:

The Thunder enter the day as 6.5-point underdogs to the Grizzlies and the total over/under is 231.5 points.

KEYS TO THE GAME:

Memphis is the league's leading team on the glass pulling down nearly 49 rebounds per contest. While the Thunder are also solid on the boards they are undersized and could be dominated in the paint tonight.

While a lot of the focus will be on Ja Morant entering this game Jaren Jackson Jr. is known for being a guy that thrives against this Oklahoma City roster. Those two could single-handedly make this game for the Thunder to win.

On the flip side Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has emerged as a premier scorer and will have the chance to outscore everyone on the Grizzlies tonight. He will need help from Josh Giddey and Lu Dort offensively to put up a fight.

Save your predictions burn your assumptions.

When Ja Morant and the Grizzlies best in the West and winners of seven straight came into Oklahoma City to play the Thunder losers of five straight and without guards Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey a blowout would have been the only reasonable prediction.

Of course that would assume the Grizzlies blowing out the Thunder. The opposite happened.

The Thunder (12-18) stunned the Grizzlies 115-109 Saturday night at Paycom Center.

The Thunder’s 21-point halftime lead was its largest of the season. That it came against the near full-strength Grizzlies was astonishing.

OKC led Memphis by as many as 24 points but the Grizzlies cut the deficit to single digits with four minutes left in the fourth quarter.

Thunder sharpshooter Isaiah Joe drilled a 3-pointer to quell the rally.

Joe a revelation for the Thunder after being waived by the 76ers scored a career-high 23 points. He shot 7-of-12 overall including 5-of-8 from 3-point range.

He did it in his first start with the Thunder and the third start of his three-year career.

“I prepared the same way had the same routine” Joe said. “The same thoughts went through my head before the game.”

Joe started alongside Lu Dort Jalen Williams Aleksej Pokusevski and Eugene Omoruyi — not exactly the side you’d pick to beat Morant Jaren Jackson Jr and Co.

Before the game Thunder locker room leader Kenrich Williams gave a speech to the team: “Whenever they call your number be ready to play” said Dort relaying the words.

Contributions from a player like Joe were emblematic of that.

“We knew we were gonna be down a couple of guys tonight” Joe said “so we just had to come together as a team.”

Ja Morant ejected

Lisa from Oklahoma City had as much impact on the game as anyone.

Lisa who declined to share her last name sat courtside wearing a Ja Morant T-shirt. The Morant superfan didn’t want to miss the Grizzlies’ stop in OKC.

Morant hounded by Dort got off to a slow start.

He was whistled for a technical in the second quarter for “use of profanity directed at an official” crew chief John Goble told a pool reporter after the game.

Then 11 seconds later Morant was assessed a second technical and was ejected. Official Ray Acosta whistled Morant for both technicals.

But Morant wasn’t talking to Acosta during what led to the second technical. Morant was talking to Lisa.

“I was just telling Ja ‘let’s go’” Lisa told The Oklahoman.

Morant was off to a 3-of-10 start and Lisa was trying to encourage him.

Morant turned to her.

“He was just like he can’t do much because (the refs) missed a call” Lisa said.

Morant might have used more colorful language Lisa suggested and Acosta overhearing Morant tossed the Grizzlies star.

Lisa said she felt awful. The last thing she wanted to do was be partly responsible for her favorite player getting ejected.

After Morant exited Morant’s dad walked up to Lisa and gave Lisa his cell phone. Ja Morant was on FaceTime and he wanted to talk to Lisa.

“It’s all good” Morant said when Lisa apologized.

Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins declined to address Morant’s ejection.

“I’ll keep that private” he said. “Thunder played great. We just didn’t make enough shots tonight.”

Goble in the pool report said Morant was assessed the second technical for “questioning the integrity of the officials.”

Asked if Morant’s second technical was a “result of conversation or actions” with fans Goble’s response was a simple “No.”

“I got my first tech for saying I got hit in my (expletive) face. Didn’t curse at him” Morant told the Associated Press. “Another situation where he’s in my conversation and I get another tech for talking with a fan. I feel like when these fans came here went online to buy these tickets they didn’t say Ray (Acosta) name to come watch.”

Lu Dort’s fast start

Lu Dort held his follow-through after splashing his second 3-pointer in the first five minutes of the game.

The Thunder guard was feeling it.

Dort scored 10 of the Thunder’s first 12 points. On a night when the Thunder was down its top-two scorers in Gilgeous-Alexander and Giddey somebody had to step up and score and Dort was that guy.

He finished with a team-high 24 points along with seven rebounds four assists and only one turnover.

Dort was an efficient 8-of-14 including 3-of-4 from 3-point range. He entered the night shooting 32% from 3-point range.

The Thunder shot 19-of-45 (42%) from 3-point range as a team — its most made threes in a game this season.

Memphis meanwhile shot a clanky 26.7% from deep.

Dillon Brooks led the Grizzlies with 32 points.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Josh Giddey out

You might remember the last time Gilgeous-Alexander and Giddey missed a December game against Memphis.

The Grizzlies pummeled the Thunder by an NBA-record 73 points.

This game was in Oklahoma City instead of Memphis but the reeling Thunder was playing on the second night of a back-to-back and the Grizzlies were surging having just crushed the Bucks by 41 points on Thursday night.

Thankfully for the Thunder history didn’t repeat.

Gilgeous-Alexander was out with a lower back contusion and Giddey was sidelined with a non-COVID illness.

It was the third missed game for Gilgeous-Alexander and fourth for Giddey.

Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said Gilgeous-Alexander’s injury is closer to day-to-day than long-term.

“He’s been dealing with it and playing through it for some time now” Daigneault said.

Now deep into the season Daigneault was asked if bumps and bruises are piling up.

“Maybe but I think everybody deals with it” he said. “We haven’t dealt with it to the extreme that other teams have to this point.

“In (Gilgeous-Alexander’s) particular case he did everything he could to try to play tonight. He woke up really sore got treatment and it went right up to the line but just isn’t gonna have it tonight.”

Darius Bazley (non-COVID illness) was also out as were Ousmane Dieng (right wrist fracture) and Jeremiah Robinson-Earl (right ankle sprain) — both of whom are dealing with longer-term injuries.

Thunder tip-ins

• Thunder guard Tre Mann who had 11 points and six rebounds will soon be assigned to the G League Oklahoma City Blue Daigneault said after the game. Mann shooting 29% from 3-point range has been stuck in a season-long sophomore slump.

• ""Looking forward to it” Mann said. “I'm ready to go with the Blue compete get better just grow. That's my mindset."" Mann said his focus will be on finding his rhythm on catch-and-shoots.

• Mann said the G League assignment wasn’t hard to accept: “Nah my mindset is to do whatever I’ve gotta do to be the best player I can be” he said. “That’s what we feel is best for me — me and the coaches. I understand it. I’m gonna go down there and get better.”

• Grizzlies guard Desmond Bane (right big toe sprain) was out.

• The Thunder was 0-3 on the second night of back-to-backs before Saturday.

• The Thunder will host the Grizzlies in the series finale on April 9 — the last day of the regular season. Memphis leads the season series 2-1.

• Daigneault said Lindy Waters III was “battling an injury” when Waters was on assignment with the G League Blue. Waters played Friday for the first time since Nov. 21. “His readiness was impressive” Daigneault said.

• Waters went 2-of-2 from 3-point range in the first quarter Saturday.

• Aaron Wiggins had 14 points seven rebounds and four assists off OKC’s bench.

• Thunder rookie Jalen Williams shot 0-of-8. His only point came from the free throw line.

• Daigneault was asked if he puts any equity into or even looks at the NBA’s last two-minute reports which is basically a report card for how the officials did in a close game. “I look at it just to see how they interpret the calls” Daigneault said. “But at the end of the day it doesn’t change anything either.”

• “I want to make sure if I’m critical of the officials I’m doing so in a way that’s credible and fair and respectful to them” Daigneault added. “I’m just not gonna come up there and barbarically yell and scream every time it doesn’t go our way.”

• Former Thunder center Steven Adams received a warm welcome from Thunder fans in pregame introductions. Morant also received loud cheers.

• Kenrich Williams was the Thunder’s first substitute of the night. Williams missed the last six games with a right knee sprain. He had 11 points eight rebounds and five assists.

• Jaylin Williams made his first-career 3-pointer to give the Thunder a 35-24 lead in the second quarter. A “woo pig sooie” chant broke out from a group of fans in section 111.

• There were five traveling violations in the first 18 minutes.

• Aleksej Pokusevski took a hit to the face in the third quarter and had to leave the game with bleeding around his left eye.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhdG5hdGlvbi5jb20vZ2FtZS1uZXdzL21pYW1pLWhlYXQtdXBkYXRlLXN0YXR1c2VzLW9mLW11bHRpcGxlLWtleS1wbGF5ZXJzLWZvci1zYXR1cmRheXMtY29udGVzdC12cy1zYW4tYW50b25pby1zcHVycy_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWF0bmF0aW9uLmNvbS9nYW1lLW5ld3MvbWlhbWktaGVhdC11cGRhdGUtc3RhdHVzZXMtb2YtbXVsdGlwbGUta2V5LXBsYXllcnMtZm9yLXNhdHVyZGF5cy1jb250ZXN0LXZzLXNhbi1hbnRvbmlvLXNwdXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miami Heat update statuses of multiple key players for Saturday’s contest vs. San Antonio Spurs,"The Miami Heat remain heavily impacted by the injury bug at the moment and some updates to key players were offered prior to the team’s game against the San Antonio Spurs.

At the moment it appears there is some good news and bad news for the Heat. Star big man Bam Adebayo looks to be back after missing the most recent game with a left ankle sprain. On the more negative side of things point guard Kyle Lowry has been listed as out with soreness in his left knee and Caleb Martin has been listed as doubtful with an ankle sprain of his own.

The Heat’s injury report heading into Saturday’s game against the Spurs made some news on Friday after every player on the team’s active roster was listed on the report.

Though there is no doubt that the Heat have dealt with their fair share of injuries so far this season it appears as though the move was also done as a bit of a tongue-in-cheek protest.

On Friday the franchise was fined for failing to correctly list players’ game availability statuses for its game on Wednesday against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Per NBA: “The Miami Heat has been fined $25000 for violating league injury reporting rules. The Heat failed to disclose an accurate game availability status for several players prior to its game vs. Oklahoma City on Dec. 14 at Paycom Center.” — Anthony Chiang (@Anthony_Chiang) December 16 2022

Even if the injury report was packed partially for show it does not change the fact that the Heat have dealt with major injury issues so far this season. Basically every key player on the roster has missed some time already in the campaign.

It’s a big reason why the Heat are just .500 on the season at 15-15.

The good news is that the Heat have won four of their last five games. They’ve got a great opportunity to pick up another win on Saturday over the 9-19 Spurs and get over .500 for the first time this season.

Though the Heat should already like their chances of getting a win on Saturday the return of Adebayo to the lineup is fantastic news.

The big man is arguably playing the best basketball of his career right now averaging 23.7 points 10.2 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game over his last 10 games. He’s scored 28 or more points in four different games during that stretch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aW5nbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvbmJhL25ld3MvamEtbW9yYW50LWZhbi1lamVjdGlvbi1ncml6emxpZXMtdnMtdGh1bmRlci9rcnZ3amxta3FmbmV2Ym1jaHB6MmI5aHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ja Morant FaceTimes with Grizzlies fan after bizarre ejection vs. Thunder,"Saturday night's game between the Grizzlies and Thunder may have marked the first time in NBA history that a player was ejected from a game for engaging in a friendly conversation with a fan.

Near the end of the first half of the Western Conference clash Memphis star Ja Morant could be seen talking to a fan while Oklahoma City forward Eugene Omoruyi was standing at the free throw line. As OKC was making a substitution referee Ray Acosta blew his whistle and hit Morant with his second technical foul. (He had earned his first for arguing a no-call.)

The All-Star point guard and his teammates were stunned by the ejection. They attempted to explain that Morant wasn't addressing a referee but Acosta wasn't going to change his decision.

Here is the moment Ja Morant was ejected from tonight's game. pic.twitter.com/eSm5xb0qvx — Bally Sports: Grizzlies (@GrizzOnBally) December 18 2022

SiriusXM radio host Gabe Ikard who was in attendance at the Paycom Center described the lead-up to the ejection:

Summary of the ejection:

-Memphis fans were encouraging him to get going. Basically said “we’re down 20 let’s get goin’.”

-Ja was talking to them and said “I’ll get goin’ but the refs need to give me a f***in’ whistle.” Ref heard it and he tossed him 🤣 — Gabe Ikard (@GabeIkard) December 18 2022

Morant gestured toward the fan as he walked off the floor seemingly ending the interaction — until he hopped on FaceTime to continue the conversation.

He called his father Tee from the locker room and Tee brought his phone over to the fan.

Lisa told The Oklahoman's Joe Mussatto that she felt awful about the situation but Morant made it clear that she didn't deserve any blame.

This is Lisa a Ja Morant superfan who lives in OKC. She was at the center of the interaction that got Ja Morant ejected.

Lisa told Ja how awful she felt. Ja not at all upset with her said “it’s all good.” — Joe Mussatto (@joe_mussatto) December 18 2022

Morant finished with six points five rebounds and two assists in the Grizzlies' 115-109 loss.

During his postgame media availability Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins declined to comment on the officiating crew's explanation for the ejection. Crew chief John Goble told Mussatto that Morant was assessed the second technical foul for ""making a comment questioning the integrity of the officials.""

Here is the full pool report:

QUESTION: Can you explain why Ja Morant was assessed the first technical foul during the second quarter? GOBLE: Morant was assessed a technical foul for use of profanity directed at an official. QUESTION: Can you explain why Ja Morant was assessed the second technical foul during the second quarter? GOBLE: Morant was assessed his second technical foul for making a comment questioning the integrity of the officials. QUESTION: It appears Morant was speaking to a fan when he was assessed the second technical foul. Was the technical foul assessed as a result of conversation or actions toward the crowd? GOBLE: No.

Morant clearly didn't buy Goble's version of events. He tweeted out a photo of a person wearing several caps referring to a slang term for lying or exaggerating.

""I got my first tech for saying I got hit in my (expletive) face. Didn't curse at him"" Morant said (via The Associated Press). ""Another situation where he's in my conversation and I get another tech for talking with a fan.

""I feel like when these fans came here went online to buy these tickets they didn't say Ray (Acosta) name to come watch."""
PYPL,PayPal,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzE3L21vcmUtbGlrZWx5LXRvLTV4LWZpcnN0LXBheXBhbC12cy1ibG9jay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More Likely to 5X First: PayPal vs. Block,"The older aging icon still holds a couple of edges on the younger up-and-comer.

They look similar enough. PayPal Holdings (PYPL -2.36%) was built to facilitate online purchases using credit cards or bank accounts. Block (SQ -2.58%) -- the company formerly known as Square -- was established to give small businesses an affordable means of accepting card-based payments.

Both companies have evolved over their existence with each becoming more like the other. For instance PayPal now offers card transaction tools to small businesses often not served by larger payment processors while Block's Cash App is much like PayPal's original peer-to-peer money transfer platform. Each is also a ""buy now pay later"" middleman.

From an investor's viewpoint though one of these names has much more upside potential than the other. That's PayPal and here's why.

2 reasons to bet on PayPal instead of Block

Don't panic if you're holding Block rather than PayPal. It's certainly possible it could end up ahead should the tide finally turn in both companies' favor. In the meantime each is facing the risk of a full-blown recession when buying and selling tend to slow.

For investors with a true long-term time frame however PayPal has the better risk/reward proposition for a couple of reasons.

PayPal is a longer-established company. Some investors will debate the merits of age as younger companies are better suited to handle more-modern opportunities. Older outfits often may have a tougher time adapting (Polaroid Blockbuster and Toys R Us are a few examples).

There's a flip side to this argument however. Not all new opportunities are great ones. Meal kit company Blue Apron remains in the red largely because the fiscal math behind the business doesn't always make sense. But enthusiasm was certainly sky-high when Blue Apron launched in 2012 like much of the enthusiasm intermittently surrounding Block since its inception.

That's not to suggest Block is more like Blue Apron and less like PayPal. It would be naive however to ignore how Block made a huge bet on cryptocurrency Bitcoin back in 2017 when it rolled out the ability to buy and sell the digital currency to its app's users. The company doubled down on its bet by outright buying $50 million worth of Bitcoin in 2020 then changing its name to Block (a nod to Bitcoin's underlying blockchain coding) late last year. Since then the future of Bitcoin has come into question as the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem might be starting to implode.

Bitcoin is only one of Block's profit centers and it's not a particularly big one. Given the sheer depth of the bet the company made on just one cryptocurrency though it might have fundamentally altered how it's organized and how it operates to support the now-wobbly growth prospect.

PayPal is playing a cryptocurrency-based hand as well. But it's not making the same narrowly focused bet and certainly a smaller wager. PayPal now simply allows users to buy sell and transfer cryptos Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash Ethereum and Litecoin hedging its bet by offering access to four of the world's most popular cryptocurrencies. Its core focus remains on more-traditional transactions using fiat currency.

The second reason PayPal shares are better positioned for a bigger recovery than Block is that PayPal's more advanced age makes it much easier for the market to believe in it.

In some ways this advantage manifests itself in the two companies' differing results. PayPal's net profit margins are consistently higher than Block's for instance leading to more predictable results and fewer disappointments. PayPal is also sitting on significantly more cash. Specifically it has more than $10 billion in cash or near-cash instruments and roughly another $40 billion in loans and receivables that can help address any near-term liquidity problems.

These nuances seem minor on the surface but when liquidity ultimately means flexibility they're a big deal.

And PayPal's seniority makes a difference in consumers' perception of it. Most of the world has at least heard of it even if not everyone is a user which is why it still enjoys a leading market share of the payment space.

Block's Cash App doesn't even come close in terms of recognition or reach even if it's not necessarily going head-to-head with PayPal.

At the same time although Block's card-swiping reach is estimated to be on the order of 2 million merchants much of that growth was achieved before PayPal stepped up its efforts to better serve small businesses. Indeed PayPal only unveiled its all-in-one Zettle point-of-sale terminal in October giving small businesses everything they need in one integrated system at a very affordable price. Look for this tech to put even more pressure on Block's hold of the card-swiping market.

It's ultimately all about perceptions from here

Both companies are likely to struggle under the weight of any economic weakness on the horizon; it could be a while before either stock soars. Conversely both companies have proved they can grow their similar businesses. Each could soar again at some point in the future.

But because a five-bagger is going to be rooted in recovering what was lost and then continuing to build on previously established foundations PayPal is the stronger play here. Block is still more of an unknown -- a moving target in flux. PayPal shares won't face the same degree of ""show me first"" doubts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vbmZ0cGxhemFzLmNvbS9tZXRhbWFzay1hbmQtcGF5cGFsL9IBLmh0dHBzOi8vbmZ0cGxhemFzLmNvbS9tZXRhbWFzay1hbmQtcGF5cGFsL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MetaMask and PayPal Partner for Seamless Crypto Trading,"MetaMask and PayPal Partner for Seamless Crypto Trading

And if you've earned money through digital wallet apps like Cash App PayPal Zelle or Venmo then there is a good chance the IRS knows about it and you will have to report it as a potential income.

It's part of the 2021 American Rescue Plan where third-party payment platforms will now issue a 1099-K form for users to track business transactions for tax purposes.

""But you have to distinguish between business transactions and personal transfers"" saidDr. Agustin Arbulu President COO and Tax Counsel with W Tax Group.

Tax expert Dr. Agustin says even personal accounts on these apps are not exempt.

""If PayPal or Venmo looks at your account and says this account looks slightly different compared to other transactions triggered thought out the year a 1099-K could be issued"" said Dr. Agustin.

Erica Shavez has been relying heavily on cash apps this holiday season and that's why she is a little concerned.

""I do yes and I think Facebook Marketplace for instance and how a lot of that could be personal transactions maybe people will find other ways to sell their goods"" said Erica Shavez Cash App user.

But if you are worried about getting a 1099-K form for your personal transactions Dr. Agustin says the best thing to do is not to file your taxes early.

""If you seek an extension wait until October of the following year you will have the full record of all your transactions of the prior year that were reported to the Internal Revenue Service and from there you can make an intelligent decision"" said Dr. Arbulu.

The new rule does not apply to folks sending money to friends or family. However any form of profits will be reportable. For example if you purchased a vintage clock for $300 and sold it for $1000 the earning of $700 is taxable. That's why Auggies says moving forward transactions will be heavily scrutinized.

""Financial institutions are going to be inquiring more about the user to make sure that particular account is personal and is not being mixed with business.

Dr. Agustin says people who heavily rely on cash apps don't have to stress about it because there are several options to explore including filling an Offer in Compromise (OIC). An OIC also known as IRS form 656-L allows taxpayers to dispute part of or all tax debt owed.

Meanwhile if people have any questions or doubts about filing their taxes then make sure you reach out to an expert.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vY2x1dGNocG9pbnRzLmNvbS9lbG9uLW11c2stbmV0LXdvcnRoLTIwMjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk's Net Worth in 2022,"Supplanting Jeff Bezos as the richest man in the whole world Elon Musk's net worth in 2022 has been a trending topic on the internet. Elon Musk is an entrepreneur business tycoon and inventor best known for Tesla SpaceX and his purchase of Twitter for $44 billion earlier this year. In this piece we'll be looking at Elon Musk's net worth in 2022.

Elon Musk's net worth in 2022 (estimated): $164 Billion

Elon Musk's net worth in 2022 is estimated to be around $164 billion making him the second-richest person in the world. According to reputable sources his net worth was once almost a hundred billion dollars more than the second richest persons in the world Bernard Arnault & family – but he has since dropped just right below them after his actions in 2022 dragged down the valuation of his companies. Still Musk remains one of the richest techno-billionaires in the world ahead of Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates.

Elon Reeve-Musk is a Canadian-American entrepreneur born to a Canadian mother and a South African mother. Musk spent his early childhood in South Africa. He'd finish his college education at the University of Pennsylvania after transferring from Queen's University. He was accepted for a Ph.D. degree program in materials science at Stanford University before dropping out to focus on his startup: Zip2.

Musk would later co-found X.com which would focus on digital banking leading to his partnership with the founders of Confinity which later on become PayPal. Musk is therefore a part of the PayPal Mafia a group of former PayPal employees and founders who later on became successful technopreneurs of their own right founding their own companies. This illustrious group includes PayPal CEO Peter Thiel Youtube's Chad Hurley Linkedin's Reid Hoffman and Yelp's Russel Simmons just to name a few.

Musk was PayPal's biggest shareholder when eBay went in to purchase it giving him $100 million to add to his net worth at that time even though he had just been ousted as PayPal's CEO.

He would use this money to found and fund SpaceX now the world's most significant aerospace company that services even NASA. His vision for SpaceX is to produce rockets that are much more affordable than how they traditionally were and his hands-on approach to the company's operations allowed him to remain as its Chief Engineer and CEO since its founding in 2002. He owns 47.4% of SpaceX's $100 billion valuation giving Musk a hefty sum of wealth just from SpaceX.

Twenty years of experience in leading SpaceX is impressive enough but Elon Musk accomplished way more than that. Another notable company that Elon is associated with was Tesla which revolutionized the electric car concept from science fiction to reality. Although he didn't found the company himself his contributions to the company cannot be denied and his initial investment of $6.5 million into the company in 2004 allowed the company to develop different models of Tesla until it finally developed the consumer-grade vehicles we have today. Even though Musk isn't as involved as he once was with Tesla he still owns 17% of Tesla's equity giving him an additional $5 billion in his net worth.

Musk also founded and owns Neuralink in 2016 a neurotechnology startup that aims to integrate the human brain with Artificial Intelligence. He also founded The Boring Company in 2016 an infrastructure and tunnel construction services company. The company aims to serve society with intra-city looping tunnels for the conceptual Hyperloop transportation system a way to make travel fast between cities. There are three such looping tunnels now two in Las Vegas and another in Los Angeles County.

Apart from his business ventures Elon Musk is also known for his eccentric personality and controversial public persona. Elon's words on social media giant Twitter moved the stock value of companies before both for better or for worse.

Probably just to show the world just how much power and influence he has in his hands Elon Musk's ultimate flex came when he purchased Twitter itself for $44 billion. Apart from showing that this man has way too much money than any person has the right to have Musk's purchase of Twitter is more of a statement. What will he be doing with Twitter? Well Musk plans to be hands-on with the company again just like how he handled his previous business ventures. To be specific Musk plans to reform the social media platform advocating free speech and transparency in the platform's coding of its search and trending algorithms. So far these have been hollow promises and Musk has actually brought the opposite to Twitter.

While Musk's hostile takeover of Twitter raged on the stock value of Tesla and some of Musk's other ventures flunked momentarily but still held considerable value – high enough to dissuade any fears of failure. While these did affect Musk's net worth and made his current value of $163.7 billion way lower compared to last year's $278 billion Elon Musk's net worth in 2022 is still by far one of the highest that any human being in history has ever accumulated.",,,

Now the multinational beverage company reveals that it plans to make 100 Tesla Semi trucks operational in 2023 Reuters reported.

PepsiCo’s VP of Supply Chain Service & Distribution Mike O’Connell said that the company is not just buying the Tesla Semi class-8 logistics trucks but also setting up Megacharger stations at its factory locations.

Since PepsiCo is only using these trucks in California as of now Mike told Reuters that these charging stations are now being built at its Modesto and Sacramento facilities. PepsiCo is installing four 750-kilowatt charging stalls at each of these locations.

Frito-Lay which is a PepsiCo subsidiary is using the Tesla Semi truck to deliver its products to superstores such as Walmart Albertsons and Kroger. Tesla delivered two Tesa Semi trucks with the Pepsi and Frito-Lay branding on the delivery day. Both of these trucks are getting spotted on public roads doing sprints between Sacramento and Modesto California (videos below).

So cool to see @Tesla Semi and Tesla car at same time driving side by side. Spotted in Modesto by one of @teslaownersSV members. Green future is here! 💚⚡ pic.twitter.com/WooHRZTx6C — Endrina Pavlić (@EPavlic) December 16 2022 Video: Frito-Lay’s Tesla Semi truck spotted in Modesto California — accelerating like a car while its trailer is attached.

As we can see in the video above the acceleration of Frito-Lay’s Tesla Semi is impressive running beside a Tesla Model S. With the trailer attached (not sure if it is filled or empty) it is able to accelerate just like a Tesla car would on a highway. A Tri-Motor powertrain and a massive battery pack are behind the impressive acceleration of the Tesa Semi.

Mike O’Connell also shared range and charging information which is particularly interesting. For the 425-mile (684-km) trip between the factories the Tesla Semi utilizes around 80% of its battery capacity. According to Mike the truck then is recharged to around full in just 35 – 45 minutes.

To build these 750-kilowatt DC fast charging Megacharger stations Tesla provided PepsiCo with the design and engineering support while the company used its own resources to build them at its departure and arrival locations.

PepsiCo intends to station 15 Tesla Semi trucks at its Modesto CA facility and 21 at its Sacramento location in 2023. However the company did not disclose where it plans to use the rest of the 64 Tesla Semis it expects to get deliveries next year.

Tesla (TSLA) is producing its electric Semi trucks at its Gigafactory in Sparks Nevada. Tesla is holding two key information pieces a secret from the public and did not reveal on the delivery day as well — one is the battery capacity and the other is the load capacity of the trailer that it can pull while keeping the range intact.

PepsiCo Inc which ordered the big trucks in 2017 is purchasing them ""outright"" and is also upgrading its plants including installing four 750-kilowatt Tesla Inc charging stalls at both its Modesto and Sacramento locations in California PepsiCo Vice President Mike O'Connell said in an interview. A $15.4 million state grant and $40000 federal subsidy per vehicle helps offset part of the costs.

""It's a great starting point to electrify"" said O'Connell who oversees the company's fleet of vehicles.

""Like any early technology the incentives help us build out the program"" he said adding that there were ""lots"" of development and infrastructure costs.

PepsiCo is the first company to experiment with the battery-powered Tesla Semis as a way of cutting its environmental impact.

United Parcel Service Inc and food delivery company Sysco Corp have also reserved the trucks while retailer Walmart Inc is testing alternatives.

PepsiCo's plans to use the Semis have been reported but O'Connell provided new details on how the company is using them and its timeline for deploying them. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk initially said the trucks would be in production by 2019 but that was delayed due to battery constraints.

PepsiCo said it plans to deploy 15 trucks from Modesto and 21 from Sacramento. It is unclear where the others will be based but O'Connell said the firm is targeting rolling out the Semis in the central United States next and then the East Coast.

The company's Frito-Lay division sells lightweight food products making it a good candidate for electric trucks which have heavy batteries that could limit cargo capacity.

The Semis will haul Frito-Lay food products for around 425 miles (684 km) but for heavier loads of sodas the trucks will initially do shorter trips of around 100 miles (160 km) O'Connell said. PepsiCo then will also use the Semis to haul beverages in the ""400 to 500 mile range as well"" O'Connell said.

""Dragging a trailer full of chips around is not the most intense tough ask"" said Oliver Dixon senior analyst at consultancy Guidehouse.

""I still believe that Tesla has an awful lot to prove to the broader commercial vehicle marketplace"" Dixon said citing Tesla's unwillingness to offer information on payload and pricing.

PepsiCo has earmarked some of the trucks planned for the Sacramento location to make deliveries to Walmart and grocers such as Kroger Co and Albertsons Cos Inc. The trucks at the Modesto Frito-Lay plant have just gone to PepsiCo distribution centers O'Connell said.

All of the Semis going to PepsiCo will have a 500-mile (805-km) range. O'Connell added that he is not aware of when Tesla will start deploying 300-mile (480-km) trucks. When Tesla starts building them PepsiCo ""will rotate those up"" into its fleet he said.

PepsiCo declined to share details on the price of the trucks a figure that Tesla has kept quiet. Competing vehicles sell for $230000 to $240000 said Mark Barrott of consulting firm Plante Moran. He added that the 500-mile range Tesla Semi could be priced higher because its 1000-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery pack is about twice the size of many of its rivals.

""We keep the trucks for a million miles seven years"" O'Connell said. ""The operating costs over time will pay back.""

The Gatorade maker declined to share specifics on the weight of the trucks another closely guarded secret by Tesla.

He said Tesla did not help pay for the trucks' megachargers but provided design and engineering services for the facilities which come with solar and battery storage systems.

O'Connell said that a 425-mile (684-km) trip carrying Frito-Lay products brings the Semi's battery down to roughly 20% and recharging it takes around 35 to 45 minutes.

It had been reported in the past but O'Connell went into more detail on how the trucks will be utilized.Not only is Pepsico a soda maker but it also makes chips under the Frito-Lay brand which are much lighter in weight than soda making it reasonable to assume the company will use the trucks in that capacity.To support that reasoning O'Connell outlined that a 425-mile (684-km) trip carrying Frito-Lay products would use roughly 80% of the Semi's and take just 35 to 45 minutes to fully recharge.It remains to be seen exactly what products the truck will deliver but a sign that they will deliver soda took place recently as trucks from the Frito-lay plant were sent to PepsiCo distribution centers.All of the trucks originally ordered in 2017 are of the 500-mile (805-km)- range variety and Pepsico is uncertain as to when Tesla will start deploying the 300-mile (480-km) range trucks.While the company did not disclose the cost of each Semi they did say the operating cost will pay back over time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vdGVzbGEtc2VtaS1mcml0by1sYXktaGlnaHdheS_SATtodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZXNsYXJhdGkuY29tL3Rlc2xhLXNlbWktZnJpdG8tbGF5LWhpZ2h3YXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Semi for Frito Lay spotted cruising down the highway,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vdGVzbGEtc2VtaS1mcml0by1sYXktaGlnaHdheS_SATtodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZXNsYXJhdGkuY29tL3Rlc2xhLXNlbWktZnJpdG8tbGF5LWhpZ2h3YXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024DFE0EA680>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Next year sticker shock awaits,"Nearly 6 million Americans have taken Paxlovid for free courtesy of the federal government. The Pfizer pill has helped prevent many people infected with COVID-19 from being hospitalized or dying and it may even reduce the risk of developing long COVID. But the government plans to stop footing the bill within months and millions of people who are at the highest risk of severe illness and are least able to afford the drug — the uninsured and seniors — may have to pay the full price.

And that means fewer people will get the potentially lifesaving treatments experts said.

“I think the numbers will go way down” said Jill Rosenthal director of public health policy at the Center for American Progress a left-leaning think tank. A bill for several hundred dollars or more would lead many people to decide the medication isn’t worth the price she said.

In response to the unprecedented public health crisis caused by COVID the federal government spent billions of dollars on developing new vaccines and treatments to swift success: Less than a year after the pandemic was declared medical workers got their first vaccines. But as many people have refused the shots and stopped wearing masks the virus still rages and mutates. In 2022 alone 250000 Americans have died from COVID more than from strokes or diabetes.

But soon the Department of Health and Human Services will stop supplying COVID treatments and pharmacies will purchase and bill for them the same way they do for antibiotic pills or asthma inhalers. Paxlovid is expected to hit the private market in mid-2023 according to HHS plans shared in an October meeting with state health officials and clinicians. Merck’s Lagevrio a less-effective COVID treatment pill and AstraZeneca’s Evusheld a preventive therapy for the immunocompromised are on track to be commercialized sooner sometime in the winter.

WATCH: Merck’s antiviral pill may help beat COVID-19 but vaccines and testing still needed

The U.S. government has so far purchased 20 million courses of Paxlovid priced at about $530 each a discount for buying in bulk that Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla called “really very attractive” to the federal government in a July earnings call. The drug will cost far more on the private market although in a statement to KHN Pfizer declined to share the planned price. The government will also stop paying for the company’s COVID vaccine next year — those shots will quadruple in price from the discount rate the government pays of $30 to about $120.

Bourla told investors in November that he expects the move will make Paxlovid and its COVID vaccine “a multibillion-dollars franchise.”

Nearly 9 in 10 people dying from the virus now are 65 or older. Yet federal law restricts Medicare Part D — the prescription drug program that covers nearly 50 million seniors — from covering the COVID treatment pills. The medications are meant for those most at risk of serious illness including seniors.

Paxlovid and the other treatments are currently available under an emergency use authorization from the FDA a fast-track review used in extraordinary situations. Although Pfizer applied for full approval in June the process can take anywhere from several months to years. And Medicare Part D can’t cover any medications without that full stamp of approval.

Paying out-of-pocket would be “a substantial barrier” for seniors on Medicare — the very people who would benefit most from the drug wrote federal health experts.

“From a public health perspective and even from a health care capacity and cost perspective it would just defy reason to not continue to make these drugs readily available” said Dr. Larry Madoff medical director of Massachusetts’ Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences. He’s hopeful that the federal health agency will find a way to set aside unused doses for seniors and people without insurance.

In mid-November the White House requested that Congress approve an additional $2.5 billion for COVID therapeutics and vaccines to make sure people can afford the medications when they’re no longer free. But there’s little hope it will be approved — the Senate voted that same day to end the public health emergency and denied similar requests in recent months.

Many Americans have already faced hurdles just getting a prescription for COVID treatment. Although the federal government doesn’t track who’s gotten the drug a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study using data from 30 medical centers found that Black and Hispanic patients with COVID were much less likely to receive Paxlovid than white patients. (Hispanic people can be of any race or combination of races.) And when the government is no longer picking up the tab experts predict that these gaps by race income and geography will widen.

People in Northeastern states used the drug far more often than those in the rest of the country according to a KHN analysis of Paxlovid use in September and October. But it wasn’t because people in the region were getting sick from COVID at much higher rates — instead many of those states offered better access to health care to begin with and created special programs to get Paxlovid to their residents.

About 10 mostly Democratic states and several large counties in the Northeast and elsewhere created free “test-to-treat” programs that allow their residents to get an immediate doctor visit and prescription for treatment after testing positive for COVID. In Massachusetts more than 20000 residents have used the state’s video and phone hotline which is available seven days a week in 13 languages. Massachusetts which has the highest insurance rate in the country and relatively low travel times to pharmacies had the second-highest Paxlovid usage rate among states this fall.

WATCH: White House reveals winter COVID-19 plans more free tests

States with higher COVID death rates like Florida and Kentucky where residents must travel farther for health care and are more likely to be uninsured used the drug less often. Without no-cost test-to-treat options residents have struggled to get prescriptions even though the drug itself is still free.

“If you look at access to medications for people who are uninsured I think that there’s no question that will widen those disparities” Rosenthal said.

People who get insurance through their jobs could face high copays at the register too just as they do for insulin and other expensive or brand-name drugs.

Most private insurance companies will end up covering COVID therapeutics to some extent said Sabrina Corlette a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. After all the pills are cheaper than a hospital stay. But for most people who get insurance through their jobs there are “really no rules at all” she said. Some insurers could take months to add the drugs to their plans or decide not to pay for them.

And the additional cost means many people will go without the medication. “We know from lots of research that when people face cost sharing for these drugs that they need to take they will often forgo or cut back” Corlette said.

One group doesn’t need to worry about sticker shock. Medicaid the public insurance program for low-income adults and children will cover the treatments in full until at least early 2024.

HHS officials could set aside any leftover taxpayer-funded medication for people who can’t afford to pay the full cost but they haven’t shared any concrete plans to do so. The government purchased 20 million courses of Paxlovid and 3 million of Lagevrio. Fewer than a third have been used and usage has fallen in recent months according to KHN’s analysis of the data from HHS.

Sixty percent of the government’s supply of Evusheld is also still available although the COVID prevention therapy is less effective against new strains of the virus. The health department in one state New Mexico has recommended against using it.

HHS did not make officials available for an interview or answer written questions about the commercialization plans.

The government created a potential workaround when they moved bebtelovimab another COVID treatment to the private market this summer. It now retails for $2100 per patient. The agency set aside the remaining 60000 government-purchased doses that hospitals could use to treat uninsured patients in a convoluted dose-replacement process. But it’s hard to tell how well that setup would work for Paxlovid: Bebtelovimab was already much less popular and the FDA halted its use on Nov. 30 because it’s less effective against current strains of the virus.

Federal officials and insurance companies would have good reason to make sure patients can continue to afford COVID drugs: They’re far cheaper than if patients land in the emergency room.

“The medications are so worthwhile” said Madoff the Massachusetts health official. “They’re not expensive in the grand scheme of health care costs.”

However the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late Pfizer has been doing relatively well. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially which has repressed the P/E. If not then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price.

What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?

The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as low as Pfizer's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market.

Taking a look back first we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 54% last year. Pleasingly EPS has also lifted 85% in aggregate from three years ago thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.

Turning to the outlook the next three years should bring diminished returns with earnings decreasing 14% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile the broader market is forecast to expand by 9.3% per annum which paints a poor picture.

With this information we are not surprised that Pfizer is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Nonetheless there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.

The Final Word

Typically we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.

We've established that Pfizer maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings as expected. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.

It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Pfizer and understanding should be part of your investment process.

After the untimely cardiac death of his father Dr Aseem Malhotra a consultant cardiologist and an internationally renowned expert in the prevention diagnosis and management of heart disease who was one of the first to receive the double Pfizer Covid-19 mRNA vaccine in January 2021 started to thoroughly examine the real world data relating to mRNA vaccines. His examination culminated in a two-part paper titled ‘Curing the pandemic of misinformation on Covid-19 mRNA vaccines through real evidence-based medicine’ the public release of which was embargoed until late last night. The paper reveals glaring holes in the pivotal Pfizer mRNA trials and findings drawn from available pharmacovigilance data (as well as the absence of robust safety data) which led Dr Malhotra to describe the mRNA vaccine roll-out into the entire population as “a reckless gamble at best”. Endorsed by many leading medical professionals the paper emphasises that conversations in which the difference between the absolute and relative risk reduction afforded by the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines was explained to patients (a mere 0.84% as suggested by the Pfizer mRNA trial) simply did not happen not to mention the “known unknown and as yet to be fully quantified harms”. Published in the Journal of Insulin Resistance the paper has led to calls for the suspension of all Covid-19 vaccines. – Nadya Swart

‘Peer-reviewed papers in the Journal of Insulin Resistance present findings leading to calls for the suspension of all Covid-19 vaccines’

In a two-part paper titled “Curing the pandemic of misinformation on Covid-19 mRNA vaccines through real evidence-based medicine” real world data reveals that in the non-elderly population the number needed to vaccinate to prevent one death from Covid-19 runs into thousands and that re-analysis of randomised controlled trial data suggests a greater risk of suffering a serious adverse event from the vaccine than of being hospitalised with Covid-19.

Speaking about the report Dr Malhotra said:

“There has been a rise in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and heart attacks linked to Pfizer’s Covid-19 mRNA vaccine with plausible biological mechanisms of harm”

“Pharmacovigilance systems and real-world safety data coupled with plausible mechanisms of harm are deeply concerning especially in relation to cardiovascular safety”

SUSPEND ALL COVID-19 MRNA VACCINES UNTIL SIDE EFFECTS (INCLUDING ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES) ARE FULLY INVESTIGATED AND RELEASE RAW DATA SAY LEADING DOCTORS

Doctor who promoted Covid-19 vaccine on TV calls for an immediate suspension to all Covid-19 vaccines to investigate serious side effects.

In new peer reviewed research eminent consultant cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra exposes compelling evidence to suspend the roll out of all Covid-19 mRNA vaccines to investigate side effects and until all the raw data from clinical trials are released for independent scrutiny.

Recent re-analysis of Pfizer and Moderna randomised controlled trial data suggests the risk of suffering serious adverse effects of mRNA vaccines for individuals is significantly higher than the risk of being hospitalised with Covid-19.

There is a rise in out of hospital cardiac arrests and heart attacks linked to Pfizer’s Covid-19 mRNA vaccine with a plausible biological mechanism of harm.

The son of a leading GP claims the Covid-19 vaccine is a likely contributory factor in his father’s sudden cardiac death. The Journal of Insulin resistance paper gets widespread praise and support by leading doctors that include the President of the International Vascular Society Professor Sherif Sultan Jay Bhattacharya Professor of Medicine at the University of Stanford Clinical Advisor to the Royal College of General Practitioners Dr Campbell Murdoch and Chair of the West Pennine Local Medical Committee General Practitioner Dr Amir Hannan MBE. *see quotes from the medical profession in section below*

Leading doctors have supported calls to suspend all COVID-19 mRNA vaccines until serious side effects are fully investigated and the raw trial data from Pfizer’s covid -19 vaccine trial is released for independent analysis to help determine the true benefits and potential harms for different age groups.

Writing in the peer-reviewed Journal of Insulin Resistance one of the UK’s most eminent consultant cardiologists Dr Aseem Malhotra who was one of the first to take two doses of the vaccine and promote it on ITV’s Good Morning Britain (GMB) says that since the roll out of the vaccine the evidence of its effectiveness and true rates of adverse events have changed.

In a two part research paper entitled “Curing the pandemic of misinformation on COVID-19 mRNA vaccines through real evidence-based medicine” real world data reveals that in the non-elderly population the number needed to vaccinate to prevent one death from Covid-19 runs into thousands and that re-analysis of randomised controlled trial data (that first led to approval of the vaccines for BionTech/Pfizer and Moderna) suggests a greater risk of suffering a serious adverse event from the vaccine than of being hospitalised with Covid-19.

Dr Malhotra writes “Pharmacovigilance systems and real-world safety data coupled with plausible mechanisms of harm are sending deeply concerning signals especially in relation to cardiovascular safety”.

Mirroring a potential signal from the Pfizer Phase 3 clinical trial a significant rise in cardiac arrest calls to ambulances in England was seen in 2021 (an extra 14000 compared to 2020) with similar data emerging from Israel in the 16–39-year-old age group where there was a 25% increase in heart attacks or cardiac arrests associated with the BionTech Pfizer vaccine administration but not associated with Covid-19.

Citing the FDA’s own website Dr Malhotra also highlights that testing positive for antibodies is an unreliable marker for immunity or protection against Covid after vaccination. He writes “It cannot be said that the consent to receive these agents was fully informed as is required ethically and legally” and “Authorities and sections of the medical profession have supported unethical coercive and misinformed policies such as vaccine mandates and vaccine passports undermining the principles of informed consent. These regrettable actions are a symptom of the ‘medical misinformation mess’—the tip of a mortality iceberg where prescribed medications are estimated to be the third most common cause of death globally after heart disease and cancer.”

Underlying causes for this failure include regulatory capture. Guardians that are supposed to protect the public are in fact funded by the very corporations that stand to gain from the sale of those medications. A failure of public health messaging has also resulted in wanton waste of resources and a missed opportunity to help individuals lead healthier lives with relatively simple—and low cost—lifestyle changes.

The unprecedented roll-out of an emergency use authorisation vaccine without access to the raw data with increasing evidence of significant harms compounded by mandates that appear to serve no purpose other than to bolster the profits of the drug industry have highlighted modern medicine’s worst failings on an epic scale with additional catastrophic harms to trust in public health.

There is a strong scientific ethical and moral case to be made that the current COVID vaccine administration must stop until all the raw data has been subjected to fully independent scrutiny. Looking to the future the medical and public health professionals must recognise these failings and eschew the tainted dollar of the medical-industrial complex. It will take a lot of time and effort to rebuild trust in these institutions but the health of both humanity and the medical profession depend on it.

Dr Malhotra concludes “We must use this as an opportunity to transform the system to produce better doctors better decision making healthier patients and restore trust in medicine and public health. Until all the raw data on the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been independently analysed any claims purporting that they confer a net benefit to humankind cannot be considered to be evidence-based.”

REACTION FROM THE MEDICAL PROFESSION:

Sherif Sultan Professor of Vascular Surgery and President of the International Vascular Society

“Doctor Aseem Malhotra’s literature review and analysis is a cause for global concern. We fully believe that vaccines are one of the great discoveries in medicine that has improved life expectancy dramatically. However mRNA genetic vaccines are different as long-term safety evaluation is lacking but mandatory to ensure public safety. These findings raise concerns regarding vaccine-induced undetected severe cardiovascular side effects and underscore the established causal relationship between vaccines and myocarditis a frequent cause of unexpected cardiac arrest in young individuals. Surveillance of potential vaccineside-effects and COVID-19 outcomes to identify public health trends and promptly investigate potential underlying causes needs immediate attention.”

Jay Bhattacharya Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Stanford

“Dr Aseem Malhotra has written a detailed narrative review of the literature on the uses and abuses of the mRNA covid vaccines. Dr Malhotra makes a good case that there is considerable heterogeneity across age groups and other comorbid conditions in the expected benefits and expected side effect profiles of the vaccine. He finds that while there may be a case for older people to take the vaccine because the benefits may outweigh expected harm that may not be the case for younger people. Dr. Malhotra’s paper calls for a pause in the use of the vaccine in younger people such as the one recently adopted by Danish public health authorities and the Florida department of public health in the United States. He calls for investigation of side effect profiles of mRNA vaccines and for a halt to any vaccine mandate programs involving Covid vaccines. These papers should be considered carefully by all public health authorities who seek to adopt principles of evidence-based medicine in their recommendations to the public regarding the Covid mRNA vaccines.”

Dr Amir Hannan MBE General Practitioner and Chairman of the West Pennine Local Medical Committee Greater Manchester

“Dr Aseem Malhotra should be congratulated for putting this all together to help inform the public the medical profession the regulators government the pharmaceutical industry and wider society. Drug treatments and vaccinations can be an important part in helping to overcome disease and prevent illness but we must remain vigilant against over reliance on the benefits and minimising or even suppressing the harms. Greater scrutiny of the data is needed and those overseeing medical practice to ensure the public and the profession remain safe. An urgent review is needed of the materials and information provided on the COVID-19 vaccines to help inform the public so that informed consent is gained through a shared decision-making process with education and training in light of the new evidence emerging.”

Dr Campbell Murdoch General Practitioner and Clinical Advisor to the Royal College of General Practitioners

“Provision of safe and effective healthcare sits at the heart of medical services. As a GP this is central to every action I take with patients. The healthcare regulator in England the Care Quality Commission requires this from all providers of medical care. As Dr Malhotra describes to be able to provide safe and effective care all healthcare professionals must practice evidence-based medicine. This is a combination of using the best available scientific evidence the patient’s preferences and the healthcare professional’s expertise. The combination of these three factors allows patients to make informed choices about what is best for their health.

“In the case of the COVID-19 vaccination Dr Malhotra describes multiple systemic failures in the provision of safe and effective evidence-based medicine. Consequently it has been impossible for patients and the public to make an informed choice about what is best for their health and life.

High quality healthcare requires organisations and individuals to act with complete integrity. Without this the delivery of safe and effective healthcare will always fail.

“Errors in healthcare can provide an opportunity to improve. It is now time to reflect and learn from the experience of the COVID-19 vaccination. Healthcare must always help not harm.”

Dr Bob Gill General Practitioner activist and producer of the documentary The Great NHS Heist

“This important two-part review of the impact of the international roll-out of the mRNA vaccination program highlights significant concerns about the overstated benefits of vaccination especially in low-risk populations and the under-reporting of adverse events. Public information and consent to vaccination has not been balanced neglecting discussion of individual risk versus benefit of having the shot. The quality of evidence provided by vaccine producers and lack of openness from the pharmaceutical industry risk longlasting damage to confidence in public health interventions.

Part Two of the review sets out how regulatory capture by pharmaceutical corporations and their immense financial power influences politicians and media to promote products at the expense of scientific scrutiny and unfettered access to research on which decisions of immense impact are made. Bias and conflicts of interest abound in the medical-industrial complex with well documented adverse outcomes for patients from over medicalisation and prescription drugs. Coercive vaccine mandates based on biased and short trials with unpublished raw data is the culmination of the unchecked power of the pharmaceutical industry to the exclusion of effective lifestyle factor risk reduction which was ignored by media and politicians alike.

Given the declining virulence of the infection and mounting evidence of vaccine-related harms there can be no justification to continued mass roll-out of booster programs given that the short-term risks from the vaccine likely outweigh the benefits for the majority of the population and we remain ignorant of the long-term risk to health.”

Dr Renee Hoenderkamp General Practitioner writer and broadcaster

“This is an important paper from Aseem. As a GP in a small practice I have two young patients with post vaccine heart conditions confirmed. They were not counselled on the risk of this as part of an informed consent process. Surely any medical professionals should want their patients to fully understand the risks and benefits of a medication they take and welcome that discussion? As the evidence evolves and we see clearly that the risk from both Covid-19 and the vaccine designed to protect against it differs massively by age sex co-morbidity and previous infection it becomes ever more important to give patients the information they need to make an informed decision. This important paper brings those risks and benefits into sharp focus and should allow the desperately needed discussion that has thus far been sorely missing from any examination of vaccination benefits and harms. Aseem opens up the discussion around both the harms and the ability to have a healthy discourse and I welcome it.”

“Sports medicine today is still extremely primitive” said Kentaro Onishi an assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and doctor on the International Olympic Committee. Using ultrasound technology to guide his procedures Onishi has been able to adapt some common surgeries to be much less invasive.

But the treatment for many of the most common injuries he treats — tendon problems — is still largely limited to managing symptoms. He and other researchers are trying to develop new technologies to change that though. With funding from the Department of Defense he is working to develop a lotion that will target the molecule that scars and destroys tissue relieving athletes from developing tendonitis and other conditions that damage tendons. The idea he said is that athletes could one day “slap [it] on before you go work out like a sunscreen.” New options like this for athletes “change the paradigm of treatment” he added. “We can prevent a tendon from ever getting injured.”

STAT spoke with Onishi about his use of technology to help elite athletes and the state of sports medicine as a field. The conversation has been condensed and lightly edited.

How do you think the World Cup is handling injuries?

I think they’re doing a great job. In the previous World Cups they’ve returned people with concussions on the same day and that was a little bit you know controversial. But this World Cup particularly I don’t think that there was anything that stood out to me that was considered a bad call. Seemed like the doctors are doing really well.

Can you talk about your experience in the 2021 Summer Olympics in Tokyo?

Tokyo happens to be my hometown and that was my childhood dream to be an Olympic doctor… And six years after my fellowship training in sports medicine at Mayo [Clinic] I returned to my homeland as an Olympic doctor working with the IOC research team. And so that was kind of a really nice way to make your childhood dream come true full circle in your home city.

Kentaro Onishi Courtesy University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

My work was to bring ultrasound technology which has become extremely portable nowadays. It fits in your jacket pocket and basically allows you to see through the skin to make a diagnosis from the sideline [of] a fracture or tendon muscle tears. So surprisingly the Olympics never really had it as a standard offering to Olympians competing at the venue. They traditionally had an ultrasound in what we call Polyclinic the central location where all the athletes stay sleep eat where a multidisciplinary sports medicine clinic exists… But at the venue is a different story.

And what was unique about the Tokyo Olympics was the fact that it was the largest human sporting event and the first mega sports event held inside the Covid bubble. So transferring the athletes from a place to another place runs the risks of athletes getting an infection. Dr. Freddie Fu who was the long term Chair of orthopedic department at the University of Pittsburgh suggested ultrasound should be brought to the athletes as opposed to bringing the athletes to the imaging…

We piloted what we call the IOC venue ultrasound program at the Tokyo Olympics for the first formal offering to the athletes at seven different venues and these sports included basketball a three-by-three basketball which was a new sport in Tokyo rugby seven BMX indoor men’s and women’s volleyball and handball.

These choices are based on another research project I worked with during the Tokyo Olympics the injury illness surveillance program which surveys the injuries that occur during the Olympics so we understand which sports are high-risk that require a good medical support team… In many of these cases having ultrasound at the venue actually allowed doctors to make a better decision by virtue of having imaging information as opposed to the decision made without imaging [through] clinical exam.

What is special about ultrasound compared to other imaging technology?

Imagine having a simple X-ray machine; you have to have a dedicated room so that no one else that does not need imaging gets radiation right. Same thing for MRI. MRI is an expensive device. Say the Olympics has the financial means to bring MRI to the venue. You have to have a dedicated room so that let’s say if there is a spectator with a pacemaker their pacemaker will not stop with MRI running on the field. So an ultrasound machine is the only one that can fit in your pocket but it requires a skilled physician to use. And this project really couldn’t have been done anywhere else other than Japan. Japanese doctors have a high ultrasound literacy…Of those 14 injuries evaluated using ultrasound the diagnostic accuracy compared to clinical gold standards such as MRI was 100%.

How do you use ultrasound to diagnose injuries?

Clinical examination as you know is not 100%. Doctors grab legs and move them around. And no matter how good of an examination you do or how many years of experience you have it’s never 100%. So you want to add things to increase the diagnostic accuracy as misdiagnosis will lead these people to wrong decisions. In the case of the Olympics it might make a difference between this person playing at the Olympic gold medal match versus not playing at all. So timely diagnosis in sports medicine is so crucial.

Every year athletes are pushing the needle forward in terms of what the human body can do. Do you think that sports medicine is able to keep up with these developments in sports?

Yes we can. But I think we need to change… A lot of sports medicine doctors treat their athletes based on what they are taught. And what they are taught is what was taught to their mentors by their mentors. So you basically carry down a habit not based on scientific facts. And if we keep doing that and if we don’t change this mindset we will fall behind athletes trying to do crazy things.

We are playing with the idea … that maybe humans one day can soon run a sub two-hour marathon but to do that you will obviously have to train harder with higher intensity and likely higher mileage or distances run. And with those athletes doing this type of training you anticipate increased numbers of for example tendon problems. And if you’re doing palliative care for tendinitis … the tendons will fail to achieve their functional goals. So we have to understand how the tendon gets injured on the biological basis maybe better yet the genetic basis and to understand how to reverse it instead of saying my mentor has traditionally injected steroids around the tendon to take care of tendonitis…

You have to ask the question of why you’re doing what you’re doing. And I think we just have to create independent research topics that we really have to understand the biological basis for. We have to really be diligent. The research is not elegant at all. Research takes time. It’s no one’s idea on Christmas Eve to pipette stem cells in a petri dish and wait for that to culture. But we must do that stuff so that we can come up with an innovative treatment option that would allow athletes to achieve their functional goals or performance goals.

Do you find the pressure on athletes to get back in the game can conflict with the need to treat their injuries?

Yeah I do. That’s why I kind of stick with the basic tenet of medicine: your only obligation is the patient’s concern. So I don’t really talk to coaches. Unless I hear from the athletes “I want to get back as soon as possible” I won’t pull the trigger for aggressive invasive interventions. Even though 90% of the time their goal is to go back to playing sports … I will make sure to ask the question like “Is your goal to go back to training as soon as possible?” And surprisingly sometimes that answer is not “yes” [for] some athletes. I’ve treated some Olympic-level tennis players that are like “Yeah I’m okay with this season. I have a couple of months to get better.” So you just have to ask that because you can’t assume that. Because those aggressive interventions that likely return athletes to sports quicker might carry higher risks than less invasive options. So you know you just have to be on the same page with athletes.

What have been some of the most fulfilling moments in your career?

I may not be adding years to life but I’m certainly adding quality to life… medicine has been pretty successful saving people’s lives but I don’t really think medicine has long been focused on the quality of life that you have. It’s equally fulfilling to see those individuals affected by arthritis who are elderly whose goal is to you know pull their grandchild’s hand and go for a nice hike on the beach… I think that story is as fulfilling to me as hearing like some of the top Olympic athletes competing at one of the world’s stages.

One of the top decathletes in the world has seen me for various injuries over the years and seeing him lead the world at the World Track and Field Championships… I was in Japan presenting at a conference but watching him from Japan while he’s competing and hoping that the injury I treated wouldn’t fail so it’s like a bad sweat. But when he comes through the finish line as the number one competitor in the world it’s also fulfilling. I think that you can actually tangibly see the fruits of your work in something other than just the added years of life. Doing something like that sometimes changes their entire life. If you’re talking about high school athletes getting treatment in a timely fashion to make it to the state championship and he wins that and he gets a scholarship to college… you did a small part in allowing the high school student to choose their path.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC93aGF0LXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2FsLWNvbXBhbmllcy1wYXktYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1kb2N0b3JzL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNjQ5NTA5Zjk4NzM3NzY5Njc1MzNiNWY1NDY2YmNhNTbSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHl0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tLmF1L25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvd2hhdC1waGFybWFjZXV0aWNhbC1jb21wYW5pZXMtcGF5LWF1c3RyYWxpYW4tZG9jdG9ycy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzY0OTUwOWY5ODczNzc2OTY3NTMzYjVmNTQ2NmJjYTU2P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Aussie doctors get paid by big pharma giants,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.dailytelegraph.com.au', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/national/what-pharmaceutical-companies-pay-australian-doctors/news-story/649509f9873776967533b5f5466bca56 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D80815000>, 'Connection to www.dailytelegraph.com.au timed out.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League."

She recalls a recent trip with her seven-year-old daughter Emily to a neighbourhood supermarket in Lima Peru. Emily’s eyes had been drawn to the sweets and snacks by the tills as they were leaving. As Emily had been good she was allowed a treat. “She told me ‘Mom I want chocolate’” says Luz. Emily picked out a brightly coloured pack that had caught her eye among the sweets and handed it to her mum.

It was in fact a packet of cigarettes.

“It worries me because as a mother you always try to see the best for your children” Luz 31 says matter of factly. “In this case so that they don’t try to sell your children drugs in disguise.”

“Drugs” might bring to mind stronger illegal substances but nicotine which is found in cigarettes and vapes is one of the most addictive drugs in the world. It’s what gets people hooked on tobacco which kills more than 8 million people every year.

Luz is no twitchy suburban prude. The San Juan de Lurigancho district where she raises her young sister and daughter has a tough reputation. She says there are often people doing drugs on her street at night. “The worst that can happen is that they rob you” she says.

It might seem surprising then that Luz worries so much about cigarettes. But the psychology course that she fits around her full-time job has made her more aware of what her children are exposed to and the influence it has.

“Whenever I go out with my girls there are always promotions for cigarettes in the stores” she says. “Next to the candies and gum that children like so much.” In many countries this kind of tobacco advertising is considered such a health threat that it is banned. But in Peru the regulations are much looser – you can even advertise near schools so long as the promotion is contained within the shop rather than outside it.

Argentina hasn’t claimed soccer’s crown since 1986 and Messi fell inches short in 2014 when they lost the final to Germany 1-0.

His determination has been clear as he and his side have warmed into the tournament perfectly despite being upset by Saudi Arabia in their first Group game.

They scrapped past the gutsy Socceroos in the Round of 16 before beating the Dutch on penalties.

However they were at their scary best in the semifinal blasting three goals past the stingy Croatian defence.

France have impressed throughout the competition scoring multiple goals in all but one match well and truly living up to the reigning champions tag.

Mbappe clubmate of Messi at PSG has been at the fore of the charge nabbing five goals to go with the four he netted in 2018 including one in the Final triumph over Croatia.

The French have not had it all their own way after dropping a game to Tunisia with a heavily rotated squad and having to answer bizarre questions around whether injured star Karim Benzema would be flown in for the final.

They got slightly lucky in the quarter-final against England with Harry Kane blowing a penalty but comfortably dispatched high flyers Morocco 2-0 in the semi.

Here Are 3 Top Stocks to Buy Now.,"Oil prices might be down but several catalysts could push crude higher in the coming year.

Crude oil prices started off the year red hot. Oil prices rallied from less than $80 a barrel to more than $125 a barrel following Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. However crude has cooled off considerably since this summer steadily falling back into the low $80s on macroeconomic concerns. That more than 20% plunge in crude oil prices means oil is in a bear market.

However a new bull market for oil looks to be coming next year. Here's why crude seems set to rebound which could fuel big gains for oil stocks.

Wall Street is very bullish on oil

Most oil market analysts believe oil prices are going much higher next year. For example Jeff Currie the global head of commodities for venerable investment bank Goldman Sachs has a $110 forecast for Brent oil (the global benchmark price) in 2023. Rival investment bank Morgan Stanley agrees expecting Brent to top the $110 a-barrel mark by the middle of next year. While others aren't quite as bullish the consensus is that oil prices will rebound in 2023.

Analysts note several catalysts that should fuel crude's rebound in 2023. Morgan Stanley summed it up in a note to clients. The bank wrote ""We remain constructive on oil prices driven by recovering demand (China reopening aviation recovering) amid constrained supply due to low levels of investment risks to Russia supply the end of SPR releases and slowdown of U.S. shale.""

The biggest catalyst is China. ""The pent-up demand out of China is going to be enormous"" according to comments by Energy Aspects director of research Amrita Sen in The Wall Street Journal. Sen believes ""that could swing demand by at least a million barrels a day and that could easily make the difference between an oil price forecast of $95 to $105 versus $120 to $130.""

Meanwhile most oil companies plan to continue keeping a relatively firm lid on investment spending and output. For example while oil giant Chevron (CVX 0.22%) plans to boost its capital budget by 25% next year to $17 billion most of that increase is due to inflation and a ramp in lower-carbon investment spending. Likewise even though ExxonMobil (XOM -0.41%) plans to boost capital spending from $22 billion this year to $23 billion-$25 billion in 2023 it expects its production will remain flat at around 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. With demand poised to rise amid continued tight supplies oil prices seem primed to rally.

A boon for oil stocks

This outlook for higher oil prices bodes well for oil companies in 2023. It will enable them to continue producing strong earnings and cash flow. Meanwhile with most oil companies limiting investment spending they'll have more money to return to their shareholders via buybacks and dividends.

Oil giants Chevron and ExxonMobil are well positioned to capitalize on higher crude oil prices next year. However three other producers stand out as even more compelling buys right now. One of them is Marathon Oil (MRO -2.21%). It trades at a bottom-of-the-barrel valuation compared to its peers (the higher the free cash flow (FCF) yield the lower the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio):

Because of that Marathon Oil has been using its oil-fueled windfall this year to gobble up its dirt cheap stock. The oil company has already retired 20% of its outstanding shares. It also used its oil-fueled cash flows to buy Ensign Natural Resources for $3 billion. That deal will boost its free cash flow by 15% assuming recent oil prices and by an even greater percentage if oil prices soar. That deal could give Marathon more fuel to buy back stock next year.

Diamondback Energy (FANG -0.75%) is another dirt cheap oil stock. That's a big reason it offers investors a high dividend yield which is currently over 6.5%. The other reason is its variable dividend strategy. What's noteworthy is that Diamondback has shifted its capital allocation strategy over the past quarter paying out a lower variable dividend so it can buy back more of its shares. The company could continue to pay a big-time dividend and gobble up more of its stock next year. It's in an even better position to capitalize on higher oil prices after recently agreeing to spend $3.3 billion to buy two cash-gushing oil companies. Those deals position it to produce even more free cash next year.

Finally analysts see a nearly 60% upside potential in Devon Energy (DVN -1.44%). They point to its strong balance sheet extensive drilling inventory and variable dividend framework. Another upside catalyst is that Devon recently closed two deals that it expects will boost its cash flow by 25% in the fourth quarter. Those acquisitions put it in an even better position to capitalize on higher oil prices next year.

High-upside oil stocks

Oil appears primed to rally sharply in 2023. While higher prices would benefit all oil stocks Marathon Diamondback and Devon stand out as best positioned to capitalize on higher crude prices. All three recently made cash-gushing acquisitions which could give them even more money to buy back their cheap stocks and pay dividends. That makes them the top oil stocks to buy heading into 2023.",,,,,,,,,

The former college golfer was only 14 years old the first time he won the PNC Championship with his father Bernhard. They won it again in 2019 matching the number of times Bernhard won the PNC with son Stefan (2005 2006).

Now Jason 22 is back with dad seeking a third title. The pair trail Justin and Mike Thomas by three strokes heading into Sunday’s final round. Tiger Woods and his son Charlie trail the Thomas’ by two. Should Team Woods win Charlie 13 would set a new tournament record.

“I didn’t want to expose him to this kind of pressure too early but he said ‘I’m ready. I can handle this’ ” said Bernhard “and he was right.”

Langer a two-time major champion has won 44 times on the PGA Tour Champions. The family rotates to see who gets to play with dad but after Jason hurt his back and couldn’t defend in 2020 his sister stepped in to compete.

Now it’s Bernhard who is feeling under the weather in Orlando battling a sore throat.

When asked what advice his dad gave him 6 years ago to compete under this kind of spotlight Jason echoed the thoughts of everyone this week – just enjoy the experience.

“I mean it’s such a cool tournament really unique” said Jason “and don’t get to be inside the ropes and hitting a golf ball with my dad too often.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGV0aW1lcy10cmlidW5lL25hbWUvZWxpemFiZXRoLW11bGhlcmluLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4NDMxMzQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elizabeth Mulherin Obituary (1935 - 2022) - Scranton PA - Scranton Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/thetimes-tribune/name/elizabeth-mulherin-obituary?id=38431343 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGV0aW1lcy10cmlidW5lL25hbWUvZWxpemFiZXRoLW11bGhlcmluLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4NDMxMzQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2Rkb3MtYXR0YWNrcy1hcmUtc2xvd2x5LWdyb3dpbmctaW4tdGhlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktZXJhL9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2FtcC9zdG9yeS9sYXRlc3QtbmV3cy9kZG9zLWF0dGFja3MtYXJlLXNsb3dseS1ncm93aW5nLWluLXRoZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWVyYQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DDoS Attacks are Slowly Growing in the Technology Era,Panix one of the oldest internet service providers was the first victim of DDoS attack that took place in 1996.

Sherman who founded generic drugmaker Apotex Inc in 1974. and his wife Honey were found dead in their Toronto mansion on December 15 2017.

The two were hanging by belts from a railing that surrounds their indoor pool and were in a semi-seated position on the pool deck.

'Closure will not be possible until those responsible for this evil act are brought to justice' son Jonathon Sherman said to CBC Toronto.

The family had earlier offered a $10-million reward for information leading to a conviction.

Barry Sherman 75 chairman of global drug giant Apotex and his wife Honey 70 were found dead in the basement pool area of their mansion in the leafy North York neighborhood on December 15 2017

Closure will not be possible until those responsible for this evil act are brought to justice' son Jonathon Sherman said on the fifth anniversary of his parents death upping the reward to $35m

'I have been overwhelmed with pain loss and sorrow and these feelings only continuously compound' Jonathon Sherman said.

'This immeasurable pain is felt every day when I realize that my own two children will never have the privilege of meeting my parents who made their lives possible for me and my husband.

'My parents deserved to enjoy the fruits of their labour and spend their twilight years as any grandparent should with their family. I continue to miss my parents more than I can describe and I am forever haunted by what happened to them' he added.

'Nothing will replace their incredible generosity and positive social impact. Their deaths have been a devastating loss for us all leaving a massive void in our hearts our lives and in our communities' he said.

Police told how the couple were found seated next to each other with ligatures pulled up around their necks and wrapped around a railing located by their pool

Last year Toronto police released video footage that saw images of a person walking on a sidewalk near the Shermans' home

In December 2021 police asked the public for help in identifying the suspect Price pointed out the individual's gait 'the way in which they kick up their right foot with every step.'

The billionaire family are now offering a $35 million rewards for information leading to an arrest (pictured the couple's children Jonathon Sherman and his sister Lauren during a 2017 memorial service in Mississauga Ontario)

Sherman 75 was known for his litigiousness and aggressive business practices as he developed Apotex which had a global work force of about 11000.

In 'Prescription Games' a 2001 book about the industry he mused that a rival might want to kill him.

Last year Toronto police released video footage that saw images of a person walking on a sidewalk near the Shermans' home.

Toronto Det. Sgt. Brandon Price said they have since largely eliminated everyone else picked up on security footage in the area adding that they have a great deal of confidence the suspect is linked to the scene.

Worth anywhere from $5 billion to $10 billion the couple was among Canada's most generous philanthropists and their deaths shocked Canadian high society and the country's Jewish community.

They made numerous multimillion-dollar donations to hospitals schools and charities and had buildings named in their honor. They hosted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a Liberal Party fundraiser in 2015.

'I think the kids are doing the right thing by continuing to keep this story alive the investigation alive and the pressure alive on law enforcement and the investigation' Avi Abraham Benlolo to CBC earlier this week.

Barry Sherman founded Apotex in 1974 and turned it into one of the largest generic drugmakers before stepping down as chief executive in 2012

The couple was among Canada's most generous philanthropists and their deaths shocked Canadian high society and the country's Jewish community

'Putting more money in place — perhaps it will provide the lead that is necessary. We really have a longing for closure' he said. 'We still don't feel that we have the answers that we need. What happened to them? Who's responsible? We need to bring them to justice.'

The day after the bodies were found some prominent news media outlets quoted unidentified police officials as saying the deaths appeared to be a murder-suicide.

Such declarations upset the couple's four adult children who then hired their own team of investigators and a pathologist who conducted second autopsies on the Shermans.

Police later said publicly they believed the Shermans were murdered.

Friends and family say the couple had been making plans for the future and had recently listed their home in Toronto for $5.3 million and were building a new home in the city.

Sherman faced legal action from cousins who said they had been cut out of the company over the years. A judge dismissed the claim just months before the couple was found dead.

Over 75% of the government colleges in Himachal Pradesh are functioning without a regular principal according to the general secretary of the state college teachers’ association.

Posts of regular principals are vacant in 119 out of 156 government colleges in the state while 75 colleges are functioning without their own building association general secretary R L Sharma said.

Two posts of principals designated as officers on special duty (OSD) at the directorate of higher education in Shimla are also lying vacant he said.

When contacted Director Higher Education Amarjeet Sharma said 25 appointments of principals would be made by the Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission.

“We are aware that majority of colleges are without a regular principal. All the documents are ready for conducting Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) but a case is pending in the court and we are waiting for the court orders to proceed with the DPC” he added.

Criticising the previous BJP government Sharma said “It is unfortunate that the state government and the Himachal Pradesh University were talking about the implementation of the National Education Policy without considering basic issues of faculty requirement and infrastructural facilities”.

At least 3000 more teachers would be required in the colleges to implement the multidisciplinary education system under the NEP 2020 he added.

There were 132 colleges in the state till March 2022 and 24 new colleges were opened in past eight months with an aim to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) which is one of the main features of the NEP from 26.3 percent to 50 percent by 2035 said college teachers.

About 75 percent principals are appointed through promotion and 25 percent are recruited directly. “We have appraised the new chief minister about the prevailing situation Sharma told PTI.

The newly opened colleges include Government Degree College (GDC) Ghandalwin Swarghat and Balh Seena in Bilaspur GDC Banikhet and Masroond in Chamba GDC Glore Lambloo in Hamirpur GDC Branda and Dharkandi Chadhiyar Kotla in Kangra GDC Chhatri and Pandoh Pangna in Mandi GDC Baruna and Chanddi Mamlig in Solan GDC Kupvi Jalog and Jeori in Shimla and GDC Satoun Narag and Nouradhar in Sirmaur and GDC Kaza in Lahaul and Spiti.

The Association said the DPC meeting for promotion for the post of principal (college cadre) has not been convened for over four years.

The last promotion of principals took place on July 10 2018 in which 23 teachers were promoted as regular principals while 20 teachers were placed on officiating basis.

After that no promotion was made and several teachers have superannuated without promotion association members lamented.

After recently taking over Chief Minister Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu has issued orders to de-notify the notifications for the creation and upgradation of institutions. He has said that educational institutions were opened and upgraded without making budget provisions.",,,,,,

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.



(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>>)



Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Guest Opinion

North Carolinians have extra reason to celebrate the new year in a few weeks. That’s because when the clock strikes midnight to mark the start of 2023 the Waterford Crystal ball in Times Square won't be the only thing to have dropped. So too will North Carolina’s flat income tax rate.

When 2023 arrives with it comes a new state income tax rate for North Carolinians and residents of four other states. North Carolina’s 4.99% personal income tax will fall to 4.75% on Jan. 1. While that reduction may sound modest to some it puts the state income tax rate — which is paid by most small businesses in addition to individuals and families — at almost 38% less than the top rate levied a decade ago.

At the start of 2013 North Carolina was home to the highest personal income tax rate in the southeastern U.S. with a top rate at the time of 7.75% and a corporate income tax of 6.9%. Thanks to the leadership of Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (R) Speaker Tim Moore (R) and his predecessor Senator Thom Tillis (R) by the end of 2026 North Carolina’s corporate income tax will completely phase out and the personal income tax rate is scheduled to go to 3.99%.

North Carolina’s income tax rates have fallen while the state’s population and congressional clout have risen. In making the tax code less burdensome and more competitive but doing so in a responsible manner that did not lead to budget shortfalls the changes enacted in North Carolina are seen by governors and lawmakers in other states as a model for pro-growth tax reform. Democratic politicians and progressive pundits have tried to portray Kansas and the flawed tax code changes enacted there as the epitome of conservative tax reform. But conservatives themselves have been pointing to North Carolina not Kansas as the model for how to do tax reform the right way.

Some states whose legislative leaders have followed North Carolina’s example over the past decade have since surpassed the Tar Heel State when it comes to income tax relief. Take Arizona a state that currently has a progressive income tax structure with a top rate of 4.5%. A new 2.5% flat income tax will take effect there on the first day of 2023.

In addition to Arizona and North Carolina residents of three other states will also receive an income tax cut on New Year’s Day. Idaho has a progressive income tax with a top rate of 6%. Thanks to legislation signed in September by Gov. Brad Little (R) a flat 5.8% income tax rate will take effect in January.

As part of a reform package Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) signed in March on Jan. 1 Iowa will go from having nine income tax brackets with a top rate of 8.53% to four brackets with a top rate of 6.5%. By 2026 Iowa will levy a flat 3.9% income tax. Meanwhile in Mississippi the 4% income tax bracket the lower of the state’s two brackets will be repealed on Jan. 1. That leaves Mississippi with a flat 5% income tax exempting the first $10000 in income.

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery so the saying goes. Since North Carolina lawmakers began reforming the state tax code almost 10 years ago many other states have been flattering North Carolina. With Arizona’s 2.5% rate taking effect which is now seen by many as the new target to aim for 2023 may be the year lawmakers in Raleigh begin to flatter their previous imitators.

LOS ANGELES Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- Starbucks workers from around 100 stores across the United States started a three-day strike on Friday making it the longest nationally coordinated job action in the company's history.

""Starting today over 1000 baristas are walking out on a THREE DAY STRIKE making this the longest collective action of our campaign yet"" tweeted the Starbucks Workers United (SBWU) which has won union elections at around 270 locations covering approximately 7000 baristas since December 2021 and organized the Friday's strike dubbed ""Double Down Strike.""

Collin Pollitt a union barista and SBWU organizer in Oklahoma City Oklahoma was quoted Friday by the In These Times an American politically progressive monthly magazine as saying that the reason to take the action is because of unfair labor practices of the the coffee giant including ""denial of credit card tipping to union stores hours cuts and the closing of union stores.""

SBWU demanded Starbucks begin negotiating a first contract and halt its union-busting campaign In These Times reported adding the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had cited the company with over 900 alleged violations of federal labor law since the union drive began.

In addition to going on strike the union also asked customers not to purchase Starbucks gift cards during the holiday season. The Union claimed that the company made a reported 212 million U.S. dollars from leftover money on gift cards in this fiscal year but had not been transparent on how it uses those funds.

Friday's strike was echoed by some American politicians.

Elizabeth Warren the senior U.S. senator from Massachusetts tweeted ""I stand in solidarity with Starbucks workers who are making their voices heard in Massachusetts and across the country.""

""We are standing with them across the country let's stop buying anything in Starbucks over three-day period"" Jamaal Bowman U.S. representative for New York's 16th congressional district said in a video posted online. ""Starbucks show your respect to your workers.""

SBWU previously organized a one-day national strike on Nov. 17 called the ""Red Cup Rebellion"" timed to coincide with the company's lucrative Red Cup Day annual promotion. But since then the union said Starbucks had continued to attack the organizing effort including by closing the first store to unionize in Seattle.

Starbucks is an American multinational chain of coffeehouses headquartered in Seattle Washington. As of November 2021 the company had 15444 stores in the United States. ■

“I feel like our consumers at least in Portland really get it that they need to shop small or we’re not going to be around” Field said.

So it’s confounding to her that the state’s leaders don’t seem to feel the same way. Local governments give away millions of dollars a year in the Portland area to Amazon and other big corporations to offset the cost of running warehouses.

“Amazon doesn’t need any tax breaks” Field said. “It’s one of the richest companies in the world.”

An analysis of local tax records by The Oregonian/OregonLive found Amazon has collected more than $15 million in property tax savings on its warehouses in the Portland area and Salem since 2019. Other warehousing and transportation companies have saved an additional $4 million.

The tax breaks come through incentives known as enterprise zones which offer property tax incentives to large employers. Warehouses in urban and suburban areas are eligible for tax incentives that last three to five years so long as they build in designated areas.

Watchdogs say the tax breaks for warehouses misunderstand the power dynamic with these businesses. Rather than attracting employers that might otherwise locate in another state or another country they say Oregon is offering giveaways to warehouses that couldn’t go anywhere else for the simple reason that they need to be close to their customers.

The enterprise zone program expires in 2025. If lawmakers want to continue offering those incentives in the future they need to renew it in advance most likely during the legislative session that begins next month.

To small retailers like Field tax breaks for their biggest competitors feel like a perverse application of Oregon’s economic incentive programs. She and other small business owners say the state is giving away tax dollars that could be spent on public services or to help local businesses pay benefits to their employees.

“Why do we continue to feel like we have to continue to give tax breaks to these big companies?” she asks. “Why do we continue to support ‘big is better’ when there are a lot more small businesses out there that could use this help?”

Oregon tax watchdogs — and some legislators — are asking the same questions.

Reformers want to see the warehouse tax breaks eliminated as part of a package of changes they have proposed for the upcoming legislative session. They argue that big companies like Amazon have a strong incentive to operate in Oregon even without public assistance.

“I’m not totally sure we should be subsidizing their decisions when they’re competing against brick-and-mortar stores that aren’t getting the tax break” Rep. Khanh Pham D-Portland said at a legislative hearing earlier this fall.

‘ENTERPRISE ZONE’ GOALS

Oregon established enterprise zones in the 1980s envisioning the program as a way to attract factory jobs to rural areas and blighted urban centers. Lawmakers gradually expanded the program to offer longer tax breaks in a broader range of circumstances — and in far more places.

Large tech companies now dominate the program saving more than $150 million a year in taxes for giant data centers in central and eastern Oregon an industry that didn’t even exist when the state created the enterprise zone incentives nearly 40 years ago.

Online shopping didn’t exist either but today it’s a nearly $1 trillion industry.

Amazon surrounds nearly every major U.S. city with a ring of warehouses to ensure products are quickly available whenever someone orders them online and FedEx UPS and others have rapidly expanded their own operations to be closer to their customers.

In Oregon as in other states they’ve done it with financial help from the government.

Amazon’s $180 million Troutdale warehouse for example occupies 74 acres of industrial land formerly home to a Reynolds and Alcoa aluminum smelter. Local officials promised the company tax breaks worth an estimated $10 million.

Next door FedEx occupies a 450000-square-foot distribution center built more than a decade ago with the promise of millions more in tax breaks. In 2010 local officials hailed its pending arrival as an “an engine for economic investment not just for Troutdale but all of East Multnomah County.”

FedEx and Amazon together employ more than 2000 in Troutdale a Portland suburb of just 16000 people. The tax breaks last just three to five years so they are each becoming major taxpayers as their incentives expire.

CLOSE TO CUSTOMERS

Whatever economic benefits the warehouses provide Oregon the tax incentives were unnecessary to bring them to Oregon says Jody Wiser of the watchdog group Tax Fairness Oregon.

Manufacturers could arguably choose to put their factories anywhere in the world and sometimes might be swayed by a big tax incentive.

But Amazon and package delivery companies can’t put their local shipping warehouses in a far-flung state. Even locating their facilities just across the Columbia River in Clark County might be unpalatable because the region’s two major interstate bridges are frequently congested.

“For warehouses it’s the distribution pattern” that is the deciding factor Wiser said. “Where are their customers and how can they most efficiently get those goods to their customers?”

Rather than luring businesses from other states Wiser said the warehouse tax breaks essentially pit Oregon cities and counties against one another to offer the biggest incentives.

“It’s about our own people competing against each other” Wiser said.

Many other states offer warehouse tax breaks too.

A study by Good Jobs First a liberal think tank that promotes government accountability calculates Amazon has received more than $2 billion to date for its warehouses. In Oregon it values the company’s distribution center tax breaks at more than $28 million since 2015.

What happens if a community refuses to hand over the tax breaks? Sometimes the companies build anyway.

Robert Carney president of the Woodburn City Council said Amazon approached the city last year with a proposal to build a huge distribution center on land recently brought into Woodburn’s urban growth boundary. He said the company wanted enterprise zone incentives for the project.

“We basically said ‘We don’t think this is the kind of program for a firm like you. You’re big. You’ve got money’” Carney said. He said Woodburn believed Amazon was choosing the site because of its convenient location just off Interstate 5 about 30 miles south of Portland.

“We only offer such program benefits to a firm if acquiring it is relevant to them and it actually makes a difference in their location choice” Carney said. “We did not believe this to be the case with Amazon.”

Spurned by Woodburn Carney said Amazon hemmed and hawed but didn’t walk away. The company went ahead with construction of one of the largest buildings in the state — a five-story 3.8-million-square-foot warehouse.

‘WHAT’S A GOOD JOB?’

At the September legislative hearing on Oregon tax incentives Rep. Pham noted that the economy has changed dramatically since the state created the enterprise zone program.

“I’m concerned that a lot of our small businesses are competing with these big companies like Amazon” Pham said. “What changes could be made to address these new kinds of businesses?”

Art Fish the state’s incentives coordinator appeared flummoxed.

“You raise a good question” he said adding that the acknowledgement was “about the best I can offer at this point.”

In an interview last month Business Oregon the state’s economic development agency touted the flexibility of the enterprise zone program. Nathan Buehler the agency’s spokesperson said it allows local governments to set their own rules for who qualifies based on employment wages and the size of their tax breaks.

“Excluding one type of business from the incentive may make excellent economic sense for some communities” Buehler wrote “but with a statewide exclusion it may prevent others from taking advantage of business opportunities on property where there is little development interest from other sectors.”

It’s not clear though how much consideration local governments give to the types of businesses that capitalize on these tax breaks. The incentives are sometimes available to projects that are unpopular among their neighbors.

Hillsboro residents for example fought unsuccessfully last year to block Amazon from opening warehouses in an enterprise zone near residential areas.

Portland officials say they are helpless to stop a developer called Prologis from building a warehouse in a shuttered Kmart located in an enterprise zone in east Portland near Parkrose High School. Neighbors say it will add pollution and traffic to a residential area but because it meets zoning codes and enterprise zone qualifications the San Francisco company appears free to proceed and its warehouse tenants will be eligible to collect the tax incentives.

“It’s a debate the value of the warehousing e-commerce space that we’ve had for a number of years” said Andy Reed a project manager who leads enterprise zone work for Prosper Portland the city’s economic development agency.

Portland awarded Amazon and other warehousing companies tax breaks worth more than $1.4 million last year and they stand to save millions of dollars more in the years ahead.

“It gets to the question of what’s a good job? And are they creating enough jobs for the value of the incentive?” Reed said.

Warehouses aren’t likely to choose another jurisdiction if they don’t get a Portland tax incentive Reed said acknowledging that they need to be close to their customers. But he said warehouses do have economic value noting that wages and employment have surged since the pandemic began.

Transportation and warehousing employment jumped by more than 10% from 2019 to 2021 a period when most industries were cutting jobs according to the Oregon Employment Department. The sector’s average wage climbed by 9% during that period.

While there’s no evidence tax breaks had anything to do with those increases Reed said the incentives do give Portland leverage with employers. He said Prosper Portland uses them to encourage businesses to participate in the city’s diversity and inclusion programs.

So while Portland can’t withhold tax breaks from Prologis’ project because it’s building inside a designated enterprise zone Reed said the city will set conditions on the incentives. Depending on the size of its investment Prologis may have to allocate 3% of its tax savings for minority-owned businesses pay wages above the state minimum offer internships to students from marginalized communities and work with a diverse array of suppliers.

Amazon doesn’t face the same requirements because its tax incentives predate Prosper Portland’s diversity initiatives. But the city says it worked with Amazon to seek contracting firms owned by minorities and women it directed Amazon to local transit programs and it helped the company with local employee recruitment.

The enterprise zone’s pending expiration represents a good opportunity to revisit the program Reed said and for the Legislature to evaluate how to ensure the incentives are still meeting Oregon’s goals.

“I think it’s a really good story to talk about the 2025 expiration. It feels like this is a really important conversation” he said.

Portland hasn’t taken a position on whether the Legislature should make warehouses ineligible for enterprise zone tax breaks.

“That’s why we have lawmakers to make these calls for us” Reed said. “This really isn’t our decision to say one way or another whether a warehouse is more important than a food processor.”

Amazon’s biggest warehouse tax breaks are for its mammoth 855000-square-foot Troutdale warehouse. The company has received incentives worth $8.7 million for that facility in just the past three years.

Marlee Boxler Troutdale’s economic development director said last month that she was too busy to respond immediately to questions about Amazon’s incentives. She didn’t reply to subsequent inquiries this month.

Asked for comment on its incentives Amazon issued a brief statement: “These programs are designed to support investment and are available to any company committing the same amount of investment.”

The company declined to say how many people its warehouses employ writing instead that it employs nearly 13000 people in various jobs across Oregon. (In addition to its warehouses around Portland and Salem Amazon has a network of data centers in eastern Oregon and an engineering office in downtown Portland.)

‘IT DOESN’T SOUND FAIR’

Rather than offer tax breaks to warehouses some communities are putting the brakes on new warehouse development. On Monday the Vancouver City Council enacted a six-month moratorium on new warehouses. The council said the large warehouses typically employ relatively few people and the traffic they generate may be in conflict with Vancouver’s climate goals.

“The increase in the growth of e-commerce and the increasing trend toward larger and larger distribution facilities is concerning particularly since these facilities consume vast quantities of limited industrially zoned land” Chad Eiken the city’s director of community development said in a written statement. “The moratorium will allow for concerns related to long-term impacts from mega-warehouses to be studied better understood and addressed as needed.”

Big companies are capitalizing on tax breaks that were written for another era according to Sarah Shaoul who runs the Portland small-business advocacy organization Bricks Need Mortar. She said it’s heartening that the Legislature is re-evaluating the enterprise zone program.

“When you see things like this that have been on the books for 40 years industry knows how to take advantage of these things and does” Shaoul said.

Instead of underwriting big warehouses she said she would like to see some of the tax savings Oregon now offers to big companies diverted instead to local retailers to help them pay for employees’ health care transportation and housing.

“It’s easy to pick on Amazon but Amazon’s been preying on our small business community from the get-go” Shaoul said. “So there’s no need to offer them any incentives whatsoever.”

Bridgid Blackburn says her import shop Cargo has been buffeted by the pandemic rising labor costs crime near her Southeast Portland location and competition from big retailers like Amazon and Walmart that carry similar products.

“The overall feeling in retail and restaurant especially in Portland right now is the city and state has turned its back on small business” Blackburn laments. “That we don’t have the same playing field. That our voice isn’t being heard.”

It simply doesn’t make sense she said that Portland and Oregon are giving away millions of dollars to support a big competitor from out of state.

“That assortment of benefits none of that is available to the small retailer” Blackburn said. She said small stores encourage people to do more business within the city and spent their money locally. She said she’s looked for public programs that could support Cargo but hasn’t found anything and she can’t understand why Oregon reserves its biggest giveaways for large corporations.

“It doesn’t sound fair to me at all” Blackburn said.

Correction: The tax incentives for Prologis’ warehouse in east Portland accrue to the company’s tenants not Prologis directly as the article originally indicated.

Finding the right one for you will likely have a profound impact on your financial future. Luckily these experts are here to help.

Edited by John Bruno Turiano and Nick Brandi

We didn’t need World Population Review to tell us that Westchester is one of the richest communities in the U.S. Yet as of this year that same demographics research company placed nine Westchester County towns among the top 100 richest towns in America — more than any other county in the U.S. With all that accumulated wealth it follows that Westchester would attract some of the most experienced and talented wealth advisors to be found anywhere. But isolating the best of the best is no mean feat so WM hired data-research company DataJoe to conduct an exhaustive multitiered survey to determine and document the county’s top 314 wealth managers.

The standard which sets a limit of 2% on crypto reserves among banks must be implemented on Jan. 1 2025 according to an official announcement on Dec. 16.

The report dubbed “Prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures” introduces the final standard structure for banks regarding exposure to digital assets including tokenized traditional assets stablecoins and unbacked cryptocurrencies as well as feedback from stakeholders collected in a consultation launched in June. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision noted the report will soon be incorporated as a new chapter into the consolidated Basel Framework.

BIS's announcement highlights that the global banking system's direct exposure to digital assets remains relatively low but recent developments have outlined ""the importance of having a strong minimum framework for internationally active banks to mitigate risks."" It also stated:

“Unbacked cryptoassets and stablecoins with ineffective stabilisation mechanisms will be subject to a conservative prudential treatment. The standard will provide a robust and prudent global regulatory framework for internationally active banks' exposures to cryptoassets that promotes responsible innovation while preserving financial stability.”

Pablo Hernández de Cos chair of the Basel Committee and Governor of the Bank of Spain noted about the standard:

“The Committee’s standard on cryptoasset is a further example of our commitment willingness and ability to act in a globally coordinated way to mitigate emerging financial stability risks. The Committee’s work programme for 2023–24 endorsed by GHOS today seeks to further strengthen the regulation supervision and practices of banks worldwide. In particular it focuses on emerging risks digitalisation climate-related financial risks and monitoring and implementing Basel III.”

The BIS disclosed in September the results of its multi-jurisdictional central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot following a month-long testing phase that enabled cross-border transactions worth $22 million. The pilot program involved the central banks of Hong Kong Thailand China and the United Arab Emirates as well as 20 commercial banks from those regions. According to a report by the BIS published in June around 90% of central banks are considering the adoption of CBDCs.",,,,,,,,,

With a current population of over 4.6 million a 1.48 percent increase from 2021 the Phoenix metro is packed with abundant job growth consumer spending and investment opportunities. Throughout the U.S. Phoenix had the largest absolute increase in population growth between 2010 and 2020 and reported the fastest growth rate among America’s biggest cities according to the New York Times. Beyond impressive population stats Phoenix also boasts a business-friendly environment with limited government interference and low taxes. Lastly the Valley offers sprawling submarkets at reasonable prices. Suburbs like Buckeye grew 80 percent in ten years and provide development opportunities not seen in dense coastal markets. In all Phoenix has become a treasure for commercial real estate investors but with great success comes great challenges. As the aftereffects of COVID-19 become clear and sectors begin to shift investors will need to evaluate where in the Valley to plant capital what type of products best suit their needs and what economic and consumer trends Phoenix is experiencing. Here is a look at the 2023 Phoenix commercial real estate outlook and opportunities.

The Multifamily Market

2020 spurred historical growth for Phoenix’s multifamily market that continued into 2021 and early 2022. The influx of movers into Phoenix caused a massive shift in demand for multi-housing properties forcing developers to ramp up new supply quickly. But now in late 2022 the absorption rate is moderating and supply is still accelerating causing the metro’s vacancy rate to reach 7.9 percent a two percent increase from Q1 2022. Around the summer of 2021 Phoenix averaged 15 to 20 transactions per week with fewer properties available. As of September 2022 Phoenix is averaging one to four transactions and five to 10 new properties entering the market per week. The development pipeline specifically for luxury units is heavily outpacing demand as renters seek more affordable smaller units to combat rising living costs. Although still impressive the market’s current rent growth of 12 percent is much lower than the market’s rate of 27 percent in early 2022; most likely a result of slowing demand and lower lease renewal rates.

Investment Opportunities

With high vacancy rates slowing rent growth and overwhelming supply Phoenix multifamily investors may be looking at a game of “hot potato.” Certain assets could hold dangerous consequences and cause trouble for owners as demand stalls and renter expectations change.

Investors are striving to find first-generation value-add deals which are few and far between as 1361 properties have traded over the last five years representing 36 percent of the market. The biggest opportunity for investors will be re-strategizing and adding value to operations rather than adding extensive interior and exterior renovations. Investors should focus on improving the bottom-line net operating income whether that be turning the rent roll or re-capturing market rents. Other ways to increase the bottom line include adding other income-producing initiatives such as parking pet rent or laundry while simultaneously focusing on cutting down ownership expenses. During uncertain markets improving existing properties will ultimately create the most value for multifamily investors.

2023 commercial real estate outlook: Industrial

By John Stroud

Two main components can be attributed to Phoenix industrial’s monumental performance over the last two years rent growth and low supply. With out-of-state investors flooding the Valley and delayed development timelines buyers and tenants are being forced to pay premium pricing on industrial properties. As of August 2022 the asset class’s annual rent growth rate was 16.5 percent much higher than the national average. Market sale price per square foot also accelerated reaching $168 a 19 percent increase year-over-year.

Another attribute of industrial’s performance is its diversification of property types and reach across industries. Warehouse and manufacturing space proved to be pivotal during the pandemic but the lack of supply caused almost all industrial properties to increase in value. Tenants began adapting to the market leasing spaces previously deemed unsuitable because the options were limited.

Rising construction costs labor shortages and rising interest rates are all affecting commercial real estate development but Phoenix industrial is still strong and outlook remains positive.

As more facilities are built around the Valley land constraints have appeared. In-demand neighborhoods like Scottsdale Airpark an 8.6 square mile area with over 2900 businesses have little land left to develop a problem that was nowhere near fruition a few years ago. Phoenix also saw a shift in building sizes as large Fortune 500 companies started moving into the market. To accommodate the influx developers focused on producing big-box industrial properties and scaling back on smaller facilities. Once again the lack of availability has pushed pricing up and small industrial properties are going for top dollar. In addition land constraints have spurred developers to look into repurposing existing structures as new builds become more expensive and regulated.

Investment Opportunities

The biggest obstacle facing Phoenix industrial investors is rising prices and the rat race of competitive offers coming in across all product types. Arizona gained popularity due to its affordability compared to nearby coastal markets but with the current lack of supply and unbalanced demand that pricing gap is narrowing. Investors should consider growing submarkets like North Phoenix and the East and West Valley to obtain assets at a lower price per square foot with a potential upside. However the further out the greater risk as some regions bring fluctuating vacancy and less leasing demand. Another point to keep in mind while investing in Phoenix industrial is the amount of supply waiting to enter the market is higher than the majority of the country which potentially could limit an owner’s leverage to raise rents once vacancy heightens.

The Self-Storage Market

By Ben Tracy

The self-storage asset class climbed the ranks rapidly at the start of the pandemic and has continued its dominance throughout the U.S. Phoenix boasts one of the most vital self-storage pipelines; with 13.3 percent of existing inventory underway making it a top five metro for development in the nation. Self-storage rates have remained high although operators are predicting an increase in move-outs in the second half of 2022 as workers return to offices and the Phoenix housing market slows. However the average length of stay for renters has increased helping owners secure stable and lucrative income. According to Yardi Matrix total revenue for self-storage products is increasing by double-digit percentages nationally.

Investment Opportunities

As with any real estate the most crucial factor self-storage investors should consider when it comes to the 2023 commercial real estate outlook is location location location. Phoenix is seeing a slight shift in consumer trends but still offers plenty of valuable opportunities within the storage market. Single-story facilities with larger units see longer-term tenancy and strong demand throughout the Valley. These types of properties are comparable in strength to three-story Class A climate-controlled facilities. Phoenix is also a thriving market for boat and RV storage facilities. With most of the new housing being in HOA communities homeowners need a place to store recreational vehicles and boats due to the strict storage and parking policies in regulated communities.

The Retail Market

By Alex DeSoto

The thriving local job economy combined with the market’s population growth has helped Phoenix’s retail sector quickly recover from the impact of COVID-19 and increase its popularity among investors. Leasing volume is substantial with 4.4 million square feet absorbed within the last 12 months according to CoStar. Smaller niche tenants are performing well and rapidly growing. Boutique gyms such as F45 or popular local coffee joints like Dutch Bros and Black Rock Coffee are storming the Valley and offer investors a smaller retail footprint solution. Rents are steadily increasing and are above the national average as Phoenix’s same-store asking rents increased 7.1 percent year-over-year while the U.S. average increase is 4.3 percent.

Investors are entering the market as new development and redevelopment projects pop up across the region especially in growing submarkets. One of the largest retail redevelopments PV a mixed-use complex set to complete its first phase by 2024 is in North Phoenix and will offer a 400-unit multifamily building in addition to various retail fronts hospitality and entertainment venues. With growing opportunities and increased competition pricing has increased reaching an average of $250 per square foot.

Investment Opportunities

Phoenix’s tremendous rent growth has driven values well beyond what most experts had predicted. Fortunately continued growth is expected as the population and retail demand continue to increase meaning investors should look to take advantage of the market conditions.

When it comes to the 2023 commercial real estate outlook it’s important to keep in mind the majority of tenants in Phoenix are food and beverage meaning the product type is performing well but could become oversaturated. Overall consumers are craving a more personal and experiential shopping dining and workout experience which means some brands will cater to new generations better than others. Boutique fitness facilities quick-service restaurants and technology-savvy retailers will continue to gain popularity and offer a secure and profitable business model for investors.

Phoenix commercial real estate is healthy and bountiful but is shifting as it nears late 2022. It is essential that investors work with a specialized and knowledgeable agent to understand what product types fit long-term financial management and portfolio goals in addition to what parts of the Valley present thriving opportunities.

The Atlanta-based company which is one of the largest homebuilders in the nation announced Friday that it had fired Brandon Jones a PulteGroup senior vice president who was set to start as chief operating officer in January following an investigation that concluded he had violated the company’s code of ethics the outlet reported.

On Wednesday Bill Pulte the grandson of the company’s founder sued Jones — but not the company — alleging that Jones created several Twitter accounts under fake identities and ran a bot network to harass defame and stalk Pulte and his family members.

The harassment campaign according to the 129-page complaint (with exhibits) included unsubstantiated allegations that Pulte’s father Mark Pulte was responsible for a fire that burned down a country club in a Detroit suburb last winter.

Jones the lawsuit alleges sometimes used at least two fake accounts simultaneously to give the appearance of an ongoing dialogue. He sometimes carried out his harassment campaign while on company time with company equipment the lawsuit alleges.

Jones allegedly carried a grudge against Bill Pulte because Pulte while he was on PulteGroup’s board of directors from 2016 to 2020 opposed Jones’ promotion to COO according to the lawsuit. Jones was ultimately promoted to COO — with Pulte no longer on the board — in October and was set to start in that role in January.

Bill Pulte has 3.2 million followers on Twitter and is known for frequently giving money to various causes and individuals in need.

“My grandfather spent 68 years of his life making sure the company was secure so I view this as a spiritual mission” Pulte told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

“I love this company and the majority of the employees are awesome. But I think you have the potential of some rogue executives that maybe convinced themselves that the rules didn’t apply to them.”

The lawsuit filed in Florida federal court seeks monetary damages of up to $75000.

In a statement to the Journal Constitution Jones’ attorney Mark Raymond said the lawsuit contains “many falsehoods and inaccuracies.”

PulteGroup which is the third-largest homebuilder in the U.S. recently bought 80 lots at Avenir in Palm Beach Gardens Florida for $8 million and paid another $6.9 million for a 6.7-acre development site in Plantation with plans to build an 86-unit townhouse project.

Blockchains founder and CEO Jeffrey Berns and his wife Mary Berns listed a pair of adjacent properties they own on the Lake Tahoe waterfront for a combined $45 million the Wall Street Journal reported. The homes can also be bought separately for $40 million and $7 million respectively the outlet reported.

Clif Chase of Chase International Luxury Real Estate has the listing.

Jeffrey Berns a longtime consumer protection attorney founded Blockchains in 2014 to focus on Web3 services. He gained notoriety in 2018 when he bought a plot of land near Reno Nevada for $170 million to build a futuristic blockchain-centric “utopia.”

Berns bought the lakefront mansion at 1180 Highway 50 in Glenbrook on the Nevada side of the lake for $23.5 million in 2018 according to the outlet. The 1.6-acre property includes a 9300-square-foot six-bedroom main house a two-bedroom guest house and a beach cabana the listing shows. The estate spans 160 feet of lakefront with a dock private pier and jet ski dock.

Berns bought the smaller home next door for guest use he told the outlet. The 3000-square-foot five-bedroom home sits on 0.3 acres and spans 76 feet of lakefront.

Jeffrey and Mary Berns were revealed as the buyers of a lakefront mansion in Incline Village for $47.5 million in May. The purchase is the third-highest residential price ever in Lake Tahoe.

They closed on the Nevada-side property in November last year and have been living there full time since then. Berns told the Wall Street Journal his family moved to be closer to his daughter’s school.

The bankers of Wall Street have the Hamptons and the tech founders of Silicon Valley have Lake Tahoe. The mountain community just a four-hour drive from the heart of the tech world saw a boom during the pandemic that shot home prices to unparalleled levels.

The lake straddles the boundary between California and Nevada offering a convenient tax haven for wealthy California residents with vacation homes on the other side of the border.

It was widely reported last year that billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison bought four Incline Village homes between $15 million and $20 million each. The tech founder is an avid real estate investor and also purchased a waterfront Hyatt resort for $345 million last year. Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan bought a pair of adjacent Lake Tahoe compounds for $59 million on the California side of the border in Tahoe City according to several outlets.

We also had a chance to run some benchmarks on development handsets Qualcomm and its partners use to build software (see photo above).

Such handsets are typically called MDP (mobile development platform) and are not explicitly designed for benchmarks. Still based on our experience they provide a relatable performance proxy for upcoming high-end phones.

We looked at the CPU and Graphics performance using well-known benchmarks such as Geekbench and GFXBench but other benchmarks results mostly correlate with these two regarding CPU and GPU speed.

We’re trying to see where the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 pushes the envelope as seen by most consumers and CPU + Graphics are an excellent performance indicator. Should you care about benchmarks? Yes but only to a point.

The data we’ll publish below includes AI (artificial-related) benchmarks. They are pretty interesting to look at if you’re into this. However AI benefits are not yet directly reflected by AI benchmarks. While we are interested in such benchmarks we aren’t using them yet in our mobile phone recommendations.

The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra represents last year’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 platform which dominated the high-end market. The OnePlus 10T features the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 a slightly faster version of the original Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.

The Geekbench 5 single-threaded only uses the fastest CPU core and shows a great deal of performance increase over the last-generation platform.

More importantly when all cores are pushed to their limit the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 does much better than its predecessor by a good margin and this should show up in any app which requires massive CPU computing.

During daily usage such CPU performance translates into faster app initialization or shorter wait times for many different tasks. Many people say the difference is not apparent but all you need to do is use a one or two-year-old phone to feel it right sway. It’s much easier to adopt new tech.

It’s worth noting that Apple’s A15 Bionic and A16 Bionic remain ahead in this particular benchmark although the gap is reduced compared to previous years.

The graphics performance of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is also impressive and features a considerable boost in benchmarks. Using the excellent OnePlus 10T as a gaming reference phone you can see how much faster Qualcomm’s new platform is.

Sure you might not want to play at 200 FPS but the chip can handle the most complex games available to mobiles including some that use advanced features such as raytraced reflections and shadows. That’s a more critical byproduct of higher performance than just higher FPS.

The performance jump is even more significant in the latest graphics benchmarks such as GFXBench Aztec Ruins (Vulkan/Metal offscreen).

In graphics benchmarks such as GFXBench Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 dominates its Apple A15 and A16 counterparts which indicates that Qualcomm’s GPU designs and drivers are incredibly advanced.

That’s also true even when using benchmarks that naturally favor Apple like GFXBench Manhattan 3.1 OpenGL (android) vs. Metal (iPhone). The Metal graphics API is best compared to Vulkan on Android. It features lower driver CPU overhead and tends to score higher than OpenGL. Yet Qualcomm still wins.

Regarding neural processing or artificial intelligence (AI) the new Snapdragon platform scores higher by up to 25% depending on the benchmark you’re looking at. None of them are perfect but comparing something like MLPerf across two generations of chips does provide a good indication.

Again most AI workloads are not sustained and things like voice commands face detection or photography happen now and then. Things get more interesting with video as AI is potentially solicited much more perhaps between 20 and 60 times per second.

In any case it’s difficult for users to “get things done faster” if recording video and the AI is used to blur the background for example. It’s more challenging to put a productivity number on these things.

In conclusion the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 platform is just as good as we hoped. The graphics performance gains are worth nothing and bode well for upcoming gaming and XR applications.

Benchmarks still don’t measure including the brilliant links between the image processor and the neural processor but we also don’t need to make this more complicated than it already is. Just read our Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 feature overview to better understand these critical details.

We’re looking forward to using commercial phones equipped with this SoC and reporting on how they perform.

Motorola and Lenovo's First Collaboration

According to Android Central this will be the first collaboration between the parent and offspring company since its acquisition years ago. And while it did not focus on tablets and computers Moto's strength is with smartphones one that features excellent performance and capabilities for multiple needs in business personal and gaming.

Motorola Smartphones

Motorola has multiple smartphone releases in the present and the company has not stopped ever since its return to the market now fully immersed in modern technology requirements and standards.

One of the most notable things about Moto's releases is that it centers on Google's Android to run its smartphones leaving behind its self-made OS from the past.

While Moto was famous for its standard screen smartphone releases that equipped the Android OS its most famous product to date is still its RAZR foldable smartphone that rivals that of Samsung's Galaxy ZFlip series.

These two companies are still the world leaders in foldable devices with regular annual releases of their latest offers to the public.

Lenovo acquired Motorola from Google but both companies have worked independently for the longest time with the public not seeing any collaborative efforts on different tech devices until now.

The ThinkPhone will be the ultimate multipurpose smartphone from Moto should it release to the public with the industry-leading specs on its sheet.

A ThinkPad-style Motorola phone may have been leaked.

Dubbed the Motorola ThinkPhone the handset apparently features a fake carbon-fiber finish that's reminiscent of Lenovo’s ThinkPad laptops.

It will supposedly be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset among other specs.

Even though Lenovo acquired Motorola from Google a few years ago the two companies have since operated separately. However we might see Lenovo's marquee branding for its laptops cross over to a Motorola phone in the future as per a new leak.

Motorola is reportedly working on a handset with the same faux carbon-fiber finish as Lenovo's ThinkPad line of laptops according to leaked images shared by The Tech Outlook (via Android Police). The ThinkPhone prototype even has the same font style as the ThinkPad line.

This is the first time we've seen this new type of Motorola handset though it doesn't come as a huge surprise given Motorola's relationship with Lenovo. While the leaked images appear blurry we can glimpse some sort of integration between the ThinkPhone and Lenovo's ThinkPad line.

It is uncertain which market segment the device is aiming for but the specs sheet that came with the leak may give it away. According to it the phone will be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset like the Motorola Edge 30 Ultra. It will apparently be paired with up to 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of internal storage. These specs indicate that this new type of Motorola handset will be business-oriented at the very least.

It has some of the hallmark features of the ThinkPad brand in addition to the styling and faux carbon fiber finish. For example there's a red button at the upper left corner which could be a customizable shortcut button. It reminds us of the ThinkPad's TrackPoint center button though their functions vary.

Aside from the chipset and ThinkPad styling the leak tells us that this device will sport a 6.6-inch OLED display with a 1800 x 2400 resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate. On the back there's likely a triple camera setup consisting of a 50MP main sensor a 13MP ultrawide shooter and a 2MP depth sensor.

It will also supposedly pack a 5000mAh battery with 68W fast-charging capability which should be enough to get the device through at least a full day of use without the need for a charger.

Finding the right one for you will likely have a profound impact on your financial future. Luckily these experts are here to help.

Edited by John Bruno Turiano and Nick Brandi

We didn’t need World Population Review to tell us that Westchester is one of the richest communities in the U.S. Yet as of this year that same demographics research company placed nine Westchester County towns among the top 100 richest towns in America — more than any other county in the U.S. With all that accumulated wealth it follows that Westchester would attract some of the most experienced and talented wealth advisors to be found anywhere. But isolating the best of the best is no mean feat so WM hired data-research company DataJoe to conduct an exhaustive multitiered survey to determine and document the county’s top 314 wealth managers.

Brady 45 and the Bucs are coming off a brutal loss to the San Francisco 49ers. The Bengals meanwhile are riding a five-game winning streak.

Tom Brady joke has press room cracking up after Bucs win over the Saints @Buccaneers

Burrow 26 will be facing Brady for the first time in his career. While the young QB doesn't listen to comparisons with the veteran it's nearly impossible not to find similarities.

TB12 won his first Super Bowl in his second NFL season while Burrow got to the championship game as a sophomore in the league.

This game is critical for Tampa Bay to stay alive in its postseason run. Brady and company are leading the NFC South by the smallest of margins.

How to listen where to watch on TV & live stream

Kickoff from Raymond James Stadium is scheduled for 16:25 ET on Saturday.

The national broadcast will air on CBS but it's not the only way to follow the action.

Cincinnati locals can listen to the game on Bengals Radio Network led by flagship stations WLW-AM (700) WCKY-AM (1530) and WEBN-FM (102.7).

Tampa residents can listen on the Bucs' flagship station 98ROCK.

Fans seeking to stream the game live need a subscription to NFL+ or for another streaming platform such as fuboTV.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbmZsL25mbC13b3JsZC1zaG9ja2VkLWJ5LXRlYW1zLXZpc2l0aW5nLWxvY2tlci1yb29tLXNldHVw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NFL World Shocked By Team's Visiting Locker Room Setup,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbmZsL25mbC13b3JsZC1zaG9ja2VkLWJ5LXRlYW1zLXZpc2l0aW5nLWxvY2tlci1yb29tLXNldHVw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D821C3FD0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The RTX 4080 is an excellent GPU but like all high end cards it's too expensive at this point in time.

PC Gamer's got your back Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.

If you read our review of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition our conclusion was that it's an excellent graphics card marred by an excessive price. The FE's $1200 / £1269 / AU$2219 price is simply beyond the range of mainstream gamers and that's before considering the premium tier partner cards that cost even more. Consoles look appealing to many.

But now that the Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX have launched hopefully those prices are set to trend downwards. Probably not by a lot but at least they're heading in the right direction. Thank god miners aren't competing this time around.

The Zotac GeForce RTX 4080 Amp Extreme Airo is a long name for a big (and curvy!) card. It aims to beat out the Founders Edition in every aspect purporting to be faster quieter cooler and more feature rich than the FE. At $1399 / £1319 / AU$2349 it's a step up in price—though unusually that's most apparent in the USA—costing $199 more than the launch price of the FE. In the UK and Australia the pricing of the Zotac is more fair at £50 or AU$130 more than the FE.

The Zotac Airo like all other RTX 4080s is built around the 4nm AD103 GPU which has 9728 out of a possible 10240 cores available. That leaves room for Nvidia to release an RTX 4080 Ti in the future. The AD103 gets a huge increase in L2 cache size at 64MB vs the 5MB of the RTX 3080. Add to that much improved ray tracing support the impressive DLSS 3 and a more than reasonable 320W TDP and spec wise the RTX 4080 looks very strong.

RTX 4080 AMP Extreme Airo specs (Image credit: Zotac) GPU: Nvidia AD103-300-A1

Shader Units: 9728

Boost clock speed: 2565MHz

Memory capacity: 16GB GDDR6X

Memory speed: 22.4Gbps

Outputs: 3x DisplayPort 1.4a 1x HDMI 2.1

Power connectors: 1x 16-pin

Price: $1399| £1319 | AU$2349

Other key specs include 16GB of 22.4Gbps GDDR6X memory over a 256-bit bus. That's a step back from the RTX 3080 but then look at the die size of the 4080 at 379 mm² vs the huge 628 mm² of the 3080 and the other GA102 cards. For sure Nvidia is making good money off of the RTX 4080! And when it comes to performance per watt the RTX 4080 is in a league of its own.

The Zotac Amp Extreme Airo is for now Zotac's top 4080 card sitting above the Trinity. It comes with a boost clock of 2565MHz. Officially that doesn't seem like much of an overclock over the FE's 2505MHz. Some top tier cards ship with 2600MHz+ overclocks but rated boost clocks mean little and you shouldn't worry about that. In my testing the Zotac was able to reach above 2800MHz under default operation.

Many manufacturers have repurposed their 450W+ rated RTX 3090 Ti or RTX 4090 coolers for use with the RTX 4080 and it shows after taking one look at it. It's a big 3.5 slot card. The fan shroud features an unusually curved design too. It incorporates attention grabbing RGB lighting along the length of the card which can be controlled via Zotac's Spectra RGB app.

It's got a full cover metal backplate with another branded RGB element and personally I think it's a great looking card.

Like all RTX 4080s the card comes with a 12+4 pin 12VHPWR connector. In this case it has a 3x 8-pin adapter delivering up to 450W. That's more than enough juice to power the 320W Airo. With 320W you wouldn't think Zotac needed an extreme PCB but in a sign that it's built for a higher TDP the card features a 24-phase VRM with a further three for the memory. Notably the memory is rated for 24Gbps more than the card's 22.4Gbps. So you should have some OC headroom on tap.

Other key features include an RGB header for controlling an external strip and dual BIOS with performance and quiet modes. A quick test didn't reveal any difference and given the overspec cooler leaving it at the performance setting is recommended. Unusually it's controlled by a button rather than a switch with the change applied after a reboot.

The cooler is more of a traditional design eschewing the use of a vapor chamber in favor of a traditional nine-heatpipe baseplate. As expected with such a behemoth of a cooler the heat generated by the AD103 GPU presents absolutely no problem. A peak temperature of just 62°C is excellent while full system power consumption is also good coming in below the previous generation high end cards.

The Zotac uses a little under 20W more power than the Founders Edition but when you factor in all the RGB and an extra fan that's fine.

But the raw wattage number doesn't tell the true story. As the RTX 4080 dramatically outperforms the likes of the RTX 3080 Ti with less power; it's the performance per watt that really stands out. Well done Nvidia!

The RTX 4080 delivers very good performance and the Zotac Amp Extreme Airo is a little better than the FE though not dramatically so given the loosely defined way Nvidia cards boost themselves.

Most of the games that struggled to break 60Hz at 4K can now do so even with ray tracing effects enabled and that's before enabling DLSS. Even in the most demanding titles 1440p at high refresh rates at the highest settings is possible.

Despite its gigantic size however the Zotac card isn't what you'd call silent though it's no leaf blower either. Under heavy gaming loads the card is audible but in no way annoying in tone or volume.

There is the threat of the Radeon RX 7900 XTX too. If you look at our launch day review you can see it's a decent enough competitor though it can't match the RTX 4080 in ray traced games. If that's unimportant to you the XTX is well worth a look. The XT is neither here nor there and isn't a threat to the RTX 4080 apart from its lower price.

Zotac’s RTX 4080 Amp Extreme Airo is a genuine high-end contender. I believe it's a very good-looking card particularly if you're a fan of RGB lighting. Its curved shroud might not appeal to all but to me it's a nice change from otherwise boxy designs.

My sample clocked itself to the highest level I've seen from the three RTX 4080s I've tested to date. It stays cool at all times—as expected given its gargantuan cooler. It's only issue if you can call it that is a noticeable fan level which is really unnecessary when you're dealing with peak temperatures in the low 60s. It's definitely not noisy though.

At $1399| £1319 | AU$2349 the card goes up against premium tier competitors such as the MSI Suprim and Gigabyte Aorus. In my experience so far the MSI has its nose in front by a whisker but in the end it all comes down to price.

The Zotac RTX 4080 Amp Extreme Airo is a fast card very well built it looks great and it will deliver excellent performance on top of the quality Nvidia feature set. But it needs some extra value on top too though the same can be said of all RTX 4080s and all high-end cards in fact. Whether it's an RTX 4080 RTX 4090 or RX 7900 XT/X the prices are tough to swallow right now. Let's hope 2023 brings some better news on that front.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYmV0YW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMTgvbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTQwOTAteWV5aWFuLW9kYWNoaS1nYW1pbmctcGMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Give the gift of an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 this Christmas with a YEYIAN ODACHI prebuilt gaming PC,"Santa Claus is cool and all but let's be honest the gifts his elves make are kind of lame.

Ukraine counts on Elon Musk's Starlink satellite Internet terminals for both civilian and military communication.

4 Reviews

The Russian Sestroretsk arms factory claims that it has developed a Starlink terminal detection radar called Borshchevik which ""is designed to detect and determine the location of Starlink terminals in a 180-degree sector at a distance of up to 10 km."" Not only that but a Russian military blogger boasted on the popular Reverse Side of the Medal Telegram channel that they will soon start testing the Borshchevik Starlink detection system on the field in Ukraine.

At the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine Elon Musk answered the call of Ukrainian official for Starlink satellite Internet coverage and terminals to counter the broadband infrastructure destruction that followed. SpaceX has been providing satellite Internet and terminals in Ukraine ever since to the tune of US$100 million that Elon Musk claims will be spent just this year for the service. Recently SpaceX asked the Pentagon to pick the tab for 2023 or else SpaceX will be on the hook for another US$380 million in Ukraine expenses next year.

Elon Musk also expressed worries that this way SpaceX is an open target for Russian cyberattacks too as Ukraine is increasingly using the Starlink satellite Internet service for military purposes as well. The ever-belligerent Russian military bloggers have been demanding that the Aerospace Forces knock Starlink satellites serving Ukraine directly out of the sky and Russian officials have issued vague threats about it too. The Borshchevik Starlink terminal detection radar if a credible product may allow the army to go about it another way as per its manufacturer:

Direction finding and calculation by algorithms of biangulation of the location of Starlink subscriber equipment with an accuracy of 60m does not exceed 15 minutes per direction finding point. The complex has the ability to be installed on a vehicle chassis which ensures tactical use on the contact lines. The autonomy of the complex is provided by a compact power source or the power system of the vehicle. The elements of the complex can be painted with various types of camouflage including the use of coatings with IR remission. The processing of the received data on the location of Starlink terminals is carried out in a modern graphical interface created according to the UI / UX methodology with the ability to connect topographic maps of the area for intuitive orientation.

While the fog of war coming from Russia and Ukraine makes any of those new military technology or battlefield development claims worth taking with a grain of salt a Russian military blogger casually mentions that Borshchevik will soon be tested by them personally in the field. While talking about probes of another radar detection system of the weapons manufacturer they claim:

Also during the last communication the SOZ spoke about the final stage of testing an interesting development that will allow timely detection of Starlink terminals along the entire line of contact.

If such a Starlink terminal detection radar exists indeed and proves a viable tool for sniffing out satellite Internet communication on the ground in Ukraine it remains to be seen to what extent its potential deployment may impact the scope of SpaceX's presence there.

While we witnessed just one new bike launch from Ducati there were a couple of other interesting updates worth paying attention to. Moreover our review section was updated with a couple of new ride reports which most of you were waiting for. In case you aren’t aware of these stories already here’s a quick round-up.

Ducati DesertX launch

Ducati brought its newest and most hardcore adventure bike the DesertX to India with a price tag of Rs 17.91 lakh. It boasts radical styling an off-road-centric 21-18-inch spoke wheel combination along with a long—travel suspension setup. Ducati has also loaded with a long list of electronic aids along with some practical features like a large 21-litre fuel tank bash plate and tubeless tyres.

Hero-Harley cruiser showcased in India

A bunch of Indian dealers were fortunate enough to see two Hero-Harley co-developed motorcycles last week. One of these was a cruiser visually resembling the Harley-Davidson 338R that we have seen in the past. The other motorcycle was a naked streetfighter with aggressive and sporty styling. It was a potential rival to the KTM 390 Duke. The main purpose of this showcase was to gauge the viewer’s reaction before taking a decision about their India launch.

TVS Apache RR 310 enters Asphalt 8

TVS Motor Company has partnered with Gameloft to introduce the digital form of the Apache RR 310 in the latter’s highly popular motor racing game Asphalt 8: Airborne. Notably TVS is the first Indian two-wheeler brand to bring a virtual racing experience of its motorcycle to Gameloft’s Asphalt 8. With this collaboration the company expects increased awareness about the Apache brand among the youth globally.

Musk slammed the size of Rep. Adam Schiff’s (D-Calif.) “brain” in a tweet.

“Thankfully you lose your chairmanship very soon” Musk wrote Sunday referring to Schiff’s position heading the House Intelligence Committee. “Your brain is too small.”

Schiff will step down as the committee chair as a Republican majority takes over the House.

Musk’s tweet — taken down later in the day — was in response to Schiff’s tweet Friday criticizing Musk’s Twitter policies censoring journalists whose coverage he doesn’t like while allowing the return of Twitter users banned for spreading hate and disinformation.

Musk for example has allowed the Twitter restoration of notorious neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin a racist antisemite homophobe and misogynist who declared in 2018 that women “deserve to be beaten raped and locked in cages.”

Musk calls himself a “free speech absolutist to justify turning a blind eye to hatred and bigotry on Twitter” Schiff wrote.

Elon Musk hops on his massive social media platform to launch a middle-school slam at Rep. Adam Schiff.

Elon Musk hops on his massive social media platform to launch a middle-school slam at Rep. Adam Schiff.

Schiff and Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) earlier this month sent a letter to Musk inquiring about his content moderation strategy in light of research showing that hate speech has spiked on Twitter since Musk took over in October.

Musk insisted the data was “false” but provided no evidence.

As the plane descended a once familiar sight appeared outside the window one that I had not seen for 12 years: the waters of the Arabian Sea the buildings in the distance and then just when you think you’re about to land on the water the runway of Aden’s airport.

When I left Yemen’s capital Sanaa in 2011 with just carry-on luggage I didn’t think I would be away for so long.

But a dictatorship threats and then a war kept me away.

The war was why when I arrived for my visit in April I had to fly to Aden Yemen’s second city in the south of the country and not Sanaa where I’m from in the north. Sanaa is controlled by the Houthis the Iranian-allied rebel group the Saudi-backed government has been fighting since 2014.

As I was to find out despite all those years of fighting and Saudi-led coalition air raids the Houthis are still deeply entrenched in the north.

“You still look the same” said my 31-year-old cousin Ahmed* as he greeted me at the airport. “It’s like you’ve only been away for a short trip.”

Ahmed and the rest of my family have been following my reporting on Yemen from Sweden where I have been based since I left and the country I am now a citizen of. But writing about Yemen is not the same as being in it. As Ahmed hugged me my tears betrayed how I felt about being away from my country and my family.

“Don’t cry” said Ahmed gently as we began the 14-hour road trip to Sanaa. “Save your tears for the destruction and despair that you are about to see.”

Journey into exile

Before leaving Yemen I worked as a journalist. I had just started my blog devoted to covering human rights in the country when the 2011 uprising began. I covered the protests against then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh who had ruled the former North Yemen since 1978 and then when it united with South Yemen in 1990 the Republic of Yemen.

In those early days of the protests there was so much optimism about the future of the country but at the same time massacres of protesters warned of what was to come.

I was frustrated that only a few native Yemeni voices were writing about what was happening in Yemen in English so I started to blog about it.

My writing brought warnings hateful comments and then death threats. But I continued until in May 2011 three years into my work as a full-time reporter at the Yemen Observer newspaper in Sanaa I left for Sweden to participate in a training course I’d applied for before the protests had begun.

While I was away armed fighting started on the streets of Sanaa. “The violence is escalating. Don’t come back now” my family would tell me on the phone. “If you do come back you won’t be able to write you can’t write any more. It’s too dangerous.”

I couldn’t imagine life without writing so at 25 years old I made the decision to stay on my own in Sweden.

In my phone calls with my family the main way I have been able to keep in touch during the long years of my exile the warnings continued.

“If you come back and continue your journalism you’ll end up in prison” my mother would say. “I have no connections to get you out and I will not come to visit you in your cell. You’ll be tortured and raped. Do not come back.”

My mother was terrified that my work would endanger me. Her solution was to try and scare me away from the profession.

I heard their warnings but the pain of being away was growing unbearable. I’m sure everyone says the same thing about their country or the place they grew up in but Yemen had a hold of me.

Covering Yemen from afar was the only thing that filled the void inside me and helped ease the pain of missing home.

An opportunity to return

This April a truce – which ended on October 2 after the Houthis failed to agree on its renewal – brought the opening I was waiting for.

An opportunity to spend the final days of Ramadan and celebrate Eid with the people I loved the most.

But my entire family apart from Ahmed remained oblivious to my plans. After all their warnings I didn’t want to have them worrying while I made the arduous journey.

The trip from Aden to Sanaa was never an easy one – it passes from Yemen’s southern coast through the mountains along winding roads with huge drops and some of the most beautiful scenery you’ll see the landscape changing from Ibb’s green mountains to Dhamar’s fields and then to the dustier and yet still majestic mountains of Sanaa.

That beauty was still there but the trip was now far harder to make.

To avoid front lines the route takes several detours sometimes along roads that can barely be described as such which occasionally flood in the summer rainy season.

Many have lost their lives along these treacherous passages – secondary casualties of this brutal war. Another cause of significant delays: the approximately 40 checkpoints we had to pass through along the road that belonged to the various parties to the conflict.

These checkpoints leave you drained not only because of the gruelling interrogations that take place there but also because of the realisation that you’re in a divided country and Yemen is no longer a united land.

“Where are you from? Show me identification” the guard yelled as Ahmed and I arrived at a checkpoint controlled by the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC).

The United Arab Emirates-backed STC the major force in southern Yemen controls all the checkpoints along the road we took up to the central governorate of al-Bayda.

The STC guards had more questions: What city we were travelling to where the car’s papers were and whether they could take some of our qat (for all of Yemen’s divisions qat a mild narcotic remains a great unifier).

As we drove away from the checkpoint Ahmed explained why we had not had much trouble.“They wanted to know if we were from Sanaa” Ahmed who was born and raised in Sanaa said.

“But my ID says that I’m from Hadramout instead.” Hadramout a large governorate in eastern Yemen has stayed out of much of the tension between the north and south. While it is a southern governorate and separatist sentiment exists there it has been spared much of the direct fighting that has occurred between government forces and separatists in other parts of the south.

Back in 2016 Ahmed had managed to change his identification card to show his residence as Hadramout knowing that it would save him from a lot of suspicion on trips around the country.

Reunited with family and friends

As we travelled the physical effects of this war became visible. Refugees and migrants seemingly east African walked along the roads having picked a country at war to be their transit point to the Gulf. Tents housing internally displaced people dotted the landscape.

Infrastructure – such as roads bridges and houses – was destroyed. Air raids and shelling had left roads impassable forcing cars onto alternate routes.

“The car accidents that happen because of these unpaved roads are horrific” Ahmed told me almost nonchalantly.

“You know I follow a great Facebook page that shares updates about car accidents and I never drive without checking it.”

When we arrived in Sanaa I went straight to my family’s home. They were shocked and overjoyed to see me. Seeing my mother again and being able to hold her was amazing.

After all the hugs and tears of happiness she was able to give me comprehensive updates on everything that had happened to our neighbours relatives and friends.

Some had passed away some had fallen ill and many others had lost their jobs and depended on donations.

Things were a lot worse than when I left. My conversations with family members and friends were often about the catastrophic economic hardships that they had to go through on a daily basis.

Even if you receive your salary and many millions do not it is often worthless as a result of high inflation. Food prices are now extraordinarily higher than before I left Yemen with some items at approximately the same price as I would see in my local supermarket in Stockholm and sometimes even higher.

“Thank God I still have a job but the salary isn’t enough to pay for all my monthly expenses” my cousin Najat* who is like an older sister to me explained. Hearing her recount the hardship of the last few years made me sad and outraged.

Her side hustle making and selling bakhour wood chips soaked in perfumed oil and burned as traditional incense was helping her get by.

“If I didn’t have that I don’t know how I would have survived” she said. “At home we try to minimise our expenses: We almost never use electronics such as the television or the fridge because we need to lower our electricity bills. We buy and eat meat only on special occasions maybe twice a year during Eid because it’s so expensive.

“I walk most of the time because transport has become so expensive amid the fuel shortages.”

Surviving on generosity

For my aunt who used to be a teacher at a state school it was the same. “I used to receive a salary of 40000 Yemeni riyals [$160 at the official rate] before the war. But I stopped going to work in 2017 because they stopped paying me.

“I tried to find another job in another school but they only offered me 20000 riyals [$80]. What can I do with that today? Our house rent on its own is 35000 [$140].” My aunt has stopped trying to find work and stays at home her family solely reliant on her husband’s salary.

The solution as presented to me by everyone I spoke to was simple: They didn’t want aid or donations as that wouldn’t help them in the long term. What they wanted was their jobs decent salaries and an end to the depreciation of the national currency and inflation.

Clearly that will not come for a long time. And so I asked myself how are people surviving?

Quite simply: on each other’s generosity.

In both Sanaa and Aden where I spent a week I was struck by how people looked out for each other something that I have often missed in Sweden. As Ramadan wound down I was reminded of the traditions that I had left behind in Yemen. Our neighbours would knock on our door and bring us food unasked.

My mother would do the same for them cooking big portions of food and sharing it with whomever she could. I would go shopping with Najat but instead of buying clothes for herself she was buying special clothes for Eid for the children in her neighbourhood.

“Let me buy clothes for those poor kids as a charity” she said as we were heading to the shops.

“I heard one store had good sales so we’ll go there. At least my bakhour business gave me some spare money last month.”

The Houthi state

As I travelled around Sanaa I was reminded that I was in a city ruled by the Houthis.

The signs had been there even as we travelled to the city. At the checkpoints the guards were less interested in where we were from than they were in whether we observed the rules of their state such as the use of old and tattered bank notes instead of the new ones used in government and STC-controlled territory.

The Houthis had banned the new currency printed since 2019 seeing it as a way of undermining their control.

While the vibe of Aden – laid-back cosmopolitan and welcoming – had been much the same as when I left Yemen in 2011 Sanaa had changed.

Without exaggeration it feels like a city that has been invaded. When the Houthis marched in from the mountains of the far north of Yemen they brought with them the visible signs of their rule – the green posters depicting their slogan: “God is Great Death to the USA Death to Israel Curse the Jews” – as well as the things that were harder to see such as the way they have enforced their religious and political ideology on the people.

It felt like everywhere I went I could hear the voice of the group’s leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi.

His location is unknown hidden away out of fear of a Saudi air attack but his voice could be heard from cars with large speakers on top replaying his latest speech.

The brainwashing has had its effect. On the walls of Sanaa alongside the Houthi slogan are posters of their “martyrs”.

‘Death to this and death to that’

The Houthis have sent thousands to the front lines to fight the government and the STC. Many of the faces staring back at me from the posters were children. Seeing that was devastating.

“Death to this and death to that” said Najat as we passed by one of the Houthi posters. “It’s terrifying. I don’t know how I can protect my seven-year-old daughter from hearing that it’s everywhere I go. Imagine your children growing up in a culture that glorifies death. What kind of future will we have? What kind of generation are we creating?”

My relatives and friends told me to be careful of the Zaynabiyat as I walked the streets. Female forces recruited by the Houthis to carry out a wide range of security and military services including intelligence gathering. They are hard to notice as they walk in civilian clothing and can’t be picked out of a crowd.

The Zaynabiyat some of them brought in as young girls are recruited through a mix of ideology and economic incentives.

“Never speak to a woman you don’t know at a wedding” Najat said to me one day as my mother listened. “You never know she might be one of the Zaynabiyat. At one wedding a woman was talking to me and started asking me if I wanted to contribute to the Houthi war effort by donating my jewellery. She told me she was one of them.”

My mother interjected. “Last year one of our neighbour’s sisters was summoned to the police station – she had said something against the Houthis at a wedding. One of the Zaynabiyat definitely heard her.”

The United Nations Panel of Experts on Yemen has reported that the work of the Zaynabiyat is to repress and control women in prisons professional workspaces and in public places.

“If you’re discovered they [the Houthis] will detain you and torture you” I was warned. It reminded me of an article I read a few years ago detailing the abuses such as beatings and psychological torture committed against dissident women by the Houthis.

I also remembered the ordeal of the detained and prosecuted Yemeni model Intissar al-Hammadi who I had researched for my previous work at Human Rights Watch.

Intissar is still in a Houthi prison. Sanaa has become the heart of a republic of fear. The Houthis claimed they were bringing a revolution against the corrupt when they took the capital in 2014. But they have now become the corrupt imposing their ruthless political and security repression on everyone in the areas they control.

Meanwhile members of the internationally-recognised government of Yemen have also been accused of being involved in abuses. According to human rights groups Saudi Arabia along with the UAE has conducted indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in many parts of Yemen.

All parties to the conflict have been accused of committing violations of international human rights laws that rights organisations say could amount to war crimes.

New Yemens

It’s impossible to predict what the future holds for Yemen. The current de-facto division is likely to become permanent. The Yemeni state I grew up in has disintegrated.

All the stories my family and friends told me during my visit demonstrated to me that the eight-year conflict has split the country into many parts.

In the midst of the destruction new Yemens are emerging waiting for sufficient political will from either local or international actors to acknowledge it.

Ahmed and his Yemeni ID card with his false home of Hadramout started to make sense. “See there is more than one Yemen today” he said. “The reason I changed my ID and pretended that I was from Hadramout is because it’s seen as peaceful. The other Yemens the one in the north and the one in the south are in a raging war. The division and rivalry between the north and the south is impossible to resolve. Northerners can have their Yemen. Southerners can have their Yemen. And I prefer the Yemen in Hadramout.”

Yemenis disagree on what the solution is. To me the potential division of Yemen would be the lesser of two evils. In its current form with the current circumstances and tension unity has become catastrophic for citizens across the country.

If Yemen’s relatively young unification project ends it might be shaky and risky but at least people might have a second chance to envision a new stable country of their own.

Is this something I want? Not necessarily but it’s rather a matter that I try to be realistic about.

In the last few days of my near-month-long trip as I prepared to go back into my exile Ahmed drove me in his car and we passed Sanaa University where the 2011 uprising began.

There was the monument the place we had called Change Square. “What do you feel when you see this place now?” Ahmed asked me. “One part of me feels like I am visiting a graveyard where my generation’s dreams and aspirations for a democratic Yemen were born and died” I responded.

“But another part of me thinks that there are no shortcuts for going from dictatorship to democracy. Counter-revolutions are inevitable. Just like Saleh was overthrown the Houthis will be overthrown.”

Ahmed nodded. With at least some hope in his voice he started speaking about the time when it all began for me the 2011 revolution when I had so much hope for the country’s future.

“The past has shown that no matter what Yemen will continue to live to survive and to resist.”

But the circumstances behind the cousin’s disappearance were peculiar Stewart said later. The cousin called her family and told them she was in Phoenix but didn't say how she got there or why. The answers to those questions surprised Stewart when she drove out to get her cousin.

“They told me they knew my brother” Stewart remembered her cousin telling her. “We were going on a one-day trip and they would bring me home the next day. It only started with four people in that Suburban but more got in later. One guy said he worked at San Juan hospital and he knew my brother and told me he comes down to the Valley for the weekends” the cousin told Stewart.

The encounter leading to what some say is human trafficking has become an increasing concern and has been reported not only on the Navajo Nation but in other tribal communities across the state. It was the focus of a hearing last month of the legislative Ad Hoc Committee for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples where Stewart and others told their stories.

They talked about how scammers target the most vulnerable individuals in tribal communities people who are unsheltered battling substance and alcohol abuse or suffering from various mental illnesses and who are often found walking throughout towns close to the Navajo Nation like Farmington and Gallup. The people are picked up promised help at sober living centers or rehab centers and taken to complete paperwork.

But authorities say these scammers work for treatment homes that try to take advantage of the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System using so-called pop-up sober living centers scattered throughout the city.

The system's American Indian Health Program provides medically necessary services for enrolled members including coverage for preventive and behavioral health care services.

""I know AHCCCS is aware of it. But how far will it go before they do something"" said Stewart in a phone interview with The Arizona Republic.

The Republic reached out to AHCCCS but no one has returned the call.

Some people aren't allowed to leave the centers

Though some people have gone willingly some are also coerced or forced Stewart said. She and Coleen Chatter both enrolled members of the Navajo Nation have been working to bring this to the attention of authorities and tribal leaders for months. Some advocates believe the scams are contributing to the growing number of missing Indigenous people.

Chatter lost her sister in 2011. The sister she said during the public hearing was recruited by an individual in her community to go to a group home. Such sober living facilities aren't new she said and since the start of the pandemic AHCCCS seemingly has not been regulating the facilities. Chatter said the agency also hasn't been regulating nonmedical transportation companies which was previously reported to be another form of predatory service found on the Navajo Nation.

""Each of us has a unique story to tell"" said Chatter who has paid for victims to get home. ""My sister because of the extent of alcohol and drugs used in these group homes there was domestic violence that happened and she was dropped off in front of PIMC (Phoenix Indian Medical Center). And ever since then I've been advocating. Something's gotta be done.""

Stewart’s cousin was able to leave the center where she was taken but Stewart said there are others who are still holed up in such facilities and she has heard countless stories from people who escaped or from victims' families who described the buildings as unsafe and cramped with other Indigenous victims.

“These unsheltered Native people have told us they have escaped from these homes” said Stewart. “Some are literally locked inside these homes from the outside. Some of these Native people had to escape over the walls. Some homes we looked at have cameras all over the place.”

At a meeting of the legislative Ad Hoc Committee for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples last month on the Salt River-Pima Maricopa Indian Community members of the committee such as State Rep. Jennifer Jermaine the chairperson discussed a rise in missing people being found at drug and alcohol treatment centers in Phoenix.

“It is illegal through federal and Arizona law to pay individuals to procure patients for treatment at these centers” said Jermaine D-Chandler. “And several cases have been referred to the U.S. Attorney's Office for prosecution. We are exploring going after the licensing of these organizations under the Arizona Department of Health Services.”

People are left without clothes phones or money

State Sen. Theresa Hatathlie is well aware of this concern. As a member of the committee Hatathlie said she was notified by a couple whose son was missing. The son had last been seen at a grocery store where he usually hung out.

“Many of our relatives are out there with various forms of addiction” said Hatathlie a Democrat. “This young man’s addiction was alcohol. Many knew him and knew where he usually hung out. They did searches in the community. This continued throughout the summer.”

In August Hatathlie said the mother got a call from her son and he told his mom he was actually picked up at this grocery store by employees of a rehab center. He said they brought him to Phoenix and he was not able to contact anyone. When he was finally allowed to contact his parents he said he wanted to stay in the center.

Bringing awareness:Families and advocates seek justice for missing and murdered Indigenous people

“All in all these are the types of stories I’d prefer to hear” said Hatathlie. “However I do know of two scenarios where the parents had to say their final goodbyes. Some of these clients were picked up in that same fashion were found by metropolitan police out here with inadequate shoes and then clothes they don't normally wear without identification cell phones or money.”

Gila River Indian Community Lt. Gov. Monica Antone spoke at the meeting and said members of her tribe have been reaching out to her with their concerns about these homes. As a leader she has been told stories including one that sticks with her about a woman who may have been sexually assaulted.

“I personally have brought a couple of our community members to our tribal council and worked with our Behavior Health Services and DHS and IHS and we got them on board” said Antone. “There have been numerous stories. It's starting to be a heinous issue. AHCCCS needs to crunch down on what they’re authorizing.”

Hatathlie said the sober living providers can make a lot of money by going through a process to become certified as an Indian Health Provider under AHCCCS.

“Some of these homes and centers are bringing these individuals and housing them in hotels in really low-paying hotels and then shepherded to private medical facilities"" said Hatathlie. ""They get their bill of health and everything and then shipped back to the central location where they become certified with AHCCCS and they sign up for DES food stamps. Not only is it human trafficking it's a fraud.”

Authorities link scams to missing people

The Navajo Nation Police recently posted on social media that approximately 77 individuals in the Navajo Nation were missing with some missing since the 1970s including 28 females and 49 males. The posters would be distributed and displayed in all Navajo Police Department districts and periodically updated.

In September the FBI released the second update of its list of Native Americans verified as missing in New Mexico and the Navajo Nation. There was a total of 183 missing Indigenous persons on the latest list: 21 individuals have been added and 24 removed since last month’s list of 186 names was released.

When the list was first released in July there were 177 names on it. The updated list current as of Sept. 13 has 115 males and 68 females. Men are reported to be the people who make up most of those who are being targeted and taken to these homes in Phoenix. It's also reported that victims are also taken from New Mexico to Phoenix it's not just an Arizona issue.

Navajo police posted that they are aware of people typically in vans or SUVs recruiting Navajo residents to live in behavioral health residential facilities in Phoenix. Police said the facilities are commonly known as sober homes or group homes. The recruiters do not generally work for just one company and have been spotted at places where gatherings are common such as flea markets and often approach people they see walking.

“We encourage residents not to get into vehicles with individuals they do not know even for a short ride” stated the social media post.

Attempts for comment from Navajo Police Chief Daryl Noon have been unsuccessful. But Navajo Nation Criminal Investigations Director Michael Henderson wrote in an email to the Republic that the FBI Phoenix office has completed some interviews at locations in Phoenix.

“It shows a common denominator of being enticed with alcoholic beverages at the time people were picked up on the Navajo Nation” wrote Henderson. “Although the motive behind the incidents are still unclear there seems to be a scheme of sorts. The FBI and the Navajo Police are encouraging the public to be aware of being enticed to catch a ride and immediately report such activities to the authorities should they experience it.”

Hatathlie met with the Navajo Health Education and Human Services Committee to talk on the issue further. During this meeting the Navajo Division of Behavioral and Mental Health Services reported they have raised the issue with AHCCCS. They reported that after the pandemic Arizona has been allowing more of these centers to open and because of this the Navajo behavioral health services division has a list of preferred legitimate centers.

“This has been an ongoing issue for a couple of years” said Karen Johnson the clinical director of Navajo Division of Behavioral and Mental Health Services. “I talked to someone at Phoenix Indian Medical Center they were hearing of clients being picked up and they weren’t cognitive enough to understand what was happening. They would be drinking and picked up they’d be so inebriated and brought to the ER and almost died. This has been a problem in the Gallup area and probably the Window Rock area. It happens quite often.”

Stewart’s cousin who was coerced into going to Phoenix told Stewart that because she refused to give her information to the people operating the sober living facility she was told to leave and given a one-day bus pass. When her pass expired she began walking all over Phoenix. While on the bus she was trying to figure out how she would hitchhike back home but in the end Stewart found her and her family took her home.

But even if her cousin hadn’t consumed alcohol in over three days at that point Stewart said her cousin was under the influence of something. Her cousin was unable to tell her where the home she was taken to was but said there were other individuals still there who were also picked up and taken to these sites. After this incident Stewart and Chatter lent their support to individuals who have experienced these sober home living facilities.

“I think I got over 1000 pages of people reaching out to me” said Stewart. “With the help of (Chatter) we started collaborating. We started hearing stories of these people going to flea markets and stores anywhere just to pick them up. It's unbelievable the amount of stories coming out. Now we have families being recruited into these homes. We've got families who have lost their loved ones because they were found outside of the home. We've had others advocate and they feel their voices haven't been heard. It's more than an epidemic. It's bad.""

Photo credit: Courtesy: NCM

The New Children’s Museum is collaborating with an artist-in-residence on a new workshop “Community Looms” to engage visitors in the creation of textile sculptures.

The workshop continuing through Jan. 9 is inspired by Michelle Montjoy’s work in engaging community members. She has held similar versions of the workshop at the Oceanside Museum of Art Art Produce Gallery in North Park and Sophie’s Gallery in El Cajon.

The events feature three large looms 36 inches in diameter at which up to eight participants work together to knit material made from recycled or donated T-shirts.

Participants will learn Montjoy’s technique as well as breathing and meditative exercises facilitated by museum teaching artists.

The finished knitted sculptures are slated to be displayed in the museum.

“Using familiar textile material and joyful colors these oversized hand-built looms transform

what is usually a singular activity into a connected communal action” Montjoy said. “Not only

do participants get to tap into the calming nature of simple repetitive looping actions but each stitch in the knitted sculpture physically represents the time and hand of the person who made it.”

The workshop is a continuation of the museum’s collaboration with Montjoy which included a sensory-friendly installation on the museum’s main level called Breathing

Room. The installation is meant to provide a space for families and children to reflect and relax in an otherwise high-activity environment.

Gabrielle Wyrick chief curator and director of audience engagement at the New Children’s Museum called the installation and workshop an example of “how community access and art are all interconnected.”

The artist residency is funded by a $10000 grant from the ResMed Foundation with the looming sessions to be held in the Rosso Family Foundation Innovators LAB.

The “Community Looms” workshops are free with museum admission ($20 for adults and $18 for children) through Jan. 9 at 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. during regular museum hours for ages 6 and up. The museum is closed Tuesdays.

An additional drop-in activity weaving yarn recycled T-shirts and natural materials into a tapestry also will be available for visitors of all ages.",,,,,,,,,,,,

 46% of the 2500 professionals surveyed said they are currently looking or plan to look for a new position in the first half of 2023 up 41% from six months ago.

The most likely demographic to search for a new gig is 18-to-25-year-olds (60%) followed by human resource professionals (58%) employees who have been with their employer between two and four years (55%) and working parents (53%) according to Robert Half.

""Noise around hiring freezes and layoffs at some companies hasn't seemed to faze workers — many are just as confident in their job prospects as they were six months ago"" Robert Half senior executive director Paul McDonald said in the report. ""The labor market remains tight and professionals are curious about exploring new and more fulfilling career paths.""

What are the main reasons so many Americans are looking for a change?

According to Robert Half 61% of those who plan to job hunt said the primary factor is a higher salary followed by better benefits and perks (37%) and a greater flexibility to choose when and where they work (36%).

Nearly one-third (29%) of those surveyed said they are considering quitting their job to pursue a full-time contracting career and 40% said they would return to a former company if given a salary equal or higher to their current pay according to Robert Half.

Per Robert Half when applying for jobs top turn-offs that cause candidates to lose interest are unclear or unreasonable job responsibilities (56%) poor communication with the hiring manager (50%) and misalignment with the company culture and values (36%).

""The employment landscape is changing day to day and it will be interesting to see how the next few months pan out” McDonald said. “Regardless of what happens employers can't take their foot off the pedal when it comes to earning trust and driving engagement with current staff and creating a positive experience for potential hires.""

Robert Nicoletti was speeding and unable to navigate a turn on Santiago Canyon Road when he struck a silver Mazda SUV and a blue Toyota in the Santa Ana Mountain community of Silverado Anselmo Templado Public Information Officer of the California Highway Patrol told Fox News Digital.

Nicoletti was ejected from the Ferrari and pronounced dead at the scene. The motorists in the other two cars suffered minor injuries.

Alcohol did not appear to be a factor in the fatal crash which left debris scattered along the highway and hillside.

Aerial footage of the scene from Fox 11 Los Angeles showed the red Ferrari was shattered in pieces by the impact with the rear of the vehicle effectively sawed off from the passenger seats.

Nicoletti was a 71-year-old retired dental salesman according to The Daily Mail.

Shocking footage and images from the scene showed the aftermath of the three-vehicle crash in which the 2015 Ferrari slammed into a silver Mazda SUV and a blue Toyota. The Tesla did not stop and the model of the vehicle is unknown.

Robert Nicoletti 71 was a retired dental salesman described as 'a wonderful person' by family members.

Police do not believe alcohol was involved and indicated that high speed was a factor. The road markings where the crash happened show overtaking is not allowed but it's unclear whether that is the case where the incident began.

After the name of the deceased was announced friends and family members came together to remember him for the 'wonderful' father grandfather and man he was.

'It is with heavy heart that a great Father uncle brother and friend to so many was killed yesterday afternoon in a horrific car accident' wrote Mike Anderson.

Anderson identifies himself in the post as Nicoletti's ex-brother in law.

He said: 'I will always be grateful for him always being there for my Daughters and grandson in California.'

'God gained an amazing Angel. Love you Bob' Anderson wrote.

'Bob I always loved you and we remained close for the last 30 years and I will miss that contiguous laugh and smile may you rest in peace my friend.'

'I miss you already Uncle Bob. You were such a wonderful man and Godfather. I can’t wait to see you in heaven and give you a big hug' wrote Nicole Stone Neuland.

Kyle Nicoletti Robert's son posted a sweet image of his father following his tragic death.

'Man this hits home. Your dad was the s**t and I have so many stories and jokes from him. You and all your fam are in my hearts and prayers' responded one person to Kyle's Facebook profile photo change.

The crash happened in Santiago Canyon near the town of Silverado which is located in the Santa Ana Mountains in eastern Orange County.

California Highway Patrol said they were called around 3:40pm.

They found a scene of shocking devastation with the cars mangled and smashed - and the 2015 Ferrari cut in two.

Debris scattered the road and dirt was thrown up from the hillsides.

Parts of the red Ferrari are seen scattered all over the road. The driver reportedly accelerated to prevent a Tesla from overtaking

The Mazda and Toyota were damaged in the front but the Ferrari was almost unrecognizable.

Anselmo Templado a public information officer for the California Highway Patrol said that Nicoletti sustained fatal injuries when he was ejected from the vehicle due to the force of the impact.

He said that Nicoletti was going too fast and unable to navigate the curve.

'Speed was probably a factor' said Sgt. Kris Ulibarri with the CHP's Santa Ana office.

'We're still investigating but as you can see the Ferrari is split in half.'

In 2020 McDonald's opened a restaurant in Walt Disney World that was 100% powered by solar energy reports Fast Company. A combination of solar panels installed on the roof and solar glass windows around the building generated enough energy to keep the entire kitchen and dining room running. At the time Carol Ross Barney head of the architecture firm that designed the building said this project would serve as an experiment for McDonald's to test how far it could make solar power work for its operations. Indeed the transition hasn't come without challenges.

As SolarCompanies.com explains fast food restaurants require more energy than gas stations and retail stores. Industrial freezers grills fryers ordering kiosks and air conditioning take up a lot of power — and for compact fast food restaurants finding space to put all those solar panels can be a challenge. Some fast food stores are even further limited by their geographic locations. Particularly in major cities many restaurants exist on the first floor of a skyscraper. Multiple floors of apartments and offices stacked on top of a ground-floor McDonald's means a solar panel up on the roof isn't a practical placement.

Fast Company reported that by 2030 McDonald's emissions would have to be 36% lower than they were in 2015 to stay on target for the goals it had in 2020. In October 2021 McDonald's announced its goal of becoming totally emissions-neutral by 2050. Recently the company revealed the latest development in its environmental journey: Hundreds of locations are going solar.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cmVjb3JkLmNvLnVrL2F5cnNoaXJlL25ldy1tYXNzaXZlLWJtLW9wZW5pbmctZGF0ZS0yODc2MjMyMtIBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cmVjb3JkLmNvLnVrL2F5cnNoaXJlL25ldy1tYXNzaXZlLWJtLW9wZW5pbmctZGF0ZS0yODc2MjMyMi5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New massive B&M opening date announced as search for staff launched,"We have more newsletters

The opening date for a huge new B&M store in Kilmarnock has been announced.

The discount retailer has taken charge of three shop units to make one giant store in the town.

Work has been underway at the Glencairn Retail Park superstore since June this year with blueprints initially unveiled in February 2022.

B&M already have a sizeable store in Kilmarnock at Queen's Drive Retail Park.

A sign in the existing store reveals that the new megastore will open on February 4 next year.

The sign also states that the retailer is recruiting both full and part-time staff for the new store. Workers with garden centre experience are also being recruited.

Proposals were previously approved to combine the three shops to make one giant store.

Poundstretcher was the only occupied unit with both Brantano Footwear and DW Sport already closed.

But Poundstretcher was closed earlier this year and work is now nearing completion to form what could be one of the town's biggest shops.

Poundstretcher did open a town centre store in Fowlds Street in April last year. Bosses at the discount chain assured customers at the time that the Glencairn Retail Park store wouldn't close.

The new unit is set to sell food and non-food items and the service yard at the rear changed to form a garden centre.

The entrance to the shop would be via the ex DW Sports doors with the Pound Stretcher and Brantano entries being transformed into fire exits.

The mega unit will sit alongside Dunelm Poundland Food Warehouse TK Maxx Halfords and Greggs.

Anyone that wants to apply for a position at the new store can hand in their CV to the B&M store at the Queen's Drive Retail Park.

The line held its official naming ceremony on Dec. 10 ahead of which it took news media members on a two-night preview cruise.

Just like its sister ships Wonder of the Seas brings the familiar neighborhood concept that helps travelers avoid feeling like they’re crammed on a ship with thousands of fellow cruisers.

Royal Caribbean Wonder of the Seas began sailing from Port Canaveral for year-round service in November 2022. It’s the current record holder for world’s largest cruise ship. It’s seen here dwarfing Anthem of the Seas docked alongside on Thursday Dec. 8 2022 at Royal Caribbean’s private Bahamas island Coco Cay.

“The neighborhoods ebb and flow like neighborhoods in any community” said Royal Caribbean President and CEO Michael Bayley. “When we’re designing the ship we give a lot of thought to the natural cadence of the movement of people during the day.”

A lot of the features found on board are familiar to the class including the signature Central Park open space carved out of the middle of the ship the Boardwalk at the aft with its own carousel and the top-deck three-waterslide attraction The Perfect Storm.

It’s also once again home to the twin dry slides called the Ultimate Abyss which allows thrill seekers to climb into its signature angler fish entryway and twist their way down 10 decks below in just seconds.

The ship though has other features that set it apart.

At the top of the list is bacon. OK it’s a Southern restaurant concept called The Mason Jar within which bacon makes several notable cameos such as the garnish along with a cherry in a drink called the “Far From Manhattan.”

This image taken Wednesday Dec. 7 2022 shows the new Southern restaurant concept The Mason Jar and one of its signature cocktails the Far From Manhattan.

The restaurant though is more than just spirits. It’s comfy homey chairs a live band with a smiling portrait of Dolly Parton overlooking the stage and a geographic hopscotch across Southern states on the menu.

It’s certainly not the only specialty dining on board with the return of the two-deck molecular gastronomy cuisine offering Wonderland plus mainstays 150 Central Park Chops Grille Giovanni’s Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar Hooked Seafood Izumi sushi and teppanyaki Playmakers Sports Bar & Arcade and Johnny Rockets with costs ranging from around $10-$70 per person among the options.

There’s plenty of complimentary dining on board as well including the Windjammer buffet Park Cafe in Central Park with the line’s roast beef Kummelweck sandwich El Loco Fresh with its seriously tasty hot sauces Boardwalk Dog House Sorrento’s pizza and others.

Those on liquid diets will find plenty of options including the robotic bartender-staffed Bionic Bar traditional Schooner Bar Cantina Fresca Boleros Cask & Clipper Rising Tide Bar Wipeout Bar (near the FlowRider) Trellis Bar in Central Park Solarium Bar and The Lime & Coconut concept that’s been rolled out across much of Royal’s fleet since debuting aboard Navigator of the Seas in 2019.

And don’t worry there’s also a Starbucks.

Most of the bars and restaurants are peppered across the eight neighborhoods so there are gastronomic options around every corner although sometimes it takes a long walk to reach that corner.

With the ship’s enormity the cruise line also decided to pull most of its suites into one neighborhood making it the only Oasis-class ship with eight. The other Oasis-class ships have seven with Central Park Boardwalk Pool & Sports Zone Entertainment Place Royal Promenade Vitality Spa & Fitness Center and Youth Zone.

Other changes on Wonder include offering only one FlowRider surf simulator while opening up space for an underwater-themed outdoor play area for families called Wonder Playscape with mini-golf slides climbing walls and an interactive touch mural. The whole space lights up with neon at night with a vivid orange octopus lording over it.

Another change is the addition of the new Vue Bar that took the place of one of the cantilevered hot tubs found on other Oasis-class ships that allows for a nice vantage of the ocean.

It’s also the third ship after Symphony of the Seas and Spectrum of the Seas to feature the priciest suite available — the Ultimate Family Suite complete with its own slide Lego wall digital game table hot tub and stairwell that plays music as you walk on the steps. Costs vary but can quite often hit $25000 or more for a one-week cruise.

The ship’s size also comes to the forefront when sitting in the main dining room that spans three decks or choosing from the hundreds of tables across the buffet that’s now the largest in the fleet.

But the details in each space make cruisers feel more like they’re moving among intimate spaces. At times beholding the size of the ship is a treat like people-watching in a large city or enjoying the breeze created by the wind tunnel amid Central Park.

But the details can be welcome distractions as well from the Alice in Wonderland-decorated elevator doors adjacent to Wonderland to the red Mustang parked on the promenade to the white leather and red velvet couches inside the somewhat hidden comedy venue The Attic.

Just as on several other Royal Caribbean ships the stage has been set for big shows in three media: traditional theater an ice skating rink and the massive AquaTheater each with a new show unique to Wonder of the Seas.

The ship’s AquaTheater has a massive clamshell feature at the aft of the ship that helps stave off the elements at showtime and with musical homages pulled from movie scores like “Interstellar” and “The Matrix.” The all-female diving aerobatic and tightrope-walking performers embrace their show’s name “inTENse” with 55-foot high dives and even a patented whirling water-and-light display that looks similar to fireworks.

“It’s a frenzy. It’s meant to be chaos. It’s an emotional experience for that cast every night. Sometimes they’re in tears” said Royal Caribbean’s vice president of entertainment Nick Weir. “We thought we should max this one. Let’s turn everything to 10. More dives than we’ve ever done. More volume. More motion. More everything. Everything turned to 10.”

While the ship may be big the mini ice rink Studio B which is open for cruisers to try their frozen sea legs upon during part of the sailing is home to a more technicolor treat with the skating show “365: The Seasons on Ice.” It opens with The Beatles’ “Here Comes the Sun” and migrates through a potpourri of musical stylings while projection lighting coupled with seriously talented skating routines replete with spins and flips is similar to viewing a kaleidoscope.

There’s also a black-light puppet show for kids on board and the occasional surprise “stowaway piano” player who makes appearances randomly on the ship’s elevators.

For the main stage show in the Royal Theater though the line has created a sequel for “The Effectors” superhero offering that debuted on Odyssey of the Seas this one titled “The Effectors II: Crash ‘n’ Burn” because superhero shows need sequels Weir said.

Even if Marvel movies aren’t your cup of tea 48 choreographed drones that play a central role to the storyline are appropriate to the ship’s name while the music is a combination of familiar popular tunes along with some catchy original songs.

Technology ought to get top-billing as well with a memorable laser-light sequence and an eye-tricking routine in which live actors trade spaces with digital versions in giant smartphones.

“This is all clever stuff for a cruise line” Weir said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9ub3J3ZWdpYW4tcHJpbWEtZm9yLWx1eHVyeS1jcnVpc2Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can luxury cruisers fall in love with Norwegian Prima? TPG finds out.,"2022 has seen the debut of some pretty spectacular cruise ships including Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas Disney Wish Seabourn Venture and Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection's Evrima.

However when the 3215-passenger Norwegian Prima first set sail in July my Instagram feed blew up with images that I couldn't get out of my mind.

I gawked at the Penrose Atrium with its soaring ceiling spiked with sculptures and wondered if they were geometric shapes birds or starfish. I took in Le Bistro's signature eye-level chandeliers that looked as tall as I was and found myself intrigued.

While I normally gravitate to small ships and luxury lines like Silversea and Seabourn I couldn't help but think ""Could Norwegian Prima be right for me?""

Historically when it comes to mainstream cruise lines I've been partial to Celebrity Cruises for its beautiful ships terrific crews a bevy of extra perks for suite passengers and fine dining options.

It's not that I don't like what Norwegian has to offer. It's just that it wasn't a perfect match for me based on two previous sailings: one on Norwegian Gem and the other on Pride of America (an excellent way to see Hawaii by the way).

Those earlier experiences made me think of Norwegian Cruise Line as being a solid choice among the mainstream cruise lines. However NCL is doing a lot these days to evolve toward a more premium product and Norwegian Prima is the first of six ships in the line's new ""Prima Class.""

When I saw my colleague Gene Sloan's Norwegian Prima photos from the ship's inaugural sailing in July — combined with everything I was seeing in my social feeds — it got me thinking that I needed to revisit this line.

Luckily an opportunity to board Prima knocked on my door and I was thrilled to experience three nights on board. Would this quick trip change my opinion of the line and big-ship cruising? Here's how Norwegian Prima stacked up in all the areas important to this small-ship luxury cruise fan.

Inspiring surroundings

Aft seating area. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE

Norwegian Prima is beautiful without being over-the-top or garish. The muted colors — lots of sea greens blues and creams — are soothing. The atrium was a vibrant meeting place one that I looked forward to spending time in rather than just passing through.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 ANDREA ROTONDO/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2 3

Each of the 18 lounges on the ship has its own personality and the furniture across the ship was universally comfortable.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 ANDREA ROTONDO/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2

My favorite spots included the Observation Lounge on Deck 17 forward and the outdoor seating peppered along Deck 8's Indulge Outdoor Lounge. My husband and I were able to find a cozy daybed for two as well as a quiet nook where we could talk with friends who were also on board.

ANDREA ROTONDO/THE POINTS GUY

Bigger groups could easily gather in the living room-like setting that fronts the Soleil outdoor bar.

ANDREA ROTONDO/THE POINTS GUY

The only spot on the ship we avoided was the Metropolitan bar on Deck 7. It was adjacent to The Humidor Cigar Lounge and even with a double door the smell of smoke was too much for us. That was a disappointment since the Metropolitan bar experience was a highlight for Gene when he sailed aboard Prima.

While many ships pack everything onto one main pool deck Norwegian Prima breaks up its seating areas so you can find what speaks to you: sun shade or a combination plus a buzzy bar or space for quiet contemplation. Music was piped in around the ship but it was never overbearing. At the main pool the music was livelier but never loud and obnoxious.

ANDREA ROTONDO/THE POINTS GUY

You'll also find hot tubs and infinity pools on the sun decks that are perfect for small groups. Infinity Beach is the spot on Deck 8 where you'll find small infinity pools that are perfect for taking a dip and watching the ocean's waves. For a more traditional pool deck experience head to Deck 17 with a larger swim space and plenty of loungers in both the sun and shade.

While I am not a spa person I can attest that the Mandara Spa & Salon aboard Norwegian Prima is drop-dead gorgeous. It even has a two-story indoor waterfall. The thermal suite was very popular on my cruise as were treatments such as the aroma stone and Swedish massages.

Food and drinks

I envy people who aren't food motivated. It would make life so much easier if that were the case for me too. But I'm Italian and culturally we use food to communicate both information and emotions. I may put too much emphasis on the dining and drinking aspects of a cruise but they are crucial to me.

I also feel that well-prepared food and atmospheric lounges on a ship indicate that similar care and attention have been placed on other aspects of the cruise experience such as the spa options shore excursions and shipboard entertainment.

The dining options aboard Prima exceeded my expectations. If I were to cruise that ship again I would purchase a specialty dining package to access the premium restaurants each evening. (Note that prepaid dining packages usually don't include the gratuity so you'll still get a bill at the end of the meal for a 20% tip plus any premium beverages you've ordered.)

This was a short three-night voyage so I couldn't try all the dining venues that I wanted but what I sampled exceeded my expectations in all but one instance.

In fact I found the dining options aboard Norwegian Prima to be far superior to previous experiences I've had on Norwegian Gem and Pride of America. The restaurant selection was wide (Mediterranean French Mexican gastro-pub Asian and more). The menus were interesting and the quality of the provisions was generally very good as well.

Here are my thoughts about the restaurants I was able to sample board Norwegian Prima:

Hudson's

Ambiance: Average; tables were too close together.

Rushed; no chit-chat with the waitress. Food: Menu looked good but none of the items we ordered spoke to us; salads were ho-hum and the beef Wellington lacked flavor.

It's important to note that Norwegian Cruise Line fundamentally changed the definition of a cruise ship main dining room with Prima.

NCL has killed the tradition of a banquet hall with a menu that changes daily. Instead it's taking more of a specialty dining approach on its newest ship and Hudson's the main dining room on board features a set menu that doesn't change.

In reality this doesn't much matter on a ship with as many restaurants as Prima. I've found on many recent cruises that I rarely opted for the main dining room and instead relied on specialty restaurants the buffet and room service. The flexibility of the other options was too much of a draw for me. I did have dinner at Hudson's on this voyage and while it was fine I wouldn't make an effort to return.

I normally sail ships where all restaurants are included or on larger mainstream ships I book a suite to have access to the VIP option reserved for passengers booked in that category. On this ship passengers in the VIP Haven part of the ship have their own private restaurant.

For everyone else Norwegian Prima has six restaurants included in the fare eight extra-free restaurants and room service. I love the added flexibility of more choices at mealtime but it's sad to think some cruisers will miss out on these spots due to the extra fee.

If food isn't a motivating factor for some people though why should they pay a premium for the type of food that isn't what they truly want? I get the appeal of a ship that has many free dining options as well as upgraded for-fee restaurants.

Onboard activities

On small ships and luxury vessels onboard activities trend more toward lectures from a visiting anthropologist wine tastings and cooking demonstrations. I love those sorts of intimate gatherings where you feel like you're in a friend's living room and not on a giant cruise ship.

Norwegian Prima has much more lively options. I'll admit that I wouldn't necessarily seek out several of the pastimes aboard Prima but a few of the ship's offerings — such as the multi-deck go-kart track and virtual reality gaming center — intrigued me. I'm not a gambler so I don't miss the lack of a casino aboard smaller luxury ships. But for many the casino aboard Prima is a go-to spot.

On smaller ships entertainment is often limited to a DJ four-piece band or duo. Norwegian Prima offered a comedy club and a gorgeous theater with Broadway-style shows. That's compelling for people who want a more robust slate of evening entertainment options.

A glance at Norwegian Prima reveals the two 10-story slides on this ship: The Drop free-fall version and The Rush (Deck 18). The Wave the first tidal wave waterslide according to NCL is on Deck 19. That's too much adrenaline for me but our friends took the plunge and had a blast.

Then there's the multideck Prima Speedway for your go-kart fix. This is a paid experience at $15 a pop.

We had fun tackling the ship's mini-golf course Tee Time on Deck 18. Groups were having fun nearby at The Bull's Eye as they played a round of darts.

If you're traveling with children Deck 18's Kids' Aqua Park looked like oodles of fun — especially on a hot sunny day. Alternatively kids could spend time at the Splash Academy kids club.

The fitness center was well-equipped but seemed a bit snug for a ship this size.

Comfortable cabins

ANDREA ROTONDO/THE POINTS GUY

We sailed in a category B4 balcony stateroom. It was a bit snug. I would have loved a slightly larger space that could have accommodated a coffee table and an extended balcony that could fit loungers instead of two upright chairs and a cocktail table.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 ANDREA ROTONDO/THE POINTS GUY 0 1

In my opinion the bed needed a pillow-top mattress cover. It was too firm for me. I would have liked different pillows as well — one wasn't puffy enough but two were too bulky.

If you book a suite in The Haven there is a pillow menu feather duvets and Bliss Collection by Norwegian pillow-top mattresses.

ANDREA ROTONDO/THE POINTS GUY

The bathroom was the cabin's highlight. It was bright well-designed and roomy. Finally a shower where you won't bang your elbows on the walls as you wash your hair! And if you're plus size you won't feel squished as you get ready for the day.

One caveat: The ship provides body wash and a combined shampoo/conditioner in dispensers affixed to the wall. I would have liked separate shampoo and conditioner products and not one thing that was a combination of both so if you have the same preference be sure to bring yours from home.

Frictionless travel

Ocean Boulevard: a picturesque glass walkway on Deck 8. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE

I might have rolled my eyes the first time I heard the term ""frictionless travel."" All it means is that your experience getting from A to Z — and everything that happens in between — is simple and stress-free. Who doesn't want that?

In terms of frictionless cruising I look for:

Seamless airport- or hotel-to-ship transfers.

A simple screening process at the port (one that gets me on the ship in the shortest amount of time).

The ability to do the things I want when I want (dining at specific restaurants going ashore at the time of my choosing or experiencing an onboard amenity like Norwegian Prima's go-kart track).

Having my questions answered in a timely fashion and to the fullest extent so I can make the most of my vacation.

An easy way to disembark without waiting forever for a porter my luggage and onward transportation.

On previous luxury and small-ship cruises embarkation has been a breeze. On many occasions I've gotten out of a taxi at a port passed through the port's security screening walked up the gangway and was escorted to my suite in less than 30 minutes ... no lines no waiting for a boarding group to be called no waiting for my cabin to be ready for me.

Of course Norwegian Prima is much larger than the average luxury cruise ship. So how much friction should you expect on your Prima sailing? That's hard for me to say categorically since I was on an industry-only three-night sailing.

I can tell you that check-in at PortMiami was efficient. We arrived at Norwegian's new Terminal B at 10:45 a.m. After a few minutes in line we had our photos taken secured our room keys and were placed in boarding group 12. We were onboard by 11:15 a.m. (VIPs like guests booked in the suite section of the ship called The Haven get priority boarding. If you want the best embarkation and debarkation experience book in The Haven.)

We went straight to book our specialty dining reservations. We wanted to try Palomar but it was already completely booked. We opted for Le Bistro but had to dine earlier than we would have preferred. On a regular sailing you'd have the opportunity to book your specialty dining reservations before embarkation.

You will also want to book your entertainment activities as early as you can too ... whether that's a spa treatment a few laps around Prima Speedway virtual reality experiences at The Galaxy Pavilion or the evening musical or comedy show. If you're the type who likes to do things on the fly you may be disappointed. Planning out those activities in advance is your best bet on Prima.

Of course mainstream cruise lines aren't the only ones that have capacity issues when it comes to dining entertainment and shore excursion reservations. Elites on many cruise lines get first crack at those reservations so sometimes you'll be shut out whether you're trying to book the comedy show aboard Norwegian Prima or a specific dining experience on Regent's Seven Seas Explorer.

Disembarkment wasn't frictionless but again this was a unique sailing. Still my experience convinced me that The Haven — with its priority disembarkation — would be worth the price if I were to bring my family on a voyage with me.

Service

Excellent service means different things to different people. I want attentive service that feels warm friendly and authentic (i.e. the crew wants to be on the ship and enjoy working with passengers). A happy crew equals happy passengers. I don't want anything that's too formal snooty or uptight.

I want my preferences remembered — whether that's at the pool bar (where I will request fun frozen drinks without any alcohol) in the main dining room (where I appreciate recommendations that fall within my previously communicated dietary restrictions) or in my stateroom (where I want the minibar stocked with diet Coke and bitter lemon).

If there is a service issue I want the ability to speak with someone who can make it right — and have that conversation as soon as realistically possible.

How did the ship do on all of those counts? Very well actually.

Norwegian Prima's crew consists of genuine people who truly care about your vacation. It was easy to strike up conversations with crewmembers across the ship and everyone wanted to please — even if there was still a bit of training to be done. A new ship always has a few kinks to work out but I was very pleased with the crew who I believe will grow into an incredible team.

I would say that service in the specialty restaurants needs to slow down a bit. It was quick and efficient but for a dining experience that is so good it would be nice for a little more time built in for chitchat with the waitstaff. At Hudson's Norwegian Prima's equivalent of a main dining room service was friendly and fast but the buzz in the room didn't lend itself to lingering over dessert and coffee.

The ship could use more signage and upon embarkation and disembarkation more direction from the crew would be welcome.

Bottom line

Norwegian Prima exceeded my expectations in many ways — most especially in the sheer beauty of the public spaces and the quality of the specialty dining experiences. I appreciated the innovation of Indulge Food Hall.

I enjoyed all the bells and whistles that you may not find on luxury ships such as the go-kart track mini-golf course dart games infinity pools and live entertainment like ""The Donna Summer Musical."" The crew was kind and efficient and that goes a long way toward making a cruise great.

If I were to sail with my family I'd book a suite in The Haven which offers among other things:

Private VIP-only spaces on the ship: private pool hot tubs sundeck hot tub and fitness area.

Finnish sauna and cold room.

24/7 butler service.

Help from a concierge to book dining activity reservations and shore excursions.

Priority when reserving dining and entertainment preferences.

Complimentary room service.

Special Haven dining room and lounge.

Skip-the-line at embarkation at ports and at disembarkation with the assistance of a ship escort.

In the end I do think that luxury cruisers can love Norwegian Prima — or at least come darn close — especially if they select the ship for a multigeneration vacation or a friends' getaway where travel companions will want different sorts of activities throughout the day and evening.

Just book in The Haven to get an exclusive experience more akin to what you're accustomed to on smaller more upscale ships.

But the newlyweds didn’t get married on the island… they got married above it!

Thomas and Nancy Budzyn were wed at the top of Royal Caribbean’s Up Up and Away helium balloon at Perfect Day at CocoCay. While weddings on a cruise are nothing new this may be the most unique cruise wedding we’ve seen yet!

The Up Up and Away helium balloon at Royal Caribbean’s private island takes guests 450 feet in the air for 360 degree views of this Bahamian paradise. As the highest vantage point in the entire Bahamas the helium balloon provides a view of the island like no other.

On December 9 2022 two Royal Caribbean cruisers were married on the helium balloon. We wanted to learn more about their special day.

The newlyweds

Thomas and Nancy Budzyn live in Naples Florida and are frequent Royal Caribbean cruisers both of whom hold Diamond Plus status in the Crown & Anchor Society.

While the pair had met years ago their relationship as a couple began after the cruising restart and they took their first cruise together in July 2021. As the two both work remotely they can cruise often and have been on thirteen cruises together since the restart.

I couldn’t help but ask how the idea of getting married on the Up Up and Away helium balloon came to be.

“We have been to CocoCay so many times together and always have a great time” Thomas mentioned. “Plus it’s so beautiful there. It just seemed like the perfect place to have our perfect day.”

Thomas and Nancy were the first couple to get married in the balloon although another couple had previously gotten engaged there!

“Everyone always does the same thing. We wanted to do something different and hopefully be trendsetters.”

After a trial run in the balloon during a cruise over Thanksgiving Thomas and Nancy were ready to return in a few weeks for their special day.

The ceremony

One of the main issues with the Up Up and Away helium balloon at Perfect Day at CocoCay is that rides are weather dependent. Weather conditions must be ideal–with very little wind and no rain–for the helium balloon to run.

Thomas explained how this was a potential issue for their special day.

“The only concern was the wind as that could cause the balloon not to go up. We were mentally prepared for a last-minute venue change either the wedding pavilion or somewhere on the beach.”

Luckily their wedding day brought sunny blue skies. They were notified 30 minutes before the ceremony that the balloon ride would take place.

The ceremony was small with six attendees: the couple the island’s Entertainment Manager the balloon operator the officiant (Nancy’s best friend) and another friend that took photos. The Up Up and Away helium balloon can accommodate thirty people in total.

“The balloon ride is short” Thomas said. “The whole thing from boarding to unboarding was around 12 minutes. We had a short simple ceremony to fit within the time constraint.”

After the wedding

After the ceremony the wedding party headed over to Oasis Lagoon and each had the island’s signature drink the Coco Loco. They took several photos on the bridge over the lagoon before heading back to the ship.

A private tram escorted the newlyweds back to Symphony of the Seas where they took a few photos with the island’s dancers and band.

Once back onboard Thomas and Nancy headed to the casino (a little post-wedding luck perhaps?) before enjoying champagne and cake.

Thomas mentioned how the staff was excellent during the planning process and wedding ceremony.

“The staff were all just as excited as we were. The crew both on the island and on the ship made us feel like they were part of our wedding and our family.”

The only caveat with getting married at Perfect Day at CocoCay? The heat.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

You're not getting my vote"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvaHVudGVyLWJpZGVuLWd1bi1jaGFyZ2VzLTAwMTU3MTYw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge denies Hunter Biden's bid to dismiss gun charges,"Federal law bars people who use illegal drugs from buying guns. Biden’s team however argued in court that this ban violates the Second Amendment. They pointed to a recent Supreme Court decision New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen which constrained the government’s power to regulate gun ownership.

Judge Maryellen Noreika however was unpersuaded. Norieka who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump noted that while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the drug-user ban to be unconstitutional in one situation — specifically as applied to a habitual marijuana user — that court explicitly emphasized that its decision was quite narrow. And she wrote that the “vast majority” of district courts who have reviewed the drug-user ban in the post-Bruen world have upheld it as constitutional.

She added that Biden can still challenge the constitutionality of the statute as it was applied to him once his trial is complete.

In a separate ruling also handed down on Thursday Noreika ruled against a motion Biden had filed seeking documents the Justice Department possesses involving communications between or among Donald Trump former Attorney General William Barr and other Trump-era senior department officials regarding the Biden case.

Earlier Thursday a three-judge panel on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the president’s son on a separate group of motions. Biden had sought to have the charges against him dismissed for several other reasons arguing he was the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution and that a pretrial diversion agreement he and prosecutors both signed last summer bars the government from charging him.

The federal judges ruled that Biden cannot make those arguments until after his trial is completed. Abbe Lowell his lead defense lawyer said in a statement that the team will appeal the panel’s decision.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL3JlZ2lvbmFsL3dpbGtpbnNidXJnLWFubmV4YXRpb24tZmFpbHVyZS1yZWZsZWN0cy1tZXJnZXItaHVyZGxlcy1mb3ItcGEtcy0yNTYwLW11bmljaXBhbGl0aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wilkinsburg annexation failure reflects merger hurdles for Pa.'s 2560 municipalities,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://triblive.com/local/regional/wilkinsburg-annexation-failure-reflects-merger-hurdles-for-pa-s-2560-municipalities/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL3JlZ2lvbmFsL3dpbGtpbnNidXJnLWFubmV4YXRpb24tZmFpbHVyZS1yZWZsZWN0cy1tZXJnZXItaHVyZGxlcy1mb3ItcGEtcy0yNTYwLW11bmljaXBhbGl0aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc2hvcHBpbmcvc2FicmluYS1lbGJhLXNhYmxlLWxhYnMtc2tpbi1jYXJlLW5ldy1wcm9kdWN0cy0xMjM1ODk1NzgwL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc2hvcHBpbmcvc2FicmluYS1lbGJhLXNhYmxlLWxhYnMtc2tpbi1jYXJlLW5ldy1wcm9kdWN0cy0xMjM1ODk1NzgwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sabrina Elba Opens Up About A-Beauty Skin Care Line S’Able Labs: “African Ingredients Are So Powerful”,"If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

CRM,Salesforce,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8xOC9zYWxlc2ZvcmNlLWVuZHMtMjAyMi1pbi1hbi11bnVzdWFsbHktdHVyYnVsZW50LXBvc2l0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salesforce ends 2022 in an unusually turbulent position,"When Salesforce announced during its most recent earnings call that it wouldn’t be providing a revenue forecast for next year it was a bit of a shock especially coming from the most successful SaaS company in the world.

With revenue of over $7.8 billion for the quarter and a goal of reaching $50 billion by its fiscal 2026 the company hasn’t exactly been doing poorly. Still when you combine the lack of a forecast with the recent executive exodus it begins to paint a picture of unusual instability at the CRM giant.

First let’s look at that forecast — or the lack of one. It seems the economy has become so uncertain that Salesforce opted out of a forecast for its fiscal 2024 altogether (the three months ending October 31 2022 comprised the third quarter of the company’s fiscal 2023). We use the word unprecedented these days an awful lot but it’s pretty darn unusual for a company like Salesforce to tell investors they’re punting on a forecast and it’s the first time the CRM giant has ever done it.

Here’s what Salesforce CFO Amy Weaver told investors during the earnings call:

Before I close I’d like to share a few thoughts on Fiscal Year ‘24. As discussed we are experiencing a very unpredictable macro environment as our customers are working to ensure their businesses are also healthy for the long term. Compounding that dynamic is an unprecedented foreign currency market. Therefore at this time we believe it would be premature to provide revenue guidance for the next fiscal year.

That would be enough to make anyone who has followed this company raise their eyebrows. But consider that Salesforce simultaneously dropped the bombshell that co-CEO Bret Taylor plans to step down.

The reason for that exit ostensibly was that Taylor was tired of life inside the big corporation and wanted to return to his roots as a company builder — to get back to basics in other words. But that might not have been the whole story. The Wall Street Journal reported tension between the two leaders and that the resignation might not have come as far out of left field as we were led to believe. (You can pull your jaw off the floor; this is not the first time a company has tried to spin bad news as neutral.)

There were other shoes left to drop. The smaller of the two clogs was Mark Nelson CEO at Tableau announcing he was leaving. (Salesforce bought Tableau back in 2019). The more dramatic news item quickly followed: Slack co-founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield told his flock that he wanted to spend less time running a business and more time gardening and taking care of his child.

Slack quickly announced that Lidiane Jones who had been GM of Salesforce’s Commerce Cloud Marketing Cloud and Experience Cloud (yes that’s a lot of clouds) would replace Butterfield.

Let’s not forget that even prior to all of this Salesforce had to deal with activist investor Starboard Value breathing down its neck never a comfortable position. (The company stressed its cost-cutting efforts in its latest quarterly call it’s worth noting.)

On paper that feels like a lot of disturbing news in a short time. But what does it mean to the underlying financial stability of the company? As part of our year-end roundup at TechCrunch+ we decided to take a peek under the hood and see what’s happening. Is this a short-term glitch in a bad year for all SaaS companies or a series of moves that could be indicative of something more worrisome at Salesforce?

Inside the numbers

We have three goals: First to look at Salesforce’s recent quarterly performance to see what we can infer about its health. Second to wonder whether other companies are reporting similar results and forecasts. And third to ask if there is a lesson here for us technology watchers especially regarding startups.

In the third quarter of its fiscal 2023 Salesforce reported 14% growth (19% in constant currency terms) to revenue of $7.84 billion. Against $2.1 billion in revenue costs the CRM company generated gross profits of $5.7 billion (73% gross margins) operating income of $460 million and net income of $210 million in the three-month period. Compared to the year-ago quarter Salesforce’s operating income was up sharply from $38 million while its net income dipped from a year-ago result of $468 million.

Apart from what appears to be a rapid deceleration in revenue expansion the company is hardly in dire straits. Salesforce had nearly $12 billion in cash and equivalents on hand at the end of its most recent quarter and remaining performance obligations worth $40.0 billion.

The most significant concern with Salesforce’s numbers is growth deceleration from 22% in the preceding quarter and 27% in the year-ago period unadjusted for currency fluctuations which it expects to slow to 8% to 10% in the current period. Put more simply Salesforce had to deal with currency-related growth speed bumps in the quarter. At the same time customers are holding back on new purchases or spending more with existing technology vendors.

While they probably can’t cut existing expenditures — that’s the beauty of subscription SaaS revenue — they can forgo new purchases and upsells which could help account for the lower revenue projections beyond currency issues everyone is dealing with.

Why does the lack of guidance for next year matter? Because it implies that Salesforce needed more time to understand its market. For a SaaS company that’s a bit of a surprise; subscription software companies are known for revenue stability and forecastable growth rates. For Salesforce — with all the historical data it has under its belt — to need more time to project was perhaps unsettling to investors.

The company’s share price closed on November 30 ahead of earnings at $160.25 per share. It closed at $128.27 Friday implying that investors are less certain that Salesforce is accreting new future cash flows. (Even worse its per-share price peaked at over $300 in November 2021 and it has since had to deal with aforementioned activist investors probably as a result.)

Our first goal was to understand Salesforce’s health. It’s perfectly fine even if it’s enduring the growth crunch that all SaaS companies are dealing with right now.

Other companies and the dollar problem

Now are other modern software companies seeing their growth rate moderate? Yes. A good example is Box which we’ve covered extensively in recent quarters but also the broader cloud market. Per Bessemer data the median growth rate for a public cloud company accelerated from 2020 lows of 26% to 27% to a peak of around 34% to 35% in the early 2022 calendar year. Since that May-ish zenith median growth has dipped to 26% in recent weeks.

Salesforce is not alone then in seeing growth slow. In fact our working perspective is that the more revenues from other countries a U.S. software company has the more likely it is suffering from currency-related growth issues. For example in Salesforce’s most recent quarter it reported $1.75 billion worth of revenue up 10% in normal terms. That would’ve been 23% if the value of the dollar hadn’t jumped in recent quarters. That growth deficit is brutal.

This brings us to our third question: Is there a lesson to be had from the Salesforce quarter its falling value and the fact that it told investors that it won’t provide a fiscal 2024 forecast until the end of its current quarter? There is and it’s actually good news.

Yes Salesforce’s growth is slowing in constant currency terms. Yes other companies are enduring a similar problem (Microsoft posted 11% growth in its most recent quarter or 16% in constant currency terms for example) but there’s a positive trend in the offing that could help all such impacted companies: The dollar is losing some of its steam.

Tracking the U.S. Dollar Index throughout 2022 we can see a strengthening of the U.S. currency compared to other major currencies from the January-February period through October. Since then the dollar has lost material ground compared to other currencies. This could imply that the third quarter (calendar) might wind up being the worst quarter for tech companies that sell overseas at least from a growth perspective when we consider the impact of the changing value of currencies.

The weakening dollar helps explain Salesforce’s choice to delay its guidance; if the dollar was weakening and your growth rate was accelerating wouldn’t you also want a bit more time to track the change and work it into your projections? After all investors are hardly chill at the moment — why spook them?

Currency reversions won’t save the domestic economy of course. If Salesforce sees its U.S. growth rate decline any gain from more favorable forex conditions abroad won’t be able to close that gap we reckon. This means that while Salesforce’s — and other tech companies’ — growth rates may be under less pressure the larger question on the horizon remains unresolved.

The cloud still hangs over tech then but with some potentially good macro movements underway to help clear near-term currency-related pressures. For startups the moment makes it difficult to know where to invest be it domestically where the dollar’s changing value doesn’t matter much or abroad to possibly de-risk a U.S. recession. Getting that bet right could set the tone for all of next year.

Benioff asked ""Are we not building tribal knowledge with new employees without an office culture?"" in a message first reported by CNBC. Benioff reportedly followed up by attempting to soften the question's intensity with a joking ""asking for a friend"" smiley angel emoji.

According to CNBC Benioff emphasized that it was ""an issue that he said was affecting employees who joined Salesforce this year and last."" It was clear that the productivity problem might be partly related to the nature of widespread remote work which has become much more common due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a statement to CNBC a company spokesperson said that Salesforce has ""a hybrid work environment that empowers leaders and teams to work together with purpose. They can decide when and where they come together to collaborate innovate and drive customer success.""

Salesforce like many companies has been contending with a weakening economy CNBC notes as well as departures by C-Suite execs such as the imminent departure of Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield.

Benioff's message reportedly prompted numerous responses many positive. Still he was unhappy it became public saying in part that he hoped employees would ""agree it is also disappointing that our private conversations here were almost immediately given to the public media.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25leWNvbnRyb2wuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRzL3NhbGVzZm9yY2UtY2VvLXNheXMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLWhpcmVkLWR1cmluZy1wYW5kZW1pYy1oYXZlLW11Y2gtbG93ZXItcHJvZHVjdGl2aXR5LTk3MjIwNDEuaHRtbNIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25leWNvbnRyb2wuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRzL3NhbGVzZm9yY2UtY2VvLXNheXMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLWhpcmVkLWR1cmluZy1wYW5kZW1pYy1oYXZlLW11Y2gtbG93ZXItcHJvZHVjdGl2aXR5LTk3MjIwNDEuaHRtbC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salesforce CEO says employees hired during pandemic have ‘much lower productivity’,"Marc Benioff may be recognising the challenges presented by remote work (Image: Reuters)

Marc Benioff the chief executive of software company Salesforce said that employees hired during the pandemic have “much lower productivity” than colleagues who joined before 2020.

In an internal Slack message sent to employees on Friday Benioff asked for suggestions on increasing productivity among the staff and especially among new hires.

Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad

“How do we increase the productivity of our employees at salesforce? New employees (hired during the pandemic in 2021 & 2022) are especially facing much lower productivity.” Benioff said according to a screenshot seen by news website SFGATE. “Is this a reflection of our office policy?”

He went on to ask for more feedback on company culture. “Are we not building tribal knowledge with new employees without an office culture? Are our managers not directly addressing productivity with their teams?” Benioff asked employees according to CNBC. “Is coming as a new employee to salesforce too overwhelming? Asking for a friend.”

Benioff’s remarks come shortly after the company laid off hundreds of employees last month amid slowing revenue growth. The message may point to the challenges presented by remote work even though Salesforce was among the first tech companies to tell staff they would not have to come back to office.

The Salesforce CEO’s remarks also stand in contrast to what he said last year in an interview with CNBC noting that employees were being productive working from home. “You’re really starting see some very low attendance numbers in offices because employees are so productive at home” said Benioff. “They can do their job at home. They can be successful from anywhere. The companies and our customers are successful.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3Mvc2FsZXNmb3JjZS1tYXJjLWJlbmlvZmYtdXMtc29mdHdhcmUtZ2lhbnQtcy1jZW8tc2F5cy1lbXBsb3llZXMtaGlyZWQtaW4tcGFuZGVtaWMtaGF2ZS1sb3dlci1wcm9kdWN0aXZpdHktMTAxNjcxMzQxMjYyNjA2Lmh0bWzSAakBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3NhbGVzZm9yY2UtbWFyYy1iZW5pb2ZmLXVzLXNvZnR3YXJlLWdpYW50LXMtY2VvLXNheXMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLWhpcmVkLWluLXBhbmRlbWljLWhhdmUtbG93ZXItcHJvZHVjdGl2aXR5LTEwMTY3MTM0MTI2MjYwNi1hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salesforce co-CEO says employees hired in pandemic have low productivity: Report,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3Mvc2FsZXNmb3JjZS1tYXJjLWJlbmlvZmYtdXMtc29mdHdhcmUtZ2lhbnQtcy1jZW8tc2F5cy1lbXBsb3llZXMtaGlyZWQtaW4tcGFuZGVtaWMtaGF2ZS1sb3dlci1wcm9kdWN0aXZpdHktMTAxNjcxMzQxMjYyNjA2Lmh0bWzSAakBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3NhbGVzZm9yY2UtbWFyYy1iZW5pb2ZmLXVzLXNvZnR3YXJlLWdpYW50LXMtY2VvLXNheXMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLWhpcmVkLWluLXBhbmRlbWljLWhhdmUtbG93ZXItcHJvZHVjdGl2aXR5LTEwMTY3MTM0MTI2MjYwNi1hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D8242CD30>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

As a result he ordered the quashing of an environmental permit issued by the EPA on June 9 2021 in favour of Schlumberger to permit it to construct a radioactive substances and materials storage and calibration facility at lot 1 Area X Houston on the East Bank of Demerara.

The High Court judge also declared that the decision of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to not conduct an environmental impact assessment into the effects of the construction of the facility was illegal ultra vires unreasonable irrational for breaching the Environmental Protection Act Cap.20:05.

At the conclusion of the almost 40 minute’s judgment Justice Harnanan also granted an injunction against the company to refrain from continuing the possession use and storage of radioactive chemicals at its Houston facility. The injunction is in place until the company can legally obtain a lawful permit under the EPA Act.

The ruling comes in light of a legal challenge brought against the EPA and Schlumberger-Guyana by residents of Houston.

Schlumberger one of ExxonMobil’s major subcontractors has constructed a source storage and calibration building facility Area X Houston EBD.

The favourable decision against the major ExxonMobil subcontractor is seen as a big win for citizens.

Residents—Danuta Radzik Vanda Radzik and Raphael Singh— filed an action asking the High Court to declare the EPA’s decision waiving the requirement of an EIA as being among other things unlawful and unreasonable.

During arguments the EPA said that permission was given for the construction of the facility and not for the operation of a radioactive substances and materials storage and calibration facility.

However the High Court Judge ruled the operation and construction must not be viewed separately. In the court’s view he said the EPA cannot treat the operations independent of the construction permit when it is a condition precedent to the functionality of the facility.

“The court is of the view that it could not have been the intention of the party to treat the operation as distinct from construction for the purpose of licensing since operations can only commence after construction” he said.

Justice Harnanan ruled further that the EPA body further breached its mandate as outlined in the EPA act when it took the decision to waive the EIA requirements. He stated that they failed to do so by failing to provide reasons behind the decision for a waiver.

In this regard he also quashed the EPA’s decision of the January 2020 award of an environmental authorisation.

The Radziks and Singh (the Applicants) via court filings had said that they live near the radioactive facility which is also in proximity to schools and places of worship. They contended that EPA’s decision was made without any consultation with residents.

Against this background they accused the Agency of having arbitrarily made the decision in breach of its statutory duty and contrary to natural justice. They said too that it was made in the absence of evidence was unfair and asked that the Court so declare.

They deposed in their fixed date application (FDA) against Schlumberger the EPA and the Environmental Assessment Board (EAB) which were all listed as Respondents that the waiver granted to Schlumberger was done without notice to the public.

They said there was no inkling that the facility would be used to store radioactive materials or that the request for such a permit was even under consideration. The Applicants said it was not until April 11th that the EPA issued a public notice via the press that Schlumberger wanted to construct a building to house the radioactive materials and that the construction process would not require an environmental impact assessment.

In the newspaper notice which is an exhibit in the case the EPA announced that in accordance with Section 11 (2) of the Environmental Protection Act Schlumberger-Guyana Inc.’s application for an environmental authorisation had been “screened” for “potential environmental impacts.”

According to the EPA following its assessment it had determined that the project would “not significantly affect the environment or human health” and that Schlumberger would therefore be exempt from requiring an EIA.

The applicants however questioned the basis on which the EPA arrived at its conclusion that an EIA would not be required. Their main contention was that radioactive materials should not be used and/or located in close proximity to schools neighbourhoods a main thoroughfare or the Demerara River and that an impact assessment was therefore inherently necessary.

Relying on Section 11 of the Environmental Protection Act the applicants noted that any project that may significantly affect the environment requires an EIA and such an assessment requires publication in the newspapers of the intended project and consultations with the public.

The Applicants said that the EPA at a meeting with them and their attorneys had assured that they would be given an opportunity to speak on the merits and demerits of the facility’s operation.

Subsequent to that meeting the applicants sought an Order of Certiorari to quash the permit granted to Schlumberger to construct the facility and an injunction to prevent any further construction.

The Applicants said that in a responding affidavit however the EPA in defence of Schlumberger said that construction of the facility was completed and that it had already permitted Schlumberger’s use and storage of the radioactive substances and that the orders sought by the Applicants should therefore be quashed.

Siand Dhurjon—one of the attorneys representing the applicants—has said that his clients had been granted an amendment by Justice Nareshwar Harnanan to seek orders targeting the operation of the facility being used for storage of radioactive materials.

Schlumberger the lawyer said had advanced in its affidavit that the reason the public did not need a notice that the EPA was considering its application for permit to store radioactive materials was because the EPA was satisfied that there would be no substantial impact on the environment.

Schlumberger was represented by law office of Hughes Fields and Stoby the EPA was represented by Shareefah Parks and Frances Carryl and the residents were represented by Dhurjon Ronald Burch-Smith and Malene Alleyne.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Research has uncovered evidence that the evolution of mammals began in the Southern Hemisphere not the Northern Hemisphere challenging hundreds of years of scientific dogma.

A staggering international breakthrough has led to a remarkable new understanding that all modern mammals including humans had their earliest beginnings in the Southern Hemisphere with some important developments occurring in Australia turning conventional wisdom on its head.

The major force behind this astounding development is renowned Aussie scientist Professor Tim Flannery an Honorary Associate at the Australian Museum in Sydney.

Tim who’s spent extensive time as a field biologist in remote corners of the planet discovering and naming scores of new species and has been instrumental in bringing the world’s attention to the perils of climate change has no doubt about the significance of this new breakthrough.

“I think it’s the most important piece of science from a global perspective that I’ve done in my lifetime” he told Australian Geographic.

Tim is supported by a group of international scientific luminaries including Professor Kris Helgen the Australian Museum’s Chief Scientist; Dr Tom Rich Senior Curator of Vertebrate Palaeontology with Museums Victoria; Dr Patricia Vickers-Rich a Professor of Paleontology at Monash University; and Dr Grace Veatch from the Smithsonian in the US.

Together this weighty band of experts has just published a paper in the scientific literature that’s likely to be seen as landmark in our understanding of life on Earth.

Appearing in Alcheringa: An Australian Journal of Palaeontology and entitled The Gondwanan Origin of Tribosphenida (Mammalia) it’s not likely to be fodder for conversation around office water bubblers.

But this paper will undoubtedly set off a flurry of emails texts and tweets across the globe among not only scientists interested in evolution but well beyond.

Ultimately it’s likely to see the rewriting of high school and university textbooks the world over.

Origins of a theory

To appreciate all this it’s important to understand there are three lines of mammals surviving on Earth today: the marsupials – the pouched mammals such as kangaroos and possums; the placental mammals which includes most of Earth’s well-known modern mammals including dogs cats mice and of course humans; and the monotremes – the weird egg-laying platypus and echidnas.

The scientific consensus has been for more than 200 years that the placentals and marsupials arose in the Northern Hemisphere and spread southwards. It’s called the Sherwin-Williams Effect. (Forget the monotremes for now: we’ve long-known they’re an odd ancient evolutionary offshoot that survives only in Australia and New Guinea and nothing has changed there.)

“But the question has always been what was the common ancestor that gave rise to all the placentals and marsupials? And where was that evolution happening?” Kris Helgen says.

Some sort of small shrew-like creature in Victoria it now seems played a crucial role.

Realising the truth

The extraordinary new scientific understanding about when and where modern mammals evolved came about initially when Tim and Kris two of the nation’s great scientific minds were forced during pandemic lockdowns to revisit treasure-troves of evidence that have been lying around in museums and the scientific literature for about two decades.

“I was re-analysing these fossils that turned up in Victoria from the age of dinosaurs” Tim explains. “And then I started looking more widely for similar sorts of fossils found elsewhere and it turned out all of them were in the southern hemisphere and all are Jurassic or Cretaceous in age [from 199–66 million years ago].”

“And we realised the thing that unites all these Southern Hemisphere fossils is they have these very strange complicated molars that let the animals puncture shear and crush all at the same time what they were eating” Tim says explaining these distinctive teeth probably evolved to deal with the tough chitinous shells of insect prey.

These odd teeth are described as tribosphenic and the mammals they occurred in are known as tribosphenidans.



Tribosphenic teeth. Image credit: James Alcock

The first Southern Hemisphere fossils of these teeth were found in an ancient jaw in 1997 by Tom Rich at a dig site now known as Flat Rocks near the Victorian seaside town of Inverloch which is also where Australia’s first dinosaur bone was found.

During the following 10 years similar tribosphenidan fossils were found in Madagascar and South America and then much later in India – all land masses that were once connected in the great southern supercontinent Gondwana. It’s these records Tim started to revisit and have deep discussions about with Kris Helgen.

People had looked at these scattered bits and pieces of information previously but never in a comprehensive way to see if they revealed any sort of pattern.

A new truth

There are plenty of fossils of early mammals across the Northern Hemisphere. But it’s only in these fossils of mammals which are older and only from the Southern Hemisphere that you first see these unique tribosphenic teeth.

“So we’ve been able to show that the relevant fossils that look like they are anatomically likely to be close to the common ancestor of marsupials and placentals are found exclusively in the southern continents and are from an older time period than the oldest mammal similar fossils seen in the north” Kris explains. “And that indicates these groups of mammals had their ancestry in the southern continents at an earlier time period and then later colonised the northern continents. It absolutely turns our previous understanding on its head.”

Tom Rich elaborates further: “The hypothesis we are presenting is that [marsupials and placentals] originated in Gondwana and then dispersed to the northern hemisphere about 120 million years ago.” That’s about the same age as the oldest Victorian fossils with these weird teeth and slightly older than the oldest mammal fossils found in the Northern Hemisphere.

“And if you do plate tectonic reconstructions one of the best possible routes north is from what’s now Victoria through to east Asia via a series of islands that existed at that time.”

So it’s thought these early mammal ancestors would have island hopped their way from land that’s now located on Victoria’s south coast northwards though Asia and across the rest of the world.

“Yes it looks to be incredible” agrees Tim. “I resisted the conclusion as long as I could but the evidence is compelling. These shrew-like animals from Australian are actually the ancestors of both the earliest placentals and the earliest marsupials.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Let’s Take Our Diamonds In The Rough And Give Them a Coat Of Polish

By Tina Traster

People ask me what I think about this or that all the time. They figure I know more than a bit about Rockland County. I’d like to modestly say that I have a fair sense of the county’s zeitgeist though no place is without its mystery.

As we wrap up 2022 we tend to take stock. Where does that project stand? Is that mall going to survive? Will the cinema remain open? Is anything ever going to get built on Nyack’s waterfront? Will Stony Point’s Letchworth stand ghostly for time eternal? These are some of the questions that arise as the wine and spanakopita is passed around at year-end soirees. During the final weeks of the year – amid the celebrations wind downs travel and anticipation of turning the page – we gather our thoughts. We take stock. We ponder what will it take to make our little corner of the globe a better place.

The good folks of the Village of Nyack for example continue to wonder how to better utilize its diamond-in-the-rough waterfront. The stalled TZ Vista development on Gedney Street along the Hudson River remains a black hole while a pair of developers remain locked in legal battles and the former River Club restaurant is still a vacant site waiting to be reinvented. Waterfront development kickstarts prosperity. In Nyack it’s stalled. The village tries in so many ways to utilize its assets – beautiful architecture a vibrant downtown restaurant scene more housing for younger people. But the waterfront piece is unmined treasure and that’s too bad.

On the waterfront in the Village of Haverstraw in contrast plans are afoot to transform the nine-acre former Chair Factory site with housing retail and a hotel. Kudos to the village for the initiative it’s taken to get a game-changing project jumpstarted.

Villages like Nyack or Suffern or Piermont benefit when they have a focal point. The loss of the Helen Hayes theater in Nyack left a void a cultural crater that if replaced with a theater or cinema somewhere in the village could be a strategic focal point for the village. Suffern has the historic Lafayette Theater a treasure that needs more exposure and buzz. We’ve recently learned how fragile our cinema-going opportunities may be here in the county when there was a chance that Regal would walk from The Shops at Nanuet. For now there is a reprieve and Simon Property Group and Cineworld are likely negotiating but a single-screen historic theater in a community is certainly a way to differentiate a village and build a movie-going culture around it.

Speaking of The Shops at Nanuet I’m often asked what will become of that outdoor mall? I don’t have a crystal ball and Simon is not especially transparent. I’m hoping Regal keeps the magic going but I do have some unsolicited advice for the folks at Simon. We see a new generation of retail coming to the outdoor mall – some hopeful some not so much. The new artisanal coffee shop Roast’d which replaced Starbucks indicates what is possible. But I believe Simon needs to be more than a passive mall filled with retail tenants a cinema and a gym. That mall has the unique advantage of being an outdoor venue and the pandemic taught us that we can really enjoy the outdoors in all seasons. Simon should think about robust programming that includes the arts music dance theater readings festivals food year-round and often– the kind of activities that draw crowds to have experiences that make us feel like the mall and its real estate is truly part of the community.

And if the property owners really wants to change up the equation why not use the fallow Sears building or the empty Macy’s floor or some part of the property for a brewery winery cidery or artisanal food or crafts market? Because guess what – that’s what draws scores of people especially younger people to a place. It becomes a focal point like a cinema in a village.

Speaking of magnets let me share a recent experience I had in New Canaan CT. I visited Grace Farm an 80-acre former horse farm that was saved by a foundation and transformed into a gorgeous public space with stunning pods of glass and wood buildings that serve the public interest. There is a café tea house library exhibition space and an ethereal indoor amphitheater where free concerts are held. I visited this slice of paradise recently and wished so much that Rockland County had a place like this – both a sanctuary and yet a space to commune with others. I thought about this property and its spectacular architecture and it brought to mind the rotting HNA (former IBM site) on Route 9W in Palisades that the Town of Orangetown now has a hand in. I recognize that a project like Grace Farm calls for philanthropy and fundraising and all the elements that bring projects like this to bear – but in the end they drive people to the area to the downtowns to the artists and vendors who work on site.

Focal points or unique places to gather enrich and enliven our lives. We want walkability craft products good culture and great stewardship of land that still has the potential to be something other than another big box warehouse or drive-thru. Maybe it’s a lot to wish for but hey isn’t that what we do when we count down to a new year? Happy New Year Rocklanders.

A nationwide cold spell accompanied by heavy snow and biting winds which has sparked travel chaos in many parts of the nation is expected to continue through this week according to the state weather agency.



The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) said morning lows in Seoul plummeted to minus 12 degrees Celsius on Sunday marking the coldest weather this season with wind-chill temperatures measured at minus 21 degrees.



Other parts of the nation ― including the relatively warm regions on the southern resort island of Jeju ― also saw freezing temperatures between minus 15 and minus one degree.



Heavy snow advisories were issued on Saturday in most parts of the nation including Incheon Daejeon Gwangju Metropolitan cities as well as South Chungcheong Province and the mountainous areas of Jeju Island.

For us to reach the southern terminus of the hike that journey was over 31 hours: 4 plane journeys 8 plane meals and an extensive movie-watching session later we were literally as far away from Nottingham United Kingdom as we could get and we were ready to go!

Coming out of the airport at Invercargill we stuck our thumbs out and 20 seconds later we were in a pickup truck with a guy called Bret (present) who dropped us at the local supermarket Countdown. A resupply and a second hitch with a coach driver later we were ready to get our first few miles of the TA under our belt. We hiked about 5 miles to the southernmost point where the trip starts got our picture and headed a the campsite in Bluff. Half an hour later we were both sound asleep.

Life’s a beach

After heading back to Invercargill it was time for a day on the beach. Twenty-odd miles of beach walking does test weary office legs quickly and by the time we got to Riverton we were tired. A combination of jet lag a cold from the airplane air and a hard day meant we welcomed the soft furnishings of the Riverton camping lounge.

For this trip we’ve decided to take on roles rather than planning as we go. Jenny has a focus on diet the prestigious title of chief nutritional officer (CNO) whilst Joal (executive director of strategy and operations) will focus on logistics of which there are many especially as we need to coordinate with friends who will be joining us. The aim for Jenny is to get at least one fresh item into the meal plan each day whilst Joal’s focus is to make sure we enjoy the hike know how many days there are between towns and plan the mileage for each day.

From Riverton we did another morning along the coast before the track headed up and into the hills.

The roller coaster gold rush track.

As we headed into the hills we entered what was once a thriving gold rush area. The tracks and runs now leave a roller coaster style path that sucks dives and winds its way up the mountain. The higher we went up the tricker the track got with blowdowns and mud starting to become more and more prominent. Our speed slowed to a crawl as we navigated obstacles balanced across rivers and branches and crawled under huge downed trees. By 7pm we were at the historical Martin’s Hut. “Hurrah” exclaimed Jenny as we got close to which the door magically threw itself open. Inside we met a New Zealand hiker who after an aneurysm on day 2 was back on trail. Tired legs and minds from a day’s gymnastics meant conversation was minimal. After ramen and mushroom we were tucked into our bunks. The next morning with our hiker friend already gone we turned to each other as we woke and said in chorus “You were snoring pretty heavily last night.” Hopefully we didn’t keep Twyzel up!

The day Joal’s phone died

Day 4 was our biggest test. Seventeen miles from Martin’s Hut to Merrivale Hut seemed like it would be a day we would take in our stride. Mostly downhill and five miles of forest road all pointed to a day that wouldn’t be too hard on the body. Day 4 instead taught us humility.

Thinking it would be cruisy we had a chilled breakfast and we were ready to get going at about 9.00. We set off and about a mile from the hut went to go and send a check in text using our satellite phone. We don’t know how but the battery was completely dead despite being at 60% last night.

We rummaged for the USB C cable but couldn’t find it. So I dropped my pack and headed back to the hut. Still no sign of the cable. So that was a dead satellite phone and a potentially worried parent playing on our mind – the time now was about 10.00.

The next two miles were uphill through thick bog. We took about two hours to get to the top of the hill which opened into a clearing. By this point it was bucketing it down. We pushed through thinking we still had 15 miles to go for the day. This is where mistake two came to play. I had my raincoat on but must not have had the zips fully done up. After 40 minutes in I took out my phone as I’d lost the waypoints of the trail. My raincoat pocket had let in some water and my phone felt a little soggy. On closer inspection the situation was worse still my supposedly waterproof iPhone 12 was sputtering to a slow death!

We pushed on as the icy cold wind and rain drove sideways against our exposed legs hands and faces. This was one of the coldest I’ve ever been and also the most worried I’ve been on trail. I had my puffy in my bag and my gloves but stubbornly hadn’t stopped as I was already cold. This was a silly move and I was now shaking uncontrollably. Two miles later we were back to thick mud. I can’t truly describe how this mud is but it sucks you in if you misstep. At one point I was up to my bum both feet stuck in the mud. The only way out was to lean back and push back off the grass verge I’d descended from.

It took us over five hours to hike five miles and we were cold soaked through and in low spirits. When the option of stopping and eating hot food and coffee in a more sheltered spot was suggested I pounced on it – even though we were less than a third of the mileage through the day. Reflecting on the morning at this break I felt foolish. It was one of those moments you see on TV where one bad decision leads to another. I had visions of a rescue crew coming across a Hawaiian shirt clad shorts wearing couple who had a satellite phone which was out of battery warm clothes in their bag but foolishly were unprepared for the elements.

The rest of the day was a cakewalk compared to the morning. That said it still took us till 9.30pm to get to our next camp where Twyzel who we had shared the cabin the day before with was already in his sleeping bag. “What time do you call this?” he said sternly before breaking the act with “was mega shit aye!!”



What a difference a day makes





Seventeen miles – the same as the day before. Yet two days that couldn’t be more different. Despite a few showers of rain the day was a cruisy one. We enjoyed lunch in the sun before heading to Birchwood Station where a car picked us up for dinner and a resupply. Here we downloaded all the maps to Jen’s phone as Joal’s was still dead. This was the first time using Elon’s new fangled star-link and it was blazingly fast – all maps downloaded in under a minute! As the owner of the pub drove us back he was waxing lyrical about its benefits to the community being connected to super fast internet. Something we take for granted.



We spent the night in an old cabin on a working farm allowing us to dry our sodden clothes above a log burner.

NEW ALBANY Ind. — A distilled spirits bottling facility in Southern Indiana is getting a $78 million expansion bringing up to 50 new jobs to the area.

Sazerac Northwest Ordinance Distilling is expanding it's New Albany production facility for the third time in three years according to a One Southern Indiana press release.

The former General Mills Pillsbury plant located at 707 Pillsbury Lane was purchased in June of 2018 with a $39.5 million expansion in 2020 that resulted in the addition of 50 full-time employees and a $49 million expansion in 2021 creating the same number of positions.

This new $78 million expansion will include $25 million in building improvements and $53 million in four new processing and bottling lines bringing the total number of lines at the New Albany facility to 14.

The expansion will better allow the company to meet market demand and will result in the addition of up to 50 full-time employees over four years.

James Hartman plant general manager said he's excited the company will create steady good-paying jobs in Floyd County.

“As Sazerac enters its next phase of growth the Northwest Ordinance Distilling processing and bottling plant has the capacity and scalability that make it ideally positioned for investment and job creation to address production growth to meet demand"" Hartman said.

Jones has been a go-to legal expert for court appointments as a special master or independent monitor in complex disputes.

She's also had a long and varied legal career on and off the bench:

The National Football League and its players association assigned her to determine whether the punishment the league imposed on one of its star running backs had been excessive.

Federal judges tapped Jones for assignments to determine whether electronic material the FBI seized from two lawyers for former President Donald Trump and a conservative investigative group was protected by the First Amendment or legal or constitutional privileges.

She also presided over similarly high-profile and complex cases during her 16 years as a federal trial court judge in the Southern District of New York. The list includes the trial of a telecom executive charged in a massive accounting fraud case that sank his company and a case that ultimately led to a landmark Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage.

Now Jones faces what may be her most difficult assignment so far - serving as the court-appointed monitor for some financial decisions by the Trump Organization. The appointment includes submissions of financial disclosures and asset valuations to outside parties and overseeing any restructuring or disposition of significant assets.

Her appointment has come as Trump is seeking the Oval Office again amid a number of cases investigations and other legal challenges for the former president and his businesses.

Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide

Jones was appointed by the judge who's presiding over a massive civil lawsuit by the New York Attorney General's Office that accuses Trump his companies and his three oldest children of tax fraud and other charges. However both sides in the case have agreed that Ivanka Trump's finances would not be monitored by Jones.

The case focuses on charges that Trump overstated his financial assets to win lower rates from lenders and insurers than he otherwise would have received.

The Trumps have denied the allegations and argued that a monitor would interfere with Trump Organization operations. They have challenged Jones' appointment as a monitor to a New York state appeals court.

Before they dropped a request to delay the appointment pending the appeal the Trumps argued in court papers that the monitor appointment ""ignores established law .. grants an immediate and unlawful prejudgment restraint on nearly $5 billion in assets ... and imposes vague and onerous requirements.""

Attorneys and others who have known Jones or been involved in legal matters she handled say the former federal judge and prosecutor is the ideal choice for the high stakes of the Trump assignment.

""There are very few people like her who have top legal credentials and are non-partisan"" said Michael Cherkasky executive chairman of Exiger and a former prosecutor who knows Jones from years ago when they worked in then-Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau's office.

""She was a good prosecutor she was a good judge she's good on the law and she is fair"" said Cherkasky.

Early life and career

Born in Inglewood California Jones earned her undergraduate degree from Mount St. Mary's College in Los Angeles. She received her law degree in 1973 from Temple University.

Jones' early legal career focused on fighting organized crime.

She served as a special attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division an assignment focused on organized crime and racketeering. Jones next spent several years as an assistant federal prosecutor in the Organized Crime Strike Force based in the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office. She ultimately became the unit's chief.

That experience brought her to the attention of Morgenthau who appointed her as his chief assistant district attorney.

Initially ""she was an outsider"" in the legendary prosecutor's office said Cherkasky who was Morgenthau's chief of investigations at the time. ""But her experience and clear ability made her part of the team.""

On the bench

In 1995 President Bill Clinton nominated Jones for the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York. The Senate easily confirmed her nomination with a voice vote.

It was Jones who presided over the 2005 trial of Bernard Ebbers the chief of telecommunications giant WorldCom who was accused in one of the largest corporate accounting scandals in U.S. history.

WorldCom collapsed into bankruptcy in 2002 amid allegations of an $11 billion accounting fraud that included company executives pressuring employees to inflate the firm's financial data.

When Ebbers was convicted in 2005 Jones sentenced him to a 25-year prison term. An ailing Ebbers died in 2020 roughly one month after he was released early.

Of the scores of other cases Jones ruled on during her 16-year judicial tenure one inarguably stands out.

Edith Windsor was angry after she had to pay $363053 in federal estate taxes to the Internal Revenue Service after the 2009 death of her wife clinical psychologist Thea Spyer. After living together for 40 years the couple had married in Canada in 2007.

But Windsor was blocked by the Defense of Marriage Act a 1996 statute that barred federal government recognition of same-sex marriage partners as spouses. That meant Windsor who inherited Spyer's estate had no legal right to receive the estate tax-free as would have been routine for any heterosexual marriage.

So she sued for a refund arguing that the differential treatment under the law violated the Constitution.

Jones' 2012 decision in the case concluded that the portion of the Defense of Marriage Act that had ensnared Windsor was unconstitutional.

""The statute creates a federal definition of marriage. But that definition does not give content to the fundamental right to marry - and it is the substance of that right not its facial definition that actually shapes the institution of marriage"" wrote Jones.

In June 2013 the Supreme Court issued a 5-4 decision concluding the Defense of Marriage Act was an unconstitutional ""deprivation of the equal liberty of persons that is protected by the Fifth Amendment.""

James Esseks an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who worked on the case in the New York district court said Jones' ruling was ""courageous"" because public sentiment toward same-sex marriage at the time ""was not what it is today.""

""Judge Jones was somebody who looked at the law and the legal arguments and made a decision based on the law. And that's exactly what you want a judge to do"" said Esseks.

Private legal practice

Jones has taken a similar approach to the legal matters she's handled since she left the federal bench for private practice in 2013. She's currently a partner at law firm Bracewell LLP where she focuses her practice on special master and monitor assignments. Jones is also a board member of the International Association of Independent Court Monitors.

In 2013-14 she chaired the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Panel which examined sexual assaults in the military. The panel members spent months observing military installations examining current U.S. protocols for sexual assaults in the armed forces and holding public hearings.

The more than 100 recommendations in their final June 2014 report included one that said assessment of the problem could be improved through creation of a military crime victimization survey that would determine the ""actual number of unreported sexual assault crimes.""

Jones also got the call about a domestic abuse case that drew national attention.

In February 2014 Baltimore Ravens star running back Ray Rice struck his then-fiancée Janay Palmer inside an elevator of an Atlantic City hotel and casino. Palmer fell to the floor unconscious striking her head on the elevator rail during the fall.

Rice was indicted on a charge of felony assault. The case ended with an agreement that the charge would be dismissed after one year if Rice completed an anger management course attended counseling sessions and was not charged with new crimes.

Rice met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. He and other NFL officials had seen video from a surveillance camera that showed Rice dragging Palmer out of the elevator. And they knew that a second video had recorded what happened inside the elevator.

Goodell initially imposed a two-game suspension.

Then the video of the camera inside the elevator became public. It showed a graphic view of the assault and sparked public demands for tougher NFL action. Goodell imposed an indefinite suspension on Rice as the NFL said the athlete allegedly had misled Goodell.

Tapped as an arbitrator Jones investigated and ruled in Rice's favor. Writing that she was ""not persuaded that Rice lied to or misled the NFL"" Jones concluded the indefinite suspension was an abuse of discretion and ""must be vacated.""

Others have turned to Jones as a monitor or special master in expectation of similar even-handeness.

She also was appointed to oversee Charter Communications' compliance with Federal Communications Commission requirements when the company acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks in 2016.

Federal judges presiding over investigations of former Trump attorneys Michael Cohen and Rudolph Giuliani selected Jones to oversee the handling of electronic devices seized from the attorneys by the FBI. Jones' job was to ensure that material covered by attorney-client privilege or other legal exceptions would not be used by prosecutors.

Jones was also tapped by U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres who is overseeing Dec. 2021 FBI seizures from members of Project Veritas a conservative political organization known for undercover videos.

The investigation is examining whether group members and James O'Keefe the organization's founder were involved in obtaining and disclosing parts of a diary that belonged to President Joe Biden's daughter Ashley.

Attorneys from the group have said their clients did nothing improper or illegal.

Citing the First Amendment issues at stake in the seizures Torres wrote that the appointment of an independent special master would signal that the investigation ""would not only be fair but also appear to be fair"" to all.

""There's a reason why she keeps getting picked for these high-profile monitor and special master assignments"" Jeffrey Lichtman a prominent New York City defense lawyer who is representing O'Keefe said of Jones. ""She's right down the middle and comes across as no-nonsense and apolitical."""

Air travel with kids or grandkids is challenging enough without also needing to worry about an airline’s boarding process.

Southwest Airlines has a boarding process with open seating that can be problematic for families. However while there are no plans to change its overall boarding process the airline is experimenting with a new boarding process for families traveling with children 6 years old or younger. The new process will allow families to board — and also sit — together.

“Our Innovation Team is reviewing various passenger movement concepts at select gates at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport including family boarding which is one of many processes being assessed as we look to efficiently and quickly get passengers to their final destinations” a Southwest spokesperson said in a statement according to USA Today.

It does bear mentioning that the trial is “not an indication of a forthcoming policy change” said the spokesperson.

A Need For Change

If you aren’t familiar with Southwest’s boarding practice and open seating it can be confusing.

The airline of course offers pre-boarding for people who need extra time to get on the plane.

All other passengers are assigned a boarding group (A B or C) and a numbered position within that group. Passengers then line up to board the plane and due to open seating they may choose any available seat once they board.

Southwest does offer what it calls “Family Boarding” which takes place after group A has boarded but before the group B begins boarding. In Family Boarding up to two adults traveling with a child 6 years old or younger may board together but the practice doesn’t necessarily ensure all members of a family will be seated together.

That said Southwest does offer passengers a chance to purchase what it calls “EarlyBird Check-In.”

“While EarlyBird Check-In doesn’t guarantee an ‘A’ boarding position you’ll have the benefit of an earlier boarding position a better opportunity to select your preferred available seat and earlier access to overhead bins” Southwest explains.

How Southwest’s Boarding Trial Works

Southwest’s experimental family boarding process is only offered at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta.

Families with children 6 and younger will be able to board Southwest aircraft after pre-boarding but before the general group-lettered boarding process begins the Southwest spokesperson said according to USA Today. Importantly families using the experimental family boarding option will be asked to choose seats behind the exit row.

The trial will take place in phases throughout February.

A Sign Of Things To Come?

Southwest won’t be the only airline experimenting with how it addresses family boarding practices.

That’s because last summer the Department of Transportation issued a notice that “encouraged airlines to do everything in their power to seat families together free of charge.”

Those families include children 13 years old or younger.

“Although the department receives a low number of complaints from consumers about family seating there continue to be complaints of instances where young children including a child as young as 11 months are not seated next to an accompanying adult” explained the notice. “In 4 months from the date of this notice OACP [Office of Aviation Consumer Protection] plans to initiate a review of airline policies and consumer complaints filed with the department.”

The notice then goes on to add that “If airlines’ seating policies and practices are barriers to a child sitting next to an adult family member or other accompanying adult family member the department will consider additional action consistent with its authorities.”

United Airlines  for example has committed to net zero carbon by 2050 without any contribution from traditional carbon offsets. Among its current focuses is corporate partnerships to de-carbonize aviation and venture capital investments.

Globally the aviation industry is estimated to be responsible for about 2.1% of CO2 emissions. In the transportation sector aviation creates about 12% of CO2 emissions while road transport is attributed to 74%. Those numbers are expected to increase on a relative basis in the decades ahead as air travel increases and as auto companies make faster progress on transition to electric vehicles.

That is true but it is also a reason why many climate experts say the airlines should be more focused on bigger goals related to sustainable aviation fuels and their own net-zero goals ex-passenger contributions.

""At the moment there is no alternative to aviation when it comes to long distance and low carbon travel. Carbon offsetting is an immediate direct and pragmatic means to encourage action to limit climate change impacts at least in the short-term"" said Mariam Alqubaisi head of sustainability at Etihad Airways.

In general the way such programs work is that the carbon impact of a flight is calculated and a fee is then determined that can ""offset"" this impact minimizing or zeroing out the carbon imprint of a passenger's flight. Calculating the CO2-equivalent emissions from the flight divided by the number of miles flown and the number of passengers is the basic idea. CO2-equivalent emissions are the emissions of carbon dioxide plus those of other global warming chemicals (e.g black carbon and methane) each multiplied by their global warming potential (ratio of warming over 20 or 100 years of the chemical per unit mass to that of CO2) explained Mark Jacobson professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.

Southwest Airlines ' ""Wanna offset carbon?"" program provides a match from the company for every dollar a customer pays to offset carbon and rapid rewards bonus points – 10 points for every dollar spent.

Etihad Airways recently rolled out a program with partner CarbonClick to allow travelers to offset their flight emissions from a basket of Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) eligible projects that are geographically diverse and offer ways to support communities climate action and biodiversity. This program also gives passengers the ability to earn rewards through participation in what the airline calls Etihad Guest Conscious Choices .

Numerous airlines now offer such programs. American Airlines has a carbon offset plan in partnership with nonprofit Cool Effect  through which customers are provided options for offsetting the carbon emissions associated with their flights. Delta Air Lines has a similar program as part of its net zero initiative .

If you are upset that legroom on airplanes is shrinking you may be relieved to hear that your footprint may be next. Your carbon footprint. Airplane passengers are now given the option to offset the environmental impact of their own flight by paying an extra airfare fee for carbon offsets. Given the rising cost of air travel adding more to the price of a plane ticket may not be especially appealing but recent polling data from Morning Consult has shown that more Americans are willing to consider this a price worth paying.

Within the aviation industry a few airlines have dropped passenger carbon offset programs including JetBlue and EasyJet which ditched the concept to focus more on sustainable airline fuels and more efficient aircrafts. JetBlue achieved carbon neutrality on domestic flights in 2020 and just this month the airline said in its latest net zero carbon policy statement that lowering carbon emissions from operations will take primacy over any contribution from offsets and the goal is to ""drive down the need for carbon credits as much as possible.""

Aviation 'greenwashing'

There also remains skepticism about how well the carbon accounting works in practice and ""greenwashing"" claims have made carbon offset program including those for passengers a potential liability for the airlines. A recent Washington Post article on aviation carbon claims dinged Delta for its use of carbon offsets and that led Delta to speak in a different way about the future of offsets. New Delta chief sustainability officer Pam Fletcher told the Post she opposes buying such credits. ""It was the best tool at the time"" she said. ""So kudos to getting some momentum on climate change. Now we are laser-focused on decarbonization in our company and industry working on the issues within our own four walls.""

""Calculating an individual's carbon footprint can be as much art as science"" Environmental and Energy Study Institute executive director Daniel Bresette explained in an email.

It might be tempting to buy an offset to ease one's conscience Bressette said but the simplest offset schemes merely calculate an estimate based on how many miles the trip will cover. While that that sounds straightforward it fails to account for how fuel-efficient the aircraft is how full it will be or what the weather conditions will be.

""There are a lot of variables to consider when making an accurate calculation"" Bressette wrote.

Bresette said one factor that goes into the calculation is a mix of science and economics that airlines are expert at: estimating and reducing fuel consumption. Fuel is expensive after all making up about a quarter of operating expenses in 2022. ""That's a big share so airlines are incentivized to know precisely how much fuel a flight will need. That helps them calculate the flight's carbon footprint and an individual's share of it"" he said.

Questions to ask about carbon offsets

The harder part is figuring out how to calculate its offset. If the offset is funding tree plantings what kind of tree will be planted and where? If the offset funds renewable energy what type of energy generation will those projects be replacing? If the offset funds go to energy efficiency how carbon intensive is the energy otherwise being consumed? These questions can be answered but only after significant analysis and a lot of information-gathering. That means a lot of fine print from passengers to read.

""Until carbon offsets are better regulated and more transparent travelers need to exercise due diligence to determine whether they're worthwhile in terms of costs and benefits. Offsets should be transparent about what climate benefits a traveler is making possible"" Bresette said.

As part of consciousness-raising it is helpful for people to think in terms of their own carbon footprints and how they can reduce them. But stated preferences can be quite different from actual consumer behavior which is much harder to change.

""The bright shine on carbon offsets has dimmed"" said Scott Keyes founder of Scott's Cheap Flights.

No matter what people say in polls a vast majority of customers skip past paying an extra fee for carbon offsets when booking their flights Keyes said. ""Maybe they don't believe the extra dollars will be an effective way to create an impact or maybe they don't want to pay an extra fee for an already expensive flight.""

The price point depending on the length of flight is not high compared to the overall cost of a plane ticket. American Airlines' calculator shows a range from under $10 for shorter flights to as high as $25 for flights 13-plus hours. That price is set by the average price per tonne for the American Airlines portfolio of carbon offset projects which include forest regeneration in Mexico restoration of peat swamp in Indonesia and construction of improved cookstoves for families in Honduras. Southwest Airlines shows offsets for a New York to Los Angeles flight at $3.59 and says its pricing is based off of ""aircraft type conventional jet fuel consumption flight distance and assumed load factor.""

Consumer psychology and the environment

It's not just about the dollar amount of the carbon offset purchase in the consumer psychology.

""It's something that people are very price sensitive to"" Keyes said. ""I think that everybody wants a better environment everyone would love for flights and planes to emit less carbon but I think people have shown that they're not willing to pay extra in order to achieve that.""

He gave the example of grocery stores asking customers if they'd like to round up their total for charity – though a small number of individuals may say yes a majority will say no for similar reasons Keyes said referring to the fact that they are paying a big bill already or don't understand where the money will really be going.

Keyes cited Lufthansa Group CEO Carsten Spohr who said in 2020 the airline only saw 1-2% of passengers choose to purchase the cheapest option of carbon offsets while the more expensive alternative was ""used by so few customers that I could greet them all individually with a handshake.""

If airline travelers want to stay environmentally conscious without paying carbon offset fees Keyes recommends choosing cheaper airlines when traveling. The more expensive an airline the more culpable for airline emissions as the aircrafts usually have less seats increasing the amount of carbon emissions per individual. Consistently overpaying for flights also gives airlines more incentive to add additional flights for that route and that may also increase carbon emissions.

In other words if you want to reduce your carbon footprint on a flight the best option might be to reduce your comfort. A tradeoff many fliers are already making when they take to the skies.

""It's true that we all have a part to play in reducing carbon emissions. But it is unfair to place the burden squarely on individuals"" Bressette said. ""When I board a plane I don't have a lot of say in how the flight is going to go. Airlines though do have a lot of say which means they have a major responsibility to do right by the climate including by using sustainable aviation fuels and improving the energy efficiency of their operations.""

On Monday the Greater Taylor Chamber of Commerce is hosting an invitation-only ribbon cutting for the grand opening of the coffee retailer Starbucks which will soon open across the street from the Taylor Independent School District Administrative offices and Main Street Intermediate School.

“We are happy to confirm that we are opening a new location at 3116 N. Main Street which will be the first Starbucks location in Taylor TX” said a spokesperson for Starbucks. “We are proud to join Taylor community and look forward to acting as a gathering place for citizens and visitors of the community for years to come.”

Though as of press time the company was unable to confirm the exact date Chamber President Tia Rae Stone said she thinks it will likely be sometime this week.

“We have a ribboncutting set up” Stone said. “It’s an invitationonly kind of thing. It’s their friends and family kind of day … My guess is it will open on the 19th or 20th (of December).”

Though Stone said she thinks the retailer will be welcome by locals she thinks the arrival of Starbucks is going to be especially helpful for people visiting Taylor for various events.

“I know a lot of locals are excited but downtown patrons tend to be downtown patrons” Stone said. “And this is going to really appeal to our people who are coming in for baseball games. We have a lot of people who come in for baseball games and softball games out at the sports complex and out to the Williamson County Expo Center for special events. I think this will be great for those guests in our community.”

In addition Stone said she hopes Starbucks will be a boon to the local area.

“I also hope it’s going to be good for that shopping center right there” Stone said. “I hope that it will get more people over there and stimulate that a little bit. I think it certainly has the potential to do that.”

Mark Thomas the president and CEO of the Taylor Economic Development Corporation said Starbucks’ arrival is related to that of Samsung Austin Semiconductor which his office helped bring to Taylor late last year.

“It’s kind of like somebody said ‘What does Taylor need?’ and it was kind of like everything when I first got here but now we have addressed the industrial side with such a mega announcement and that’s really kind of changed the world on that side it’s the other sectors now and they will all be brought along” Thomas said. “Having Starbucks is an indication of what is getting ready to happen in the future because they are very savvy site selectors and they don’t make mistakes so if they have decided that we are a good place for one of those locations that’s a really big deal.”

With regards to Samsung Stone said she was sure the global semiconductor manufacturer would make good use of the coffee purveyor’s new location.

“It’s going to be a long trip for coffee for Samsung folks well long trip in Taylor terms for coffee but they were really happy to see it coming” Stone said. “That’s going to make it easier for them to do big groups.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vMTEzNjgwMC93aGVuLWRpZC1zdGFyYnVja3MtYmVnaW4tc2VsbGluZy1mb29kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When Did Starbucks Begin Selling Food?,"When Did Starbucks Begin Selling Food?

Starbucks is undoubtedly the most successful coffee chain in the world. Its 2021 gross annual sales amounted to a whopping $29 billion and according to Zippia it takes up 33% of the American market share. But while it's most well-known for its decadent coffee beverages — including a wide range of beloved festive drinks – its products go far beyond java.

Starbucks now sells a full menu of food options to accompany your beverage of choice including hot breakfasts an array of pastries lunch boxes cake pops and more. The Starbucks 2022 holiday menu alone features a chocolate pistachio swirl pastry an adorable reindeer cake pop and a jolly snowman cookie.

Although drinks are the chain's primary source of revenue it's not doing too shabby with food sales either. According to Business Quaint food products accounted for nearly 18% of Starbucks' revenue in the first quarter of 2022 with a number of individual items garnering their own fan bases. While expanding the menu was a smart move for the company there was a time when it was unclear how well these food items would do. So exactly when and how did Starbucks decide to take the leap into food.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbW9udGNsYWlybG9jYWwubmV3cy8yMDIyLzEyL21vbnRjbGFpci1zdGFyYnVja3MtZW1wbG95ZWVzLXRha2UtcGFydC1pbi0zLWRheS13YWxrb3V0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Montclair Starbucks employees take part in 3-day walkout,"Employees of a local Montclair Starbucks have joined more than 1000 baristas across the country in a three-day strike and walkout. This is the second strike in a month for the franchise.

The Church Street Starbucks located at 40 South Park St. is the fourth Starbucks franchise in the state to unionize having joined Starbucks Workers United in early August 2022. Since then employees have said the store has been plagued by poor management discrimination understaffing and a lack of general respect.

Initially the Church Street Starbucks planned only a one-day strike for Sunday. However after what an employee described as a high-anxiety situation played out on Friday fed-up workers decided to begin the walkout on the spot.

An espresso machine broke down during Friday’s morning shift the employee said. The manager controlling the store that day who was filling in for the store’s usual manager refused to shut down the mobile ordering option for customers. This led to an influx of orders with only one machine available to brew espresso shots.

“It was a very large backup” said James Cruz a 24-year-old barista. “Customers were very stressed out and the employees were stressed out. And at some point they asked if they could just go on strike right then and there.”

So around 8 a.m. on Friday baristas of the Church Street Starbucks packed up and left their shifts leaving the store to be run by managers. For the rest of that day baristas stood outside in the rain with a couple of signs marching around the store expressing their frustration with the company.

For months the Church Street Starbucks has been fighting to meet with the company to negotiate legally enforceable policies including ones related to customer and employee safety and sanitation. Without these official legally binding rules Cruz said they are viewed as only suggestions.

“They’re just policies the store has made and there’s no legal protections on those” Cruz said. “So they can be chosen to not be enforced But what we’re trying to do is we’re trying to get those basic safeties available for us available for our customers and everyone.”

Union members at the Church Street store say they have been victims of a union-busting effort with the company refusing to offer better working conditions and purposely harassing employees for being a unionized group.

“There has been no movement” Cruz said. “In fact it’s starting to seem like it’s more like regression. New rules are popping up that were either never enforced or never existed until recently and there is a constant boundary pushing from Starbucks against our union.”

In a previous interview Cruz said employees of the Church Street Starbucks were being denied schedule changes typically allowed as the school season approached. Now Cruz said baristas are being picked on by management for wearing certain buttons on their aprons or wearing college sweatshirts.

Starbucks has also been threatening other local Starbucks franchises interested in joining the union Cruz said. In some ways Cruz said Starbucks tries to lure potential union joiners away from Starbucks Workers United by claiming that by doing so employees will lose all of their benefits.

“These are the common things that we hear from other baristas from non-unionized stores when they’re talking to us about their concerns” Cruz said. “This is completely false information. Starbucks has shown in the past that they’re willing to go as far as making complete boldface lies that are even sometimes illegal in order to try to keep stores from unionizing.”

Starbucks reached out to comment on the ongoing strike and the Church Street employees’ claims of mistreatment.

“It is unfortunate that Workers United continues to spread misleading claims while disrupting the Starbucks Experience that our partners and customers have come to love and expect” a Starbucks spokesperson said via email. “Despite these delay tactics we remain focused on working together and engaging meaningfully and directly with the union to make Starbucks a company that works for everyone and we urge Workers United to uphold their promises to partners by moving the bargaining process forward.”

On Nov. 17 the Church Street Starbucks took part in another strike on one of the company’s biggest days – Red Cup Day. Since the “Red Cup Rebellion” Cruz said the Montclair store has yet to see a request for negotiation by Starbucks. However the location has bonded with the three other unionized locations – Hamilton Howell and Summit – and has assisted with their negotiations as well as supporting the non-unionized local branches.

“We do understand that it’s a scary thing and we do understand that you know the company is going extremely rough but we want them to know that they are cared about” Cruz said. “They are supported by us no matter what.”

(AP) — Jordan Mims and Jake Haener helped complete the biggest in-season turnaround in Football Bowl Subdivision history in their final game for Fresno State

Mims rushed for a career-high 205 yards and two scores Haener threw two TD passes and the Bulldogs rolled to a 29-6 victory over Washington State in the LA Bowl on Saturday.

Fresno State — which won the Mountain West Conference title — is the first team to get to 10 wins after dropping four of the first five. The Bulldogs (10-4) were 1-4 in early October before winning their final nine games.

“We set history today. Every guy in that locker room day in and day out has been resilient and positive” said Haener who completed 24 of 36 passes for 284 yards.

Mims — who was selected as game’s offensive MVP — accounted for 232 all-purpose yards and outgained Washington State which had 182 offensive yards. Both of Mims’ touchdowns were on direct snaps out of the Wildcat formation.

Early in the second quarter the senior went 4 yards around left end to give the Bulldogs a 14-0 advantage. In the fourth quarter he carried it 2 yards up the middle to make it 29-6.

“It felt surreal. I knew I had a pretty solid game. Our line did their thing and I followed them” Mims said. “We always want to stick with the run game and pound the ball first. It was good for us to make plays on the ground and we can dish out here and there and throw shots.”

Haener connected with Zane Pope on a 22-yard touchdown to complete the Bulldogs’ opening possession. He added an 11-yard score to Nikko Remigio late in the third quarter to extend the lead to 22-6.

Cameron Ward was 22 of 32 for 137 yards for Washington State (7-6).

Nakia Watson rushed for 33 yards and had the Cougars only touchdown in the third quarter when he scored from 1 yard to bring Washington State within 16-6.

“I don’t think we ever got in a rhythm. We never established running the football which is a key piece to what we always want to do” coach Jake Dickert said. “Those are some things as we watch the tape that we’ll kind of hopefully lean into and learn.”

GETTING DEFENSIVE

Fresno State made it 16-0 with a safety in the second quarter. On third-and-14 from the Cougars’ 3-yard line Ward was pressured by Bulldogs’ defensive lineman Leonard Payne Jr. and stepped on the end line in the back of the end zone.

It was the second time in the last three games the Bulldogs have scored on a safety.

HOW ‘BOUT THEM APPLES?

Haener began his career at the University of Washington. He spent two seasons there but transferred in 2019 after losing the QB competition in fall camp.

Haener never played in the Apple Cup rivalry game against Washington State but had his own personal victory on Saturday.

In a post on social media Haener looked into the camera with an apple and said “this is my Apple Cup.” He took a bite of the apple and tossed into the air before saying “I love it.”

THE TAKEAWAY

Fresno State: The Bulldogs have won four straight bowl games and have their second consecutive season with double-digit victories. It also completes a great first year for Jeff Tedford who is in his second stint at Fresno State after Kalen DeBoer left for Washington.

“There’s a lot of teams where people opt out of games. I didn’t hear any talk about that because our players have commitment to each other and want to do something special” Tedford said. “I think that’s a real tribute to the guys on our team.”

Washington State: The Cougars have dropped their last three bowl games but were short-handed after both coordinators left for other positions. Washington State also was impacted at wide receiver and linebacker with players opting out of the game or putting their name in the transfer portal.

“I thought operationally we were pretty good. We just needed to get in a little bit more rhythm and establish some toughness which we just weren’t able to do” Dickert said.

Last year it brought in more than $130 million in revenue the bulk of which came from its federal contract to service student loans.

MOHELA like the Education Department’s other loan servicers had been moving ahead with implementing the Biden administration’s debt relief until it was halted by the courts in November. The company had gone so far as to finalize a letter — co-branded with both MOHELA and federal logos — notifying borrowers that their debt relief request had been completed according to documents obtained by POLITICO under a public records request.

But at the same time MOHELA has been drawn into the fight against student debt relief by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt one of the lead plaintiffs in the multi-state lawsuit even though the company is not a party to the case.

The other states pursuing the legal challenge include Nebraska Iowa South Carolina Kansas and Arkansas. They claim Biden’s debt relief plan will harm them in a range of ways such as lowering tax revenue or diminishing the value of investments tied to student loans.

But it’s Missouri’s portion of the case asserting financial harm to MOHELA that has occupied much of the attention from legal observers and lower courts.

Missouri argues that MOHELA will lose money under Biden’s relief plan because it’ll have fewer accounts to manage. Less revenue for the company Missouri says will make it more difficult for MOHELA to make required payments to a state fund that helps its public colleges and universities.

Seizing on the harm to loan servicers that work for the Education Department like MOHELA was “the best opportunity to bring a successful lawsuit” said Phil Kerpen a conservative political organizer who leads American Commitment and was an early proponent of the strategy and circulated the idea in conservative circles.

All of the loan servicers hired by the Education Department decided against suing over the debt relief plan. MOHELA presented a different situation Kerpen noted because of the company’s relationship to a state with a Republican attorney general who could take action on its behalf.

When Biden first announced his plan to forgive student debt in August Republicans and conservative groups vowed to bring legal challenges to the policy. But finding a plaintiff who would have a concrete injury that allows them to bring a lawsuit was a major challenge.

MOHELA’s role in the case has brought fresh criticism from some Democrats and consumer advocacy groups.

Rep. Cori Bush the progressive Democrat whose district neighbors the company’s Chesterfield Mo. headquarters for instance blasted MOHELA for what she called an “unconscionable” effort to stop debt relief. MOHELA she added in a statement to POLITICO is “a proxy for the six conservative attorneys general” to challenge the administration’s debt relief program and “would profit off this challenge’s success.”

MOHELA responded to Bush’s criticism last month by appearing to distance itself from the lawsuit. The company explained in a letter to Bush that its “executives were not involved” with the Missouri attorney general’s decision to file a lawsuit.

With much at stake for the company’s federal loan servicing business MOHELA officials from the company have also sought to reassure Democratic congressional aides and Biden administration officials that they were not involved in the Missouri attorney general’s lawsuit seeking to block debt relief according to people familiar with the conversations.

MOHELA did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Company executives haven’t detailed publicly — in court or otherwise — how they expect Biden’s debt relief would affect the company. Some of their competitors in the industry have forecast some type of financial hit if the plan moves ahead.

Progressives object to the idea that the interests of any Education Department contractor would be used to overturn an administration’s student loan policy.

“It’s not just that this could derail debt cancellation but it sets up a dynamic where the legal status of these contractors creates veto points in the student loan system that allows it to become even more partisan and more dysfunctional” said Mike Pierce the executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center. “Ultimately borrowers are going to pay the price for that.”

For decades after it was created by Missouri lawmakers in 1981 MOHELA made student loans that were guaranteed by the federal government. That changed when President Barack Obama in 2010 signed legislation to scrap the program which Democrats viewed as a wasteful giveaway to lenders. In response to concerns state entities like MOHELA would go out of business Congress required the Education Department to set aside new loan servicing contracts for those companies.

“I think no one thought through the politics of that and here we are 12 years later and the cost of that patronage may kill debt cancellation for tens of millions of people” Pierce said.

MOHELA has drastically expanded its loan-servicing business since it received an initial Education Department contract in 2011 to service about 100000 federal student loans winning additional contracts and new business from the agency. As of August MOHELA managed the accounts of 6.7 million borrowers on behalf of the Education Department. It also services the accounts of an additional 330000 borrowers of private loans.

The large expansion followed the company’s effort to beef up its Washington presence. Over the past decade or so the company began hiring an outside firm to lobby Congress and the Education Department. And it established a D.C. office in the same building complex that houses the Education Department’s Office of Federal Student Aid.

On Capitol Hill MOHELA has benefited from having Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt as the top GOP appropriator overseeing education funding. Senate appropriators have repeatedly added language to government funding bills that effectively require the Education Department to keep companies like MOHELA in the mix as the agency has tried to overhaul its student loan servicing contracts over the past several years.

MOHELA has also managed to stay relatively clear of controversy as Democrats and progressives sharply criticized the student loan servicing industry in recent years. It avoided the fate of some larger companies like Navient and FedLoan Servicing which were dogged by federal and state lawsuits and investigations into their loan servicing practices.

The Biden administration last year renewed MOHELA’s loan servicing contract through 2023. It also awarded the company millions of new accounts by designating it the new exclusive contractor to manage the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program which cancels the debt of public service employees after 10 years. Fixing the long-troubled program which had previously been operated by FedLoan Servicing has been a major priority of Democrats.

MOHELA’s role in the debt relief lawsuit so far has been mixed for the GOP states pursuing the case. In October a federal judge in St. Louis tossed out the GOP states’ lawsuit finding that MOHELA was too far removed from the state of Missouri for the attorney general to sue on its behalf. The judge ruled that the other states also lacked standing.

But a federal appeals court in November took a different approach. “Due to MOHELA’s financial obligations to the State treasury the challenged student loan debt cancellation presents a threatened financial harm to the State of Missouri” a three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded.

The Supreme Court will now consider whether the states have standing to bring their lawsuit when it hears the case in February or March. That will determine whether the justices end up reaching a decision on the legality of the administration’s plan under the emergency authority the Education Department claims it has to cancel debt for millions as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The justices have also agreed to hear a second case that’s based on whether two borrowers are able to sue because they were deprived of the opportunity to submit public comments on the policy.

Advocates for debt relief though acknowledge that the battles to defend the administration’s program extend beyond MOHELA. A loss at the Supreme Court is also likely to spur new calls for Biden to try another legal authority to cancel student debt.

“Ultimately MOHELA is not a plaintiff in this case” Bush said. “The pressure should be applied on the attorneys general to drop the case the Supreme Court to rule in favor of the people who stand to benefit from this relief and the Biden Administration to continue using its legal authority to ensure student debt relief is swiftly delivered to borrowers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVycG9zdG9ubGluZS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sL3dyZXN0bGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzE3L2Nvbmxpbi1yZXR1cm5zLXRvLXNvdXRoLWplcnNleS13aWxsLXdyZXN0bGUtYXQtc3QtYXVndXN0aW5lLzY5NzI4Nzk3MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Conlin returns to South Jersey will wrestle at St. Augustine,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVycG9zdG9ubGluZS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sL3dyZXN0bGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzE3L2Nvbmxpbi1yZXR1cm5zLXRvLXNvdXRoLWplcnNleS13aWxsLXdyZXN0bGUtYXQtc3QtYXVndXN0aW5lLzY5NzI4Nzk3MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D80814910>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Dubbed the Meta “Grand Teton” the new platform is designed to house 8x NVIDIA H100 GPUs while greatly increasing interconnect bandwidth.

This is the Meta Grand Teton 8x NVIDIA H100 Machine

This is the side view of the massive Meta Grand Teton system with 8x NVIDIA H100 GPUs in a pull-out tray:

One can see a few common features. For example Meta is using many OCP NIC 3.0 form factor network cards. There are at least ten that we could on the front of the chassis. In this generation with PCIe Gen5 they can be 200GbE or 400GbE/ 400Gbps IB ports. The company also has an EDSFF (E1) storage array on the front of the chassis and another section for E1.S boot drives. If you want to learn more about EDSFF you can see E1 and E3 EDSFF to Take Over from M.2 and 2.5 in SSDs. This is a great example of the M.2 boot devices being phased out in favor of E1.S.

Meta says that the new system offers significantly more bandwidth and also simplifies deployment with a single box versus having a CPU head node a switching box and then the accelerators.

At the same time power is up 2x over the previous generation which is quite impressive. That is a bigger jump than the NVIDIA A100 to NVIDIA H100 jump with the H100’s public specs at 700W. CPU TDP is going up in this generation as is NIC TDP.

Final Words

Meta uses AI all over and is a leader in the space so seeking more performance makes a lot of sense here. This is an especially interesting announcement since Meta RSC Selected NVIDIA and Pure Storage for its AI Research Cluster in the NVIDIA A100 generation. Now Meta has its own training platform. This does not seem like the company’s craziest platform but it is nice to see some innovation happening in the space. For companies that are not Meta this platform looks very similar to many of the Supermicro QCT and other platforms that we have seen for 8x NVIDIA H100 configurations.",,,,,,,,,,,,

PepsiCo Inc which ordered the big trucks in 2017 is purchasing them ""outright"" and is also upgrading its plants including installing four 750-kilowatt Tesla Inc charging stalls at both its Modesto and Sacramento locations in California PepsiCo Vice President Mike O'Connell said in an interview. A $15.4 million state grant and $40000 federal subsidy per vehicle helps offset part of the costs.

""It's a great starting point to electrify"" said O'Connell who oversees the company's fleet of vehicles.

""Like any early technology the incentives help us build out the program"" he said adding that there were ""lots"" of development and infrastructure costs.

PepsiCo is the first company to experiment with the battery-powered Tesla Semis as a way of cutting its environmental impact.

United Parcel Service Inc and food delivery company Sysco Corp have also reserved the trucks while retailer Walmart Inc is testing alternatives.

PepsiCo's plans to use the Semis have been reported but O'Connell provided new details on how the company is using them and its timeline for deploying them. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk initially said the trucks would be in production by 2019 but that was delayed due to battery constraints.

PepsiCo said it plans to deploy 15 trucks from Modesto and 21 from Sacramento. It is unclear where the others will be based but O'Connell said the firm is targeting rolling out the Semis in the central United States next and then the East Coast.

The company's Frito-Lay division sells lightweight food products making it a good candidate for electric trucks which have heavy batteries that could limit cargo capacity.

The Semis will haul Frito-Lay food products for around 425 miles (684 km) but for heavier loads of sodas the trucks will initially do shorter trips of around 100 miles (160 km) O'Connell said. PepsiCo then will also use the Semis to haul beverages in the ""400 to 500 mile range as well"" O'Connell said.

""Dragging a trailer full of chips around is not the most intense tough ask"" said Oliver Dixon senior analyst at consultancy Guidehouse.

""I still believe that Tesla has an awful lot to prove to the broader commercial vehicle marketplace"" Dixon said citing Tesla's unwillingness to offer information on payload and pricing.

PepsiCo has earmarked some of the trucks planned for the Sacramento location to make deliveries to Walmart and grocers such as Kroger Co and Albertsons Cos Inc. The trucks at the Modesto Frito-Lay plant have just gone to PepsiCo distribution centers O'Connell said.

All of the Semis going to PepsiCo will have a 500-mile (805-km) range. O'Connell added that he is not aware of when Tesla will start deploying 300-mile (480-km) trucks. When Tesla starts building them PepsiCo ""will rotate those up"" into its fleet he said.

PepsiCo declined to share details on the price of the trucks a figure that Tesla has kept quiet. Competing vehicles sell for $230000 to $240000 said Mark Barrott of consulting firm Plante Moran. He added that the 500-mile range Tesla Semi could be priced higher because its 1000-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery pack is about twice the size of many of its rivals.

""We keep the trucks for a million miles seven years"" O'Connell said. ""The operating costs over time will pay back.""

The Gatorade maker declined to share specifics on the weight of the trucks another closely guarded secret by Tesla.

He said Tesla did not help pay for the trucks' megachargers but provided design and engineering services for the facilities which come with solar and battery storage systems.

O'Connell said that a 425-mile (684-km) trip carrying Frito-Lay products brings the Semi's battery down to roughly 20% and recharging it takes around 35 to 45 minutes.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If anything at least we see 5G icons in our status bars on most days although that connection ranges from slower than LTE to faster than our home internet at any given moment. It’s not the 5G we were promised but it is technically here.

I bring up 5G because the entire US carrier ecosystem is now built around who has the best 5G thanks to a combination of who can claim to cover the most people on 5G and how fast that 5G is. 5G is basically the only thing carriers want to talk about because they reintroduced unlimited plans a few years back and have adjusted those in all the ways possible in order to capture your attention and get you to stick around or switch over. They are out of ideas there. 5G is how they believe they can standout from competitors.

And in that 5G race I think it’s obvious that T-Mobile took the lead some time ago and likely won’t give it up any time soon. They are standing out from AT&T and Verizon in 5G. Stories like this one from Bloomberg capture this as T-Mobile’s 5G lead has led to a handful of rocky years for Verizon where heads of their consumer unit have departed because of slow growth. There are quotes in that story from analysts who also believe that Verizon screwed up its early 5G bet and may have lost its network leadership position an idea that was unthinkable at one time for the US’ biggest carrier.

The readers of this site were at one point almost all Verizon customers. We started by covering a single device the original Motorola Droid which was exclusive to Verizon so it made sense. But as the years have passed (13 years of DL!) there has no doubt been a switch from many to T-Mobile – AT&T not as much. The polls tell the story. There are also those who continue on with Verizon and may never switch away and they almost always tell us it’s because of the network where they live.

As interesting as the story is that Verizon has lost some of its network reputation and that T-Mobile continues to shine I can’t help but wonder if there’s something else driving the slow growth from Verizon beyond choosing the wrong 5G network out of the gate. Are customers simply unhappy with everything from Verizon not just 5G? Or is the network in a bad enough spot overall that finding another carrier is a thing that’s happening? Maybe you finally feel comfortable with another carrier for the first time?

Let’s talk about it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvdC1tb2JpbGUtaGFja2VyLWdldHMtMTAteWVhcnMtZm9yLTI1LW1pbGxpb24tcGhvbmUtdW5sb2NrLXNjaGVtZS_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibGVlcGluZ2NvbXB1dGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NlY3VyaXR5L3QtbW9iaWxlLWhhY2tlci1nZXRzLTEwLXllYXJzLWZvci0yNS1taWxsaW9uLXBob25lLXVubG9jay1zY2hlbWUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile hacker gets 10 years for $25 million phone unlock scheme,"Argishti Khudaverdyan the former owner of a T-Mobile retail store was sentenced to 10 years in prison for a $25 million scheme where he unlocked and unblocked cellphones by hacking into T-Mobile's internal systems.

Between August 2014 and June 2019 the 44-year-old man behind the scheme who was also ordered to pay $28473535 in restitution ""cleaned"" hundreds of thousands of cellphones for his ""customers.""

Khudaverdyan's contract as the owner of the Top Tier Solutions T-Mobile retail store in California was terminated by the wireless carrier in June 2017 due to his suspicious computer behavior and association with unauthorized unlocking of cellphones.

""From August 2014 to June 2019 Khudaverdyan fraudulently unlocked and unblocked cellphones on T-Mobile's network as well as the networks of Sprint AT&T and other carriers"" the Department of Justice said in a press release.

""Removing the unlock allowed the phones to be sold on the black market and enabled T-Mobile customers to stop using T-Mobile's services and thereby deprive T-Mobile of revenue generated from customers' service contracts and equipment installment plans.""

With co-defendant Alen Gharehbagloo his former business partner and the co-owner of the mobile store Khudaverdyan gained access to T-Mobile's internal computer systems using credentials stolen in phishing attacks from more than 50 different T-Mobile employees.

The stolen credentials were used to access T-Mobile's internal computer systems and in many cases for password resets which locked the account owners out of the system.

""Working with others in overseas call centers Khudaverdyan also received T-Mobile employee credentials which he then used to access T-Mobile systems to target higher-level employees by harvesting those employees’ personal identifying information and calling the T-Mobile IT Help Desk to reset the employees’ company passwords giving him unauthorized access to the T-Mobile systems which allowed him to unlock and unblock cellphones"" US DOJ said in an August press release when Khudaverdyan was found guilty.

Throughout the scheme they advertised ""direct premium unlocking services for all phone carriers"" to potential customers through various means including emails and dedicated websites like unlocks247.com swiftunlocked.com unlockitall.com tryunlock.com and unlockedlocked.com.

​Using the stolen credentials and the IMEI numbers sent by customers through the websites they controlled the two men unlocked hundreds of thousands of Android and iOS devices using T-Mobile's dedicated Mobile Device Unlock (MDU) and MCare Unlock (MCare) tools.

While the MDU tool could only be used by authorized T-Mobile employees MCare didn't require authentication as it was based on IP address blocks assigned to T-Mobile/Metro locations.

On at least one occasion on March 29 2017 the defendant used his own T-Mobile credential (akhudav1) to log into a T-Mobile Wi-Fi access point from Texas and access the unlockitall.com website directly linking himself to the illegal cellphone unlock scheme.

""Whether the iPhone is clean financed blocked or leased we can perform convenient factory-grade unlocks on all iPhone and iPad devices that have been iCloud locked without voiding your phone's warranty"" Khudaverdyan told one potential customer in an email advertising his services according to the superseding indictment.

""We've been unlocking cell phones for years and our specialty is in providing competitive iCloud unlocking services and Clean/Financed T-Mobile iPhone services.

""Unlike other companies that use' hacking unlock' with the possibility of your iPhone being re-locked in the future our T-mobile unlock is Official and directly through Apple and T-mobile.""

Alen Gharehbagloo his former business partner and the co-owner of the mobile store also pleaded guilty on July 5 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud accessing a protected computer with intent to defraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

Gharehbagloo's sentencing hearing is scheduled to take place in two months on February 23 2023.

Compared against 4G LTE,"David Imel / Android Authority

You may have heard a lot about 5G lately – the next generation of mobile network technology. According to carriers and smartphone makers 5G has the potential to revolutionize the way we stay connected while on the go. But setting aside the hype for a moment just how fast can 5G networks go in the real world and how does it compare to the current 4G networks? Here’s everything you need to know. Related: The best 5G plans in the US

QUICK ANSWER The median 5G speed in the US hovers around 100 Mbps today but that statistic improves with every passing month. T-Mobile is currently the fastest 5G carrier with median speeds approaching 200 Mbps. If you don't see similar speeds it's likely because you're connected to a low-band 5G network. Keep reading to learn more.

How fast is 5G? Before we talk numbers it’s worth understanding how 5G works and where the speed gains come from. In a nutshell 5G uses more wireless spectrum than 4G which allows for faster data transmission and increased capacity. The latter means you won’t find a 5G connection slow down in dense urban areas where 4G LTE would likely struggle. This also makes the former ideal for applications that require a lot of data such as video streaming and cloud gaming.

Having said that a 5G cell signal doesn’t always mean you’re getting the fastest possible connection. You see the 5G wireless spectrum is divided into three distinct frequency bands — low-band mid-band and high-band. The highest frequencies (also referred to as mmWave) offer blazing-fast speeds that far surpass previous cellular generations. If you’ve ever witnessed or heard of 5G speeds in excess of 1Gbps it was likely achieved on a mmWave network.

mmWave 5G doesn't penetrate obstacles like walls very well but mid-Band 5G delivers a good mix of speed and range.

However mmWave suffers from a few problems. Even setting aside the expensive infrastructure costs to deploy cutting-edge towers at scale high frequencies do not penetrate obstacles very well. In the real world your phone will likely struggle to maintain a mmWave connection indoors. And even if it doesn’t lose signal entirely you’ll experience slower data transfers and higher latency.

To counter this problem carriers typically deploy mmWave interspersed with low-band and mid-band networks. Low-band uses similar frequencies as 4G which means you get reliable coverage regardless of whether you’re indoors or outdoors. Mid-band offers a healthy balance of performance and range as we’ll discuss in the next section. Read more: Why sub-6GHz 5G is more important than mmWave

It’s worth noting that not all devices support mmWave 5G. Generally speaking flagship smartphones from Google Apple and Samsung in the US do include the necessary hardware. But if you live outside the US or buy an unlocked device you may not have (or even need) mmWave 5G connectivity. See our list: The best 5G phones you can buy right now

5G speeds vs. 4G LTE speeds in numbers: Is one any faster?

OpenSignal

Now that we know how the 5G spectrum works it shouldn’t come as a surprise that you may experience huge fluctuations in download speeds from one network to another.

5G speeds above 100 Mbps have become increasingly common but performance heavily depends on the frequency band and signal strength.

At the top end for example mmWave networks can deliver speeds above 1Gbps in the real world. While the theoretical limit is much higher at 10Gbps your smartphone’s SoC and modem won’t be able to keep up. Moreover any obstructions like tree cover can deteriorate signal quality and download speeds.

At the other end of the spectrum lies low-band 5G which doesn’t have a lot of bandwidth but can easily cover several miles at once. Unsurprisingly this is the slowest kind so you can’t expect it to perform much faster than 4G — if at all.

Finally we have mid-band 5G which you may also find referred to as C-band in the US. It can offer speeds in the neighborhood of 100 to 900Mbps plenty fast for most use cases. Most carriers around the world consider mid-band 5G as the perfect balance between speed and coverage. You don’t lose as much coverage as with mmWave while still gaining speed over lower frequencies. C-band deployments have started to gain momentum in the US so expect to see meaningful speed improvements in the near future.

According to tests conducted by OpenSignal Verizon’s C-band boosted 5G speeds by around 25%. In the graph above we observe a noticeable increase in Verizon’s average 5G download speeds once the carrier brought its C-band infrastructure online in early 2022. And when you look at mid-band 5G results alone Verizon and T-Mobile consistently deliver download speeds of over 200Mbps.

Does carrier choice matter? Which US carrier has the fastest 5G speeds

Kris Carlon / Android Authority

In the US T-Mobile currently holds a distinct lead over both Verizon and At&t in terms of 5G speeds. In the third quarter of 2022 Ookla found that T-Mobile scored the fastest median download speeds nearly double that of Verizon. These results were also consistent with OpenSignal’s findings which pegged T-Mobile’s median speeds at just over 170Mbps around the same time frame. Verizon and At&t should catch up in the future but currently lag behind T-Mobile by about 100Mbps.

Median 5G speeds hover around 100Mbps in the US but you should expect better results in the near future.

Of course not everyone needs the fastest network. Verizon’s 100Mbps median download speed will likely serve most customers’ needs today. Moreover your location may yield different results than the above reports depending on factors like the number of users and proximity to the nearest cell tower. The best way to find out which carrier offers the best 5G service for your needs is to take a look at their coverage maps like this one from T-Mobile.

Finally keep in mind that carriers sometimes use their own branding to refer to mid-band and mmWave frequencies. In the US for example Verizon uses the 5G Nationwide and 5G Ultra Wideband to differentiate between the two. Similarly T-Mobile customers may notice a 5G UC label on their smartphone when connected to the carrier’s fastest 5G networks. Read more: What does 5G UC mean?

How to measure 5G speeds on your phone

You can find out how well your 5G connection performs with a speed test. Simply open fast.com or speedtest.net in a web browser on your smartphone and run the test. You can also download an app from the Android Play Store or iOS App Store to accomplish the same thing. Make sure that you’re disconnected from Wi-Fi and that your phone is connected via a 5G signal.

As a rule of thumb speeds above 100Mbps represent an upgrade over most 4G LTE networks. And if your phone manages to achieve gigabit speeds you’ve likely connected to a mmWave or C-band network.

FAQs

Does 5G penetrate walls better? 5G networks operate in low mid and high band frequencies. The low band frequencies (below 1 GHz) have longer wavelengths and can penetrate walls and other obstacles more easily than higher frequencies. However don’t expect speeds to be faster than 4G as low frequencies lack bandwidth and capacity.

Is 5G faster than Wi-Fi? It’s unfair to compare 5G and Wi-Fi as the speed will heavily depend on the underlying infrastructure. Typically you can pay more each month for faster broadband (Wi-Fi) speeds but you cannot control 5G network quality as you move from one place to another.

Do 5G towers have better range? Cellular networks use low frequencies to maximize range. Since 5G uses higher frequencies to achieve increased capacity and blazing-fast speeds you may actually notice better signal strength on older networks.

Will 5G replace Wi-Fi for good? The blazing-fast 5G speed claims you’ve probably heard about don’t always hold up in indoor testing because high-band 5G frequencies are easily blocked by obstacles like walls. Even if you were well serviced by 5G towers around your house you’ll still have to deal with monthly data caps which are far higher (if not non-existent) in residential Wi-Fi connections. So can 5G replace Wi-Fi for good? Maybe in the future but not anytime soon.

The Year in Pictures 2022

By Joseph Kahn executive editor

The images from the earliest moments of the Ukraine conflict revealed sheer terror and disbelief. War had reached a major European capital Kyiv and its immediate outskirts. Refugees shoved their way onto a train headed west pushing past a woman who shut her eyes and screamed.

A woman and her two children lay dead on a roadside felled by a blast that narrowly missed our photographer Lynsey Addario. The first photo we published of a dead Russian soldier in Kharkiv a day after the conflict began shows the corpse covered by a fresh dusting of snow.

Every year starting in early fall photo editors at The New York Times begin sifting through the year’s work in an effort to pick out the most startling most moving most memorable pictures. Recently every year seems like a history-making year: a pandemic that killed millions; an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol; and in 2022 a war with frightening echoes of the 20th century’s devastating world wars.

Although the war in Ukraine wasn’t this year’s only story it was the most dominant — photographers for The Times filed some 16000 images often in circumstances that endangered their lives.

After the shock of the invasion the photos began to change. Lynsey Tyler Hicks and David Guttenfelder fellow veterans of conflict coverage told us that the destruction of an artillery war produces too many similar scenes. They began seeking something different.

As the war ground on they captured a new mood in facial expressions: resignation but also resilience. A Ukrainian soldier on leave from the front lightly held his girlfriend as he placed a soft kiss on her forehead. In the village of Demydiv someone carrying a bag waded alone down a street that had become a river flooded by Ukrainians themselves to thwart the Russian advance.

By April it had become a war of attrition. Even big battles and major advances proved indecisive with both sides digging in for an extended conflict.

Looking at these images from 2022 it’s impossible not to see fragments of a different kind of war one being waged here in the United States with mass shootings taking lives seemingly every week. Sometimes the most powerful image is of an object that reveals that pain and tragedy like Tamir Kalifa’s photograph of a bullet-riddled notebook retrieved from a classroom in Uvalde Texas where 19 children and two teachers were killed. The notebook belonged to one of those children — Uziyah Garcia a 10-year-old.

There was also change on the social and political fronts. Ketanji Brown Jackson was confirmed as the first Black woman on the Supreme Court a moment caught in a magical photograph of Leila Jackson gazing at her mother in loving admiration. It was taken by Sarahbeth Maney who is also a young woman of color.

A gorgeous and powerful black-and-white photo of a pregnant woman in Ohio who had made the difficult decision to have a reduction — the termination of one severely unhealthy fetus to save the life of its healthy sibling — spoke to the anguish.

Hers was one of the last such procedures legal under Ohio’s changing law.

But 2022 undoubtedly belongs to the war in Ukraine a conflict now settling into a worryingly predictable rhythm. Finbarr O’Reilly’s image of an explosion on Kyiv’s skyline as Russia retaliated against Ukrainian advances with missile attacks on civilian targets shows the war as raw and low-tech because it is. Dumb bombs and artillery blow up buildings for the sole purpose of scaring people.

And yet moments of optimism and joy do arrive. A photo by Laetitia Vancon delights us with the sight of elegantly dressed teenagers dancing on a street in Odesa. We see what they have lost because of Vladimir Putin’s aggression against their country — but also what they refuse to lose.

With this collection we recognize our photographers for their outstanding work around the world and hope you will understand more about their thinking and their day-to-day processes as they explain in their own words how they got the story.

You can skip our detailed analysis of factors leading to a brand becoming overrated and its consequences and head directly to 5 Most Overrated Companies and Brands Heading into 2023.

Factors Leading to Brands Becoming Overrated

Brand-recognition strategies can be highly effective in increasing revenue. However a brand can become a victim of its own success due to factors that can be avoided. These include complacency rigid bureaucratic frameworks that arise as a result of scaling and other corrosive business practices like bad customer service.

However one core factor has specifically to do with luxury goods. Luxury companies price their products on value-based pricing which is tied around their wealthy customers’ perceived value of their products for social status. McKinsey a global management consulting firm stated that the luxury apparel industry is well-placed in the ongoing market downturn to outperform the rest of the clothing industry.

It puts the CAGR of luxury fashion at 5-10% in the US in 2023 since its core market comprises affluent customers mostly insulated from the impact of rising interest rates and inflation. However its Consumer Pulse survey also showed that more people from the luxury brands’ peripheral market have switched from top-tier brands to private-label products for lower prices than at any other time since the Covid pandemic began.

Impact of Brand Reviews

Overrated brands do not directly suffer from declining revenue at-least in the short to medium term. What they directly result in is bad customer reviews. Reviews play an important role in the global economy especially in the American economy where consumers are highly inclined to give their feedback about products they buy and use other people's feedback while making a buying decision.

A Quality Logo Product survey shows 85% of people trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Bad reviews can lead to a halt in the growth of customer-base and then eventually dwindling reputation may even lead to a decline in revenue due to customer alienation and the background inflation rate.

According to data from Statista 92% of potential customers are less likely to buy from a negatively reviewed business.

The reviews for most of these overrated brands and companies can be checked out on Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L) among others.

Our Methodology

We’ve ranked brands and companies based on the review ratings from Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L) a major consumer-review platform where consumers rate a company with stars with 5-stars being the best and 1 star being the worst. We’ve also accounted for customer service and general sentiment around the brands in question.

For major brands we’ve also discussed consumer survey results from sources like American Affluence Research Center and also considered brands from the book Obsessive Branding Disorder by journalist Lucas Conley.

Let’s dive in. Here's the 15 most overrated companies and brands heading into 2023.

15. Champion by Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI)

Trustpilot Rating: 2.5 (Poor)

Champion is a sportswear clothing brand owned and operated by the US apparel company Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI).

14. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)

Trustpilot Rating: 2.4 (Poor)

Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a Seattle-based multinational chain of coffee houses. The company is a household name due to its nearly 36000 coffee houses across the globe. It’s penetrated in pop-culture as well featuring in movies like Mean Girls.

However it has largely fallen out of favor with consumers who claim that it is overrated. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has a poor rating of 2.4 on Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L) based on 1565 reviews.

Majority of reviewers complained about low maintenance mediocre quality and unreasonable cost. Despite that Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is growing fairly well. Its YoY growth for fiscal year 2022 was 11% from the previous year.

It's largely due to the fact that famous (not necessarily popular) brands often end up becoming status symbols. For instance a University-of-Leicester study has discovered that consumption of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) food and beverages by the Chinese urban middle class is associated with status rather than quality of their products.

13. Dunkin’ Donuts

Trustpilot Rating: 2.3 (Poor)

Dunkin’ Donuts is an American doughnut and coffee company based in Canton Massachusetts. It has a poor rating of 2.2 based on 181 reviews on Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L).

Dunkin’ Donuts has also been featured in Obsessive Branding Disorder as an example of an overrated brand.

11. Victoria’s Secret & Co. (NYSE:VSCO)

Trustpilot Rating: 2.0 (Poor)

Trustpilot Rating: 1.9 (Poor)

The airline allegedly kept flying 46 airplanes for over 60000 flights without inspections for fuselage cracks as reported by New York Times. This resulted in a hefty $10 million fine by the Federal Aviation Authority.

It is the ninth on the list of most overrated companies and brands heading into 2023.

8. Supreme

Trustpilot Rating: 1.8 (Poor)

Supreme is a lifestyle clothing brand based in New York City and is one of the most overrated brands heading into 2023. Based on over 400 reviews on Trustpilot the company has a poor rating of 1.8.

7. The Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS)

Trustpilot Rating: 1.7 (Bad)

8. Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14

Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) operates as a resource company in the United States and Argentina primarily exploring for lithium deposits. The company was incorporated in 2007 and is headquartered in Vancouver Canada. In the beginning of November Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) announced plans to separate its North American and Argentine business units into two independent public companies. It is one of the best battery stocks to buy for next year.

On December 15 Piper Sandler analyst Charles Neivert reiterated an Overweight rating on Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $36 from $38. As a result of the high electric vehicle costs and a slight easing in the short-term lithium demand growth rate the analyst modestly lowered earnings estimates for the company.

Here is what Massif Capital has to say about Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:

“Lithium Americas: The volatility noted above in LAC has resulted in solid returns via our options trades around our core equity position. At the current time we are short calls on LAC as we have done multiple times throughout the position’s life expiring on May 21 2021 at a $17.5 and $22.5 strike price. The volume of contracts sold at each strike corresponds to the size of the equity position we want should the calls expire in the money and the underlying equity gets called away from us. The thought process behind this trade construction is that if we know the size of the position we want at a particular price point there is no reason not to accumulate additional returns by pre-selling the stock we would have sold anyway. High levels of volatility positively impact the price of options increasing the premium we can earn from selling covered calls. To date we have sold covered calls on LAC that have expired worthless four times yielding a roughly 7% return on the equity position’s current value of 71 bps for the portfolio overall. The outstanding covered calls appear to be trending towards a similar worthless expiration. If they do the covered call trades on LAC will result in us owning the shares with committed capital of -$0.28 per share. Although we believe in the fullness of time LAC warrants a $30+ valuation the prices achieved in early January of this year were not justified by the underlying fundamentals. Some will argue we should have sold down our position. We had already established our option positions and believe LAC is an emerging major in the lithium mining industry. Thus we decided to maintain the position unchanged. Although still relatively high the current $15 per share valuation is not crazy compared to where we think the firm should be trading based on fundamentals so we are no longer overly concerned with the position as is. LAC management also took advantage of the volatility issuing stock on January 22 for $22 a share. The ~$400 million in proceeds will be used to develop Thacker Pass the US-based clay lithium deposit which will likely be the largest producing Lithium mine in America when turned on. In our opinion the stock issuance could not have come at a better time. LAC management has advanced the project through various development stages (de-risking) but with the share issuance they have significantly reduced the need to bring in an outside partner to develop the asset as the first phase of the project is expected to cost roughly $581 million. After-tax and at an 8% discount rate the Thacker Pass project’s present value is approximately $2.6 billion (the firm’s current market capitalization is $1.5 billion). Although the share issuance was dilutive increasing the total shares by 17% we believe it will in the long run prove a forward-looking value-additive decision by management. The lithium market remains an area of interest and focus for us. This reflects our belief that the most exciting investment opportunities to capture secular trends in EV’s and batteries are found upstream in the mining industry. It is also a reflection that there is a greater diversity of lithium investment opportunities relative to other battery metals.”

Charging My 2022 Tesla Model 3 RWD While charging my Tesla Model 3 RWD which I've owned for 4 months now and with about 4500 miles on it I decided to calculate how many kWh my battery pack has. You can figure this out when charging your Tesla vehicle and using the charge statistics. Here's what mine looked at after charging from 20% to 60%: * I charged at a rate of 6 kW at a slow charger * I went from 20% to 60% * The amount of energy I received was 24 kWh This isn't an EXACT science because each percent equals a couple miles of range and thus I could show 24 kWh being charged when the next mile charges it could go to 25 kWh. There's no decimal value for kWh but there should be. Elon Musk can we get this? But this gives a pretty good idea. Here's the formula: I take 100 which is the 100% capacity of a battery. I divide that by the percent gained divided by the kWh added to my Tesla's battery. It looks like this: 100% / (40% gained / 24 kWh gained). Or to put it with just numbers: 100 / (40 / 24 ). Why this formula? Because the 40% charge gained and 24 kWh gained must be divided to get a total value which I call ""percent per kWh"". This percent per kWh is divided into 100 percent to give you the estimated size of your battery pack. As this percent per kWh goes up the total kWh of my battery pack will be smaller and signal battery degradation. As it stands it looks like my battery has degraded by 1% or less at this point. Back to the formula - in this case I get an exact number of 60 kWh for my battery pack. I've looked at some online sources and they say the Model 3 RWD for 2022 has a 60.5 kWh battery pack. If I take 60 / 60.5 I get about a .9% degradation of the battery so far after almost 5000 miles driven. But it's unknown if the true size is 60.5 kWh. I know my range is usually between 266 and 267 miles and was 272 miles when I first got the car. My calculations show a kWh anywhere between 59.5 to 60.5 kWh depending on how much charge has been gained. It appears I'm getting about 20 kWh per 33% of battery gained equaling just about 60 kWh or the 60.5 that I've seen online. This formula isn't exact but it is handy. I'd like to see Tesla use decimal numbers for kWh added to the battery so it's even easier to tell the exact battery capacity left. You may also be interested in:

kWh and the Future of Model 3 Standard Range Batteries The Tesla Model 3 RWD for 2021 and 2022 uses a different battery chemistry. It uses LFP batteries which are supposedly 2 to 4 times as long lasting and slower to degrade than their Nickel based counterparts. I would expect that even after a few hundred thousand miles driven that my degradation shouldn't be more than about 10%. Time will tell. I recently wrote about the future range of the Tesla Model 3 standard range. I said in 5 years that a standard range Model 3 would have about 326 miles and in 10 years about 391 miles. This assumes a 20% improvement in range every 5 years. I think Tesla should add a section called ""Battery"" to its center console that shows various statistics about the battery. They could also add this section to their ""Energy"" section as a new tab which would show the estimated total kWh of the battery using charge statistics like I've outlined. If Tesla is able to trim the weight of its vehicles there are advancements with tire technology and continued improvements in batteries then I wouldn't be surprised to see an over 400 mile range standard range Model 3 available by 2032. That would be incredible. And things just keep improving from there. I conclude that a new Tesla Model 3 RWD 2022 has about a 60 to 60.5 kWh battery pack.

That said when we learned that a dog used a Tesla Model 3 as a chew toy we thought it was a joke. However as you'll clearly see it really happened. Perhaps you could argue that it could have been staged but it honestly seems too real for that.

As the story goes a Model 3 owner was walking to her car with her dog when a pit bull began to approach. Apparently it didn't have a collar on. It ran after her and her dog and scratched her back. She was able to get into the car with her dog but then the pit bull started messing with the car.

It doesn't appear as if the pit bull is trying to be aggressive. It really looks as though it's trying to play. It's using the car's body panels as chew toys and the weather stripping to play ""tuggie.""

The Tik Tok user who posted the video is named Liv and she uses the Tik Tok handle @toodiesangelxx. It seemed strange to some people that she just sat in the car capturing video while the pit bull was clearly damaging her Tesla. You can see in the video that there's damage all over the car and it's not minimal. It looks like the dog even bloodied its mouth up as it tried to chew the panels and tear the weather stripping off.

People were actually commenting about why Liv didn't do anything to stop the attack. She posted a second video on Tik Tok to reveal more about what transpired.

The Tik Tik videos have now gone viral and the media has reported more of the story. The owner of the pit bull reportedly offered to pay Liv's medical bills and to pay for the cost of repairing the Model 3 which won't be cheap.

As always we encourage you to scroll down and leave us a comment. This particular story could be cause for some fun conversation."

After Meng Wanzhou chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies was detained in Canada in 2018 for allegedly violating US sanctions against Iran Beijing quickly detained two Canadians in China and blocked or slowed a slew of farm imports from Canada.

China has a long history of biting back when other countries adopt policies it does not like. In 2020 when Australia called for an investigation into the origin of the Covid-19 virus it was hit with duties and bans on barley wine wheat wool copper timber and grapes totalling over US$1.3 billion.

“China retaliates fully plus 10 per cent” said Jeffrey Moon president of China Moon Strategies. “They have consistent goals when they retaliate. They want to inflict proportionate pain avoid negative impact on China and want to claim deniability.”

01:36 AI chip maker ordered by US government to halt exports to China AI chip maker ordered by US government to halt exports to China

The relatively muted response from normally blustery Beijing after Washington announced restrictions on high-end semiconductors and chip-making equipment – a potentially huge blow to its economy youth employment and vision of a reshaped society under the Communist Party blueprint – has analysts and former US officials parsing China’s thinking even as they wait for the other shoe to drop.

Within days of the early October announcement Beijing issued a pro forma verbal response – terming the US restrictions “sci-tech hegemony” and a “malicious” violation of trade rules. But there has been little concrete resistance or lashing out.

“It is a puzzle” said Scott Kennedy a senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “On everything else they seem to have skin that’s thinner than Saran Wrap.”

Analysts say several factors appear to be at play. Beijing has a lot on its plate. The US announcement came a week before the hugely consequential 20th party congress – apparently driven more by Washington’s bureaucratic timelines than any desire to poke Beijing in the eye – during which President Xi Jinping secured an unprecedented third term.

On other fronts the leadership is grappling with a public health crisis after it eased “zero Covid” restrictions following protests in dozens of Chinese cities and infections soared. Xi has also returned to in-person global diplomacy with trips to Saudi Arabia; Indonesia for the G20 meeting; and Uzbekistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. And China is preparing for a major government reshuffle in March.

That said Beijing is fully capable of multitasking analysts said especially when it comes to expressing – and acting upon – its displeasure.

Washington announced the chip export restrictions in early October without warning to thwart China’s ability to stockpile chips of potential military use. These include a ban on high-end semiconductors and chip-making technologies with potential dual civilian and military applications prohibitions against US citizens working on Chinese practices and expanded trade blacklists of Chinese companies.

On Thursday Washington added Chinese memory chip maker Yangtze Memory Technologies Company (YMTC) and 35 other Chinese players in the artificial intelligence chip sector to the list effectively blocking their access to critical technologies.

The US is also pressuring the Netherlands and Japan to add their own restrictions on cutting-edge manufacturing equipment even as it faces some resistance.

A second possible factor behind China’s relatively muted response may be divisions among party and government officials and top industry executives – including those from national champions YMTC Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation and Chang Xin Memory Technologies – on how to respond.

“Officials in Beijing are likely still digesting the full impact of the 7 October controls on key companies … and coming up with a response focused on assisting the domestic industry” said Paul Triolo senior vice-president at the Albright Stonebridge Group.

“Beijing may also be reluctant to take a major public retaliatory measure before the visit of Secretary of State [Antony] Blinken to China early next year.”

Kennedy who recently met with Chinese and foreign embassy officials and company executives in Beijing said he heard widely divergent views on China’s ability to overcome the restrictions and about what counter policies it might pursue suggesting a lack of consensus.

“Although the Xi Jinping-led CCP has the image of a risk-taking rapid reaction force actually on a wide range of issues they seem to be highly tentative or unsure about how to proceed” Kennedy said citing policies related to Covid-19 the beleaguered property sector fiscal reform and property taxes.

A third and potentially the most consequential factor behind Chinese reticence may be China’s weak leverage. One of its go-to responses when angry – cutting off access to its huge consumer market – is not terribly effective in this case. China badly needs the high-end chips most of which go into exports or military technology and not domestic products. And it would likely come out worse in any tit-for-tat showdown making it difficult for Beijing to inflict proportionate pain.

Beijing’s inclination to hit back hard when challenged follows in part because it often plays well domestically and can be an effective strategy for getting its way particularly with smaller less powerful nations more easily intimidated.

While China has the legal architecture to intensify pressure on multinationals and foreign governments – including unreliable entity lists antitrust and anti-competitive laws review authority over global mergers and acquisitions anti-foreign sanctions and foreign direct product rules national security cybersecurity and data privacy laws – it has rarely used these against tech firms. In a couple of cases it has threatened to sanction US defence contractors without following through.

Blocking – or threatening to block – Intel Texas Instruments Micron Nvidia Apple and other US companies’ access to the Chinese market would further curtail chip supplies that China needs and scare away already skittish multinationals in other industries. This comes as China struggles to attract foreign investment its economy swoons on the heels of Covid restrictions and unemployment among new college graduates hits a record high.

A sledgehammer option where it does have leverage would be an export ban on rare earth alloys and magnets lithium and other minerals. China accounts for 63 per cent of the world’s rare earth mining 85 per cent of rare earth processing 92 per cent of rare earth magnet production and 60 per cent of lithium processing. These materials are vital for a wide array of hi-tech products from cellphones missiles and stealth aircraft to electric vehicles and wind turbines central to Biden’s climate agenda.

But Beijing would potentially face even tougher US tech restrictions and suffer a major hit to its global stature with such a move. When China limited rare earths exports after 2006 ostensibly on environmental grounds and threatened shipments to Japan after a 2010 collision near contested islands it faced global opprobrium and a World Trade Organization (WTO) challenge by the US Japan and the European Union that it ultimately lost.

“Beijing has few ready options to engage in a punitive symmetric response and the tools that are available all have major downsides like further poisoning the business climate for foreign firms” said Triolo. “With the economy already reeling from Covid lockdowns Beijing is eager to avoid making things worse.”

Short on punitive moves Beijing has mapped out longer-term strategies aimed at reducing its dependence on foreign technology.

It has improved funding pipelines for Chinese companies. And it is increasing support with a planned US$143 billion five-year subsidy and tax-credit package Reuters reported citing sources.

Analysts also expect Beijing to accelerate efforts to attract foreign expertise poach intellectual property acquire chips and manufacturing equipment through grey-market channels and pursue divide-and-conquer tactics to hive off more vulnerable US allies and avoid isolation.

China also has a history of exacting stealth retribution in ways difficult to pin down such as slowing down visas and trade flows enforcing debatable safety and health standards and enacting restrictive policies based on environmental or other difficult-to-quantify standards.

“I think China is taking a quiet approach” said Xiaomeng Lu geotechnology director at the Eurasia Group. “That’s how I would categorise their reaction so far.”

One closely watched area is China’s antitrust vetting authority. Intel has announced plans to buy Israel-based Tower Semiconductors for US$5.4 billion which would require that major global regulators sign off.

China potentially could drag its feet on approving the deal until it expired to punish the US chip maker. “And then maybe months later or years later the words will come out that the real reason is political” Lu said. “But at the time they will say we did our math the economic impact is the reason we’re blocking this deal or just not explain at all.

“That’s one very likely scenario.”

Another possible Beijing move would be to tweak regulations by for instance revising its energy efficiency standard for servers. These standards are updated regularly typically on esoteric technical grounds. But some industry watchers are concerned that the latest standards give older-generation computers – where China is stronger – better ratings than those powered by more efficient chips where US companies prevail in this huge market.

Beijing’s recent decision to file a WTO case  seen as a low-percentage move that could take years underscores its relatively weak hand in retaliating which could drive Taiwan South Korea and other tech allies closer to Washington Lu said.

But experts also cite the risk of tech competition going too far in this high-stakes face-off undercutting global investment R&D and long-term planning. Many sub-sectors are not militarily sensitive and having interdependent supply chains often lowers cost on both sides benefits consumers and can reduce tensions and potential conflict.

“You’ve got the world’s largest market and the world’s largest economy at loggerheads with each other that’s going to create a whole lot of tension” said Jimmy Goodrich a vice-president at the Semiconductor Industry Association. “What that’s meant is that firms increasingly are being forced to choose a side.”

Some analysts say China may be rethinking its long-standing use of blunt economic leverage as resistance grows. “Crass economic coercion is running into more headwinds than it used to” said Kennedy.

In recent months China has been taken aback not only by the relatively unified European opposition to its retaliation against Lithuania but also the way the West has closed ranks behind Ukraine even as Beijing supports Russia. And with recent more targeted US tech restrictions it finds itself with fewer cards to play.

“This is probably the most effective response to China’s industry policy that any US administration has ever introduced; we’re seeing real results” said Moon formerly with the Office of the US Trade Representative and a consul general in Chengdu. “China doesn’t have the option of inflicting proportionate pain because semiconductors are so import to China’s economic future and five-year plans and all the party documents.”

A unique feature of T cells is that they exist for long periods as naïve cells which are functionally immature non-dividing and metabolically inert with very low levels of macromolecular synthesis21. Upon stimulation through their antigen-specific TCRs they rapidly turn on gene transcription and protein synthesis. In the initial 24 h following stimulation CD8+ T cells increase cytoplasmic mass by approximately 4-fold indicating a rapid initiation of macromolecular synthesis before commencing a burst of proliferation with a division time as short as 2–4h2223.

We examined the functional maturation of eIF5a in OT-1 CD8+ T cells which express a single specificity transgenic TCR that recognises a peptide SIINFEKL from chicken ovalbumin. Western blot of cell lysates from naïve OT-1 T cells showed abundant expression of eIF5a but low signal with a hypusine-specific Ab (Fig. 1a b). Upon activation the abundance of hypusinated eIF5a increased by ~3-fold concurrent with a similar increase in expression of DHPS the enzyme that catalyses transfer of the 4-aminobutyl moiety of spermidine to eIF5a. The abundance of both hypusinated eIF5a and DHPS peaked between 24-48 h increasing ~2-fold above that of a control protein ZAP-70. Single-cell measurement of hypusinated and total eIF5a using flow cytometry (Fig. 1c d) corroborated the western blot and hypusine and eIF5a abundance was shown to increase by 4 h. Staining peaked at 24 h with ~7-fold increase in hypusination and 4-fold increase in total eIF5a a 1.5-2 fold greater increase of hypusine relative to total eIF5a which made it likely that both newly synthesised and pre-existing pools of eIF5a were hypusinated. 3H-spermidine was shown previously to label a single protein with a hypusine modification upon activation of human lymphocytes13. The protein was subsequently identified as eIF5a (previously eIF-4D24) and it is the sole protein in the eukaryote proteome to carry the hypusine modification.

Fig. 1: Hypusination of eIF5a is induced by T cell activation. a Naïve OT-1 lymph node CD8+ T cells were stimulated with agonist peptide SIINFEKL for the times indicated and a western blot of total cell lysates was probed with Abs for DHPS hypusine eIF5a and ZAP70 as loading control equal cell numbers were loaded in each lane. b Fold up-regulation and Hyp:eIF5a ratio were calculated relative to the 0 h time point after normalisation against ZAP70 intensity at the same time point. One representative of three independent experiments is shown. Lines in left panel: red Hyp-pAb; blue DHPS; green: eIF5a. Lines in right panel: red Experiment 1; blue Experiment 2. c Flow cytometric analysis over time are shown of OT-1 cells stained with Abs against eIF5a and hypusine.

Abrogation of eIF5a disrupts key cellular functions

Hypusination of eIF5a allows efficient facilitation of translation elongation in vitro16 and may be responsible for its cytoplasmic localisation25. However it is unclear whether or not the non-hypusinated precursor and deoxyhypusinated intermediate forms of eIF5a have any activity in primary cells. This question is important as targeting DHPS or DOHH as a means to inhibit eIF5a may not be an optimal strategy given that deletion of budding yeast DOHH had only a mild phenotype26 whereas embryonic targeting of DOHH in mouse was lethal27. Many studies utilise the drug GC7 to inhibit hypusination and function of eIF5a. GC7 is a spermidine derivative which competes with spermidine for binding to DHPS preventing the conversion of non-hypusinated eIF5a precursor to its deoxyhypusinated intermediate but it is undocumented whether GC7 has effects beyond inhibiting eIF5a.

Naïve OT-1 T cells were activated for 2 days and then either treated with GC7 for 2 days or transfected with CRISPR-Cas9 guides to disrupt Eif5a Dhps or Dohh genes. Eif5a KO cells were routinely recovered after 3d culture in cytokine IL-2 to maximise cell recovery while other KOs could be left for 4d. Time-course analysis further showed that the phenotypic changes of the knockouts measured by flow cytometry with antibodies against specific proteins (representative gating strategies shown in Supplementary Fig. 1) correlated with loss of the CRISPR targeted molecules (Supplementary Fig. 2a). CRIPSR-Cas9 transfection controls were targeted for the surface molecule Thy 1. Given targeting efficiency was maximally 80% both KO and untargeted cells from the same culture could be analysed by intracellular staining for eIF5a or hypusine to identify positive cells. Figure 2a shows a representative experiment with a mean percentage KO of Eif5a Dhps and Dohh of 38.4% 71.6% and 78.9% respectively. Depletion of eIF5a protein in Eif5a KO cells was confirmed by western blotting using FACS-sorted eIF5a positive and negative populations (Fig. 2b). eIF5a depletion has been shown to affect cellular proliferation1128 and this was reflected by the significantly lower cell recovery from cultures in Eif5a KO cells compared to control Thy1 KO cells. Similarly there was a decrease in cell recovery when hypusination was impaired in GC7-treated Dhps and Dohh KO cells but this was not as profound as for the Eif5a KO (Fig. 2a).

Fig. 2: eIF5a regulates cell cycle and autophagy. a FACS overlay histograms showing expression of eIF5a or hypusine assessed at d3 (GC7 and Eif5a) and d4 (Dhps and Dohh). KO of cell surface marker Thy1 was included as a CRISPR control. Cell Recovery column shows the number of cells recovered at the time of harvest for each treatment paired to their control treatment (mock-treatment for GC7 and Thy1 KO for CRISPR cells n = 4 independent experiments for GC7 7 for Eif5a 10 for Dhps 6 for Dohh). Cell cycle profiles were obtained from Hoechst 33342 staining. Mean percentage of cell cycle phases was plotted pairing positive and negative cells from individual cultures (n = 4 independent experiments for GC7 12 for Eif5a 7 for Dhps 8 for Dohh).

Cellular proliferation was examined in greater detail using Hoechst staining to identify phases of the cell cycle. Surprisingly GC7 inhibition of eIF5a hypusination resulted in cell cycle profiles that were distinct from those observed following knockout of Eif5a Dhps or Dohh. GC7 caused a pronounced cellular accumulation in S phase whereas Eif5a and Dhps KO cells tended to accumulate in the G0/1 phase of the cell cycle while knockout of Dohh showed no appreciable changes in the cell cycle profile (Fig. 2a) despite reduced hypusination. Thus loss of eIF5a and DHPS likely caused prolonged G1 or defective G0-1 entry while the deoxyhypusinated intermediate form of eIF5a in DOHH KOs was partially active possibly slowing progression through the cell cycle. In contrast GC7-treated cells accumulated in S phase suggesting that the drug has off-target effects on cell cycle beyond its impact on eIF5a hypusination.

Spermidine is a key substrate for hypusination and function of eIF5a and its loss impacts the autophagic flux in both B and T cells. Compared to young individuals T and B cells from elderly people have reduced autophagy which was reversed by the provision of spermidine through a mechanism involving eIF5a supported translation of the master transcription factor TFEB which regulates autophagy2930. KO CD8 CTL were treated with the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) or vehicle for 2 h and selectively permeabilised to allow detection of autophagosomal membrane-bound LC3-II30. Autophagic flux was defined as the MFI of LC3-II in BafA1-treated cells divided by vehicle-treated cells. Whereas GC7-treatment and Eif5a KO reduced autophagy to a similar extent KO of Dhps and Dohh did not affect autophagic flux (Fig. 2c). These data confirm that eIF5a is important for autophagy but appear to contradict data which showed that autophagy was reduced in Dohh KO cells30. The latter measured autophagy in immortalised KO MEFs so the discrepancy may reflect residual eIF5a hypusination sufficient to maintain the autophagic flux in our experiments or may lie with the different cell lineages used for the analyses.

After 3-4d culture in IL-2 T cells differentiate to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and we tested the impact of loss of either hypusination or eIF5a protein on effector function. KO cells were restimulated with antigenic peptide for 4 h to reactivate effector cytokine transcription and translation and labelled with puromycin during the last 20 min to assess global protein production. Incorporation of puromycin into nascent proteins was analysed by flow cytometry and showed significant reduction following all treatments (Fig. 3a b). In contrast the production of a specific effector cytokine IFNγ encoded by Ifng gene was most profoundly affected in Eif5a KO cells with the majority of the population falling in the negative gate and was less reduced in GC7 treated and Dhps KO cells while Dohh KO cells showed only a minor decrease in IFNγ+ cells. Control Thy1 KO cells showed no reduction in either total protein or specific cytokine production. Cytokine production was also followed over time and showed loss of IFNγ protein mirrored loss of eIF5a (Supplementary Fig. 2a). In contrast TNF production by Eif5a KO cells was comparable to control cells at d2 and showed only a small reduction by d3. Together these data indicate that the loss of IFNγ production was selective rather than reflecting a general shut down in cytokine translation.

We assessed whether transcription or translation of Ifng and Tnf mRNA was impacted by the KOs by performing RT-qPCR analysis on cell lysates from GC7/mock-treated cells and unseparated Thy1 Eif5a Dhps and Dohh targeted populations. In these experiments two separate CRISPR guide RNAs were used to target Eif5a increasing the KO efficiency to >80% comparable to Dhps and Dohh targeted cultures. In contrast to the non-restimulated control cells all cells restimulated with peptide significantly up-regulated Ifng and Tnf mRNA as expected (Fig. 3c). Dhps or Dohh KO or GC7-treated cells did not show decreased Ifng and Tnf mRNAs compared to control cells while KO of eIF5a reduced Ifng mRNA by approximately 30% and surprisingly increasing production of Tnf mRNA. We conclude that fully matured eIF5a is required for translation of Ifng and to a lesser extent Tnf but that loss of eIF5a also impacts transcription for example of Ifng likely via reduced translation of eIF5a-dependent transcription factors essential for cytokine production as discussed below.

We tested whether Eif5a Dhps and/or Dohh KO CTL killed antigen-expressing target cells (Fig. 3d). There was a three-fold reduction in specific killing after knockout of Eif5a while loss of Dohh had no impact and the Dhps knockout showed a slight improvement in killing in two independent experiments. Thy1 KO cells also consistently killed targets more effectively which was likely due to Thy1 being a highly glycosylated surface molecule which may negatively impact effector:target cell conjugation. The reduction in the killing capacity of Eif5a KO cells was not due to changes in the production of the key cytotoxic effector molecule Granzyme B as its production was unaffected by loss of eIF5a nor did it appear to be due to exhaustion of the CTL as PD-1 expression was unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

We further asked whether KO cells could respond to infection following challenges in vivo. OT-1 Eif5a Dhps or Dohh targeted cells (expressing CD45.1) were each mixed 1:1 with Thy1 KO cells (expressing CD45.2) and injected into wild type recipients together with ovalbumin expressing Listeria monocytogenes (LmOVA). Splenocytes were harvested 6d later and the frequency of recovered donor cells assessed (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Very few targeted cells were recovered from the infected mice compared to the Thy1-KO control cells irrespective of whether eIF5a was knocked out directly or its hypusination was impaired. Those CD45.1 knockout cells that were recovered were exclusively cells that had failed to delete the gene of interest (Supplementary Fig. 2b) indicating that for CD8 CTL cell expansion and/or survival in vivo the expression of eIF5a and its hypusination are essential.

Systematic analysis of eIF5a-regulated translation in T cells

The regulation of specific groups of proteins by functional eIF5a was assessed by incorporation of 4-Azido-L-homoalanine (AHA) in place of methionine into newly synthesised proteins which globally labels the nascent peptide pool. The advantage of this approach is that it directly measures the synthesis of new proteins in order to characterise the functions of translation factors more sensitively than total proteomics however it may not be as comprehensive at measuring mRNA translation as conventional techniques such as ribosome profiling. Eif5a KO and GC7-treated cultures were pulsed with AHA for 2 h and Eif5a KO and WT populations were separated by cell sorting for eIF5a following fixation and staining ensuring that untargeted WT cells were subjected to identical culture and labelling conditions as the KO cells. Following lysis of the sorted cells AHA-labelled peptides were isolated using copper-mediated Click chemistry with Alkyne agarose beads and nascent proteomes were identified and quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry LC-MS.

Single shot label-free proteomics of 12 fractions of pooled GC7- and mock-treated cells resulted in detection of 7529 proteins which served as a spectral library for all experimental mass-spec samples. Using this library 5953 proteins were identified as represented by more than 2 unique peptides (compared to 3682 proteins detected without the library). 3246 proteins were expressed in at least 3 out of 4 biological samples in all conditions (Supplementary Data 1). All these proteins were significantly enriched (≥5x more abundant) in AHA-labelled samples compared to the non-labelled background. Four biological replicate samples were used for each group (Fig. 4a left). iBAQ values were used to measure absolute quantities of protein and to compare between groups31. Blank in one sample was replaced by the average value of the other 3 samples. The iBAQ values were normalised by Vsn algorithm32 on NormalyzerDE33 and log2-transformed followed by a second normalisation according to the input cell number to allow comparison between groups (Fig. 4a right; Supplementary Fig. 3a b; Supplementary Data 1). Amongst the four sample groups (Mock GC7 Eif5a KO and WT) nascent proteins in GC7-treated cells were globally reduced by ~3-fold. This decrease in AHA incorporation was consistent with previous trial proteomic experiments using various ratios between GC7- and mock-treated input cells (Supplementary Fig. 3c) and therefore is unlikely to be caused by the input normalisation. 3D MDS plot of all nascent proteins detected between Eif5a KO and WT cells and between GC7-treated and mock-treated control cells (Fig. 4b) showed distinctive signatures separating the 4 groups with the largest source of variations (Dimension 1) separating KO/WT from GC7/Mock most likely due to formaldehyde fixation and the subsequent reverse crosslinking in the KO/WT samples. The second largest source of variation (Dimension 2) separated KO from WT and GC7 from Mock and is most likely reflecting manipulation of eIF5a activity. Differential expression analyses were conducted separately between GC7- and mock-treated cells and between Eif5a KO and WT cells. GC7 had a systematic effect on protein production with 2617 proteins down-regulated and only 5 proteins up-regulated (Supplementary Fig. 4a); while Eif5a KO had a more limited effect on protein production with 234 down-regulated and 216 up-regulated proteins (Supplementary Fig. 4b).

Fig. 4: Systematic analysis of GC7- or Eif5a KO-affected nascent proteomes. a Schematic indicating the groups analysed and the number of proteins identified. In total 5953 proteins (left) were detected of which 3246 were detected in more than 3 of 4 samples in all groups (n = 4 biological replicates). (Right) iBAQ values from each group were normalised using Vsn algorithm and then by the input cell number. Log2-transformed values of 3246 proteins in each sample after normalisation were used to represent protein abundance and plotted as violin plots. Center line median; box limits upper and lower quartiles; whiskers 1.5x interquartile range; points outliers. Colours: blue Mock; orange GC7; green Eif5a WT; red Eif5a KO. b 3D-MDS plot was used to visualise the difference between samples (left). The percentage of variance represented by each dimension is plotted on the right. c Group average of normalised protein levels for all detected transcription factors ribosomal proteins and translation factors were compared between KO and WT cells or between GC7- and mock-treated cells. Significantly (for KO-WT paired two-sided t test P value <0.05 absolute FC > 1.5; for GC7-Mock unpaired two-sided t test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction FDR < 0.05 absolute FC > 1.5) changed proteins of interest are annotated in black (down-regulated) or red (up-regulated) font while proteins not deemed significant by the statistical test but may still be biologically relevant are annotated in grey font. OT-1 T cells were stimulated with peptide for 48 h before CRISPR-Cas9 KO of Eif5a or incubation with GC7. Cells were labelled with AHA for the final 2 h of culture. Eif5a KO cells and untargeted (WT) controls were obtained from the same culture using FACS sorting. AHA-labelled proteins were isolated by Click-chemistry with alkyne agarose beads and digested with trypsin. Detailed data handling procedure is described in Supplementary Fig. 3a (n = 4 biological samples). Full size image

Clustering of GO terms using WebGestalt34 compared the down- and up-regulated proteins to all MS-detected newly synthesised proteins as background (Supplementary Fig. 4a b). Noticeably transcription factors ribosomal proteins and translation factors were affected by both GC7 and Eif5a KO but in different ways (Fig. 4c). Several key regulators of environmental responses cytokine and effector T cell functions including IRF4 ELF1 FLI1 NFκB1 STAT1 STAT3 STAT4 STAT5A STAT5B STAT6 and TBET (Tbx21) were down-regulated in their production in GC7-treated cells while in Eif5a KO cells only IRF4 ELF1 NFκB1 STAT4 and to a lesser extent FLI1 and TBET were negatively impacted. Production of cell cycle regulator E2F335 was down in GC7-treated cells but not in Eif5a KO cells despite both populations having impaired proliferation. In contrast the NFκB transcription factor RELA which is important for survival of proliferating T cells36 was significantly down-regulated in Eif5a KO cells but not in GC7-treated cells. Some transcription factors were up-regulated such as the memory cell survival factor FOXO3; while some were down-regulated in GC7-treated cells but up-regulated in Eif5a KO cells such as CNOT3 and CNOT8 components of the CCR4‐CNOT deadenylase complex which destabilises its target RNAs including cell cycle regulators3738.

Given the profound effect of Eif5a KO on puromycin incorporation we investigated components of the cellular translation machinery in the nascent proteome. Amongst the 71 detected ribosomal proteins 20 were up-regulated in Eif5a KO cells (Supplementary Data 1) while none was down-regulated. Up-regulation of specific ribosomal proteins suggest that ribosomes with alternative composition might be produced in cells in the absence of eIF5a which may preferentially translate a different subset of mRNAs compared to those in WT cells3940. Additionally down-regulation of translation initiation factors eIF3 components and eIF5 suggest the formation and function of the 43 S pre-initiation complex may be reduced41 while an increase in eIF6 would prevent the 60 S ribosome subunit from joining with the 40 S subunit42. Together these data illustrate a general reduction in protein production and an altered translation profile in Eif5a KO cells. All the aforementioned proteins were down-regulated upon GC7 treatment illustrating broader inhibition of protein synthesis in these samples. Polyamines are known to modulate both the efficiency and fidelity of protein synthesis by direct interaction with the ribosome43. It is possible that the eIF5a-independent effects of GC7 may result from its competitive binding to ribosomes displacing other polyamines present in the cell.

The direct effects of eIF5a on translation versus indirect effects following changes in transcription factor production were examined by next generation mRNA-seq of GC7- and mock-treated samples (Supplementary Fig. 4c and Supplementary Data 2). Although GC7-treatment has off-target effects independent of eIF5a these populations provided suitable quality RNA unlike RNA extracted from formaldehyde-fixed sorted eIF5a KO cells. Translationally down-regulated genes in the GC7-treated samples were defined as the 1417 genes with no significant reduction in RNA abundance but decreased in their nascent proteins (Fig. 5a left Venn diagram and Supplementary Data 3). These genes were overlaid with those reduced in their nascent proteins in Eif5a KO compared to WT cells (Fig. 5a right Venn diagram Supplementary Data 3) giving 86 genes whose translation not transcription we could confidently assign as being dependent on eIF5a. Proteins translationally down-regulated only by GC7 treatment were enriched in GO terms: structural constituent of ribosome mRNA binding rRNA binding and translation factor activity (Fig. 5b); while the 86 proteins translationally reduced by both GC7 treatment and Eif5a KO did not significantly cluster into any GO terms although some key genes regulating cellular functions such as T cell receptor signalling transducer FYN cytokine receptor IL2RG mTORC1 modulators SLC3A2 and SLC7A5 DNA replication factor RFC3/5 transcription factor IRF4 and translation factors eIF3F/M were in this Venn group (Supplementary Data 3).

Fig. 5: Identification of translationally regulated genes affected by GC7 treatment and Eif5a KO. a Venn diagram overlays identify 1417 proteins not reduced in their mRNA (FDR > 0.1 or FDR < 0.01 and FC > 2 edgeR n = 4 red dots in Supplementary Fig. 4c right) following GC7 treatment but down-regulated in their nascent peptides (FDR < 0.05 FC < −1.5 unpaired two-sided t test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction n = 4 biological samples). These proteins were further overlaid with those reduced in their nascent proteins in Eif5a KO cells (P < 0.05 FC < −1.5 paired two-sided t test n = 4 biological samples) as an extra criterion of selection for proteins translationally regulated by eIF5a (86 proteins).

Given published evidence that eIF5a facilitates translation through polyproline and charged amino acid regions of proteins the frequencies of previously characterised eIF5a-controlled 3-mer motifs (PPP PPG DVG DDG GGT and RDK10) were counted in CDS of the eIF5a-regulated gene set (Fig. 5c). Compared to the frequencies of 50 randomly selected 3-mer sequences PPP is enriched. PPG and DVG were possibly enriched but rejected by the statistic test (P > 0.99). To assess the polyproline content of these genes they were overlaid with a published list of genes in the mouse genome with PPP or PPG motifs in their coding region44. We plotted the percentage of genes containing polyproline in 2900 randomly selected genes in the transcriptome (repeated 1000 times) all expressed proteins detected by LC-MS and translationally down-regulated genes in GC7-treated or Eif5a KO cells (Fig. 5d). In GC7-treated cells the percentage of polyproline genes was similar between all expressed and translationally down-regulated proteins suggesting no enrichment for polyproline while the translationally down-regulated proteins in eIF5a KO cells had a noticeable increase in polyproline content (Fig. 5d) consistent with a more targeted inhibition by eIF5a in the KO versus GC7-treated samples.

We then focused our analyses and validation on some of the proteins involved in regulating T cell differentiation cytokine production and cell cycle progression whose translation we had identified as affected by the availability of mature eIF5a (listed in Fig. 5e) since defects of these cellular functions were observed in Eif5a KO cells. Moreover these cellular functions are the major age-related impairments described in CD8+ T cells45 and suggest impaired function of eIF5a may contribute to immunosenescence. Proteins were measured in mock-treated GC7-treated and Eif5a- Dhps- and Dohh-KO cells using flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 2a and 5a). Key results are summarised from Day3 Eif5a-KO and Day4 Dhps- and Dohh-KO cells (Fig. 6) and across 4 days of culture after treatment (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The abundance of mRNA for these genes were also measured by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 5b). IRF4 TBET and EOMES are transcription factors regulating production of IFNγ and TNF in T cells464748 and CDK1 interacts with different cyclins to facilitate cell cycle progression49. In agreement with the systematic datasets the abundance of IRF4 and TBET dropped in Eif5a KO Dhps KO and to a lesser extent in Dohh KO cells with no reduction in mRNA levels (Fig. 6b) which likely contributed to the decrease in Ifng mRNA in eIF5a KO cells. In contrast all KO cells had decreased levels of EOMES both in protein and RNA. CDK1 proteins decreased in Eif5a KO but not significantly in Dhps KO and Dohh KO cells in correlation with their RNA levels and their cell cycle profiles in Fig. 2a. Curiously cell surface levels of CD98 were increased in GC7-treated cells which may reflect an impact of GC7 on recycling of this protein and was apparently an eIF5a-independent effect of the drug since the increase was not observed in any CRISPR cells. Overall our validated targets agreed with the systematic datasets while also highlighting some difference in RNA dynamics between GC7-treated cells and CRISPR cells.

Spermidine availability affects eIF5a-regulated proteins

The polyamine spermidine is produced naturally in cells and its abundance decreases with age. Exogenous supplementation of spermidine has been shown to increase organismal longevity20 and restore age-related T cell functions in an autophagy-dependent manner19. In addition to being required for hypusination of eIF5a spermidine is also known for inhibiting the acetyltransferase activity of Ep300 and thereby inducing autophagy50. This non-eIF5a-dependent activity of spermidine may have contributed to discrepancies between cellular phenotypes of GC7 (a spermidine derivative) treated cells and Eif5a/Dhps KO cells. The influence of spermidine on eIF5a function in activated T cells was examined by adding an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor DFMO to the cultures for 48 h to block spermidine biosynthesis. Additionally DMFO-treated cells were supplemented with exogenous spermidine to overcome the block or were treated with GC7.

Quantitation of eIF5a hypusine levels reflected the predicted outcome of these treatments. The DFMO-treated cells had decreased hypusine which was restored to a level comparable to untreated cells by spermidine supplementation. Depletion of hypusination by DFMO was exacerbated by additional GC7 treatment (Fig. 7a). However when we examined the abundance of total and selected proteins whose production we identified as being sensitive to loss of eIF5a by flow cytometry an altered pattern emerged (Fig. 7b). Puromycin incorporation and CDK1 TBET IRF4 and IFNγ abundance decreased following DFMO treatment and were restored by exogenous spermidine addition indicating they are very sensitive to cellular spermidine levels. Combining DMSO with GC7 further decreased Puromycin incorporation and expression of CDK1 and IFNγ but did not further reduce the abundance of TBET and IRF4 protein. Interestingly although IFNγ production was affected by DFMO + GC7 and DFMO as reported recently for CD8+ T cells29 the protein was still detectable in all cells as opposed to Eif5a and Dhps KO cells where a significant proportion of the population produced no detectable IFNγ (Fig. 2b). In contrast TNF CD25 and CDC45 showed no decrease in expression following DMSO treatment but were reduced by combining DFMO with GC7 indicating that they are less sensitive to spermidine depletion (Fig. 7) despite showing some regulation by eIF5a (Supplementary Data 1).

Fig. 7: Restricting availability of polyamine spermidine to cells decreased eIF5a hypusination and some but not all eIF5a-regulated genes. a Inhibition of spermidine biosynthesis by DFMO reduces hypusine staining which is rescued by exogenous supplement of spermidine or further impaired by treatment with GC7. MFIs of hypusine from 5 independent experiments are plotted on the right (P values were calculated using unpaired two-sided t test). Centre line and error bars represent mean value ±SD between independent experiments. Lines: grey shaded -ve staining control; blue shaded untreated; red DFMO; green DFMO + Spermidine; orange DFMO + GC7. b Samples from (a) were stained for cytokines (IFNγ and TNF) transcription factors (IRF4 and TBET) cell cycle regulators (CDK1 and CDC45) CD25 (IL2 receptor α) and puromycin. c Pooled data of MFIs (from 4 independent experiments for Puromycin TBET IRF4 IFNγ TNF and CDC45; 5 for CDK1 and CD25) were shown in the lower panel. Statistical tests were performed against untreated cells (P values were calculated using unpaired two-sided t test). Centre line and error bars represent mean value and ±SD between independent experiments. P value colours: blue significant; black non-significant. a b OT-1 cells were stimulated with SIIINFEKL peptide for 2d and cultured in IL-2-supplemented media for a further 2d before culture with IL-2 only (Untreated) or IL-2 + 0.5 mM DFMO DFMO + 10 µM spermidine or DFMO + 10 µM GC7 for another 2d. Cells were restimulated with SIINFEKL peptide + Brefeldin A for the final 4 h and labelled with puromycin for 10 min before harvesting for intracellular staining and flow cytometry. Full size image

Together these data indicate that the maintenance of some cellular proteins such as CDK1 TBET and IRF4 are very sensitive to the availability of functional hypusinated eIF5a. On the other hand other proteins such as the cytokine IFNγ requires total ablation of eIF5a or DHPS in order to show a profound reduction in abundance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzIzNTIzNDVYMjIwMDI1NzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Loss of SLC26A3 Results in Colonic Mucosal Immune Dysregulation via Epithelial-Immune Cell Crosstalk,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352345X22002570 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzIzNTIzNDVYMjIwMDI1NzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0yNDg0My130gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A conserved MTMR lipid phosphatase increasingly suppresses autophagy in brain neurons during aging | Scientific ...,"Fly stocks genetics and conditions

Flies were kept at 25 °C or 29 °C on normal fly cornmeal nutrient. Strains were ordered from Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC) and Drosophila Genetic Resource Center Kyoto (DGRC) or were kindly provided by another researcher or generated and described by us earlier.

For immunohistochemistry and fluorescence microscopy w[1118] (BDSC: 5905) and UAS-GFP-2xFYVE (II) (BDSC: 42712) animals (crossed with Appl-Gal4) were used respectively. Endogenous GFP-Atg8a expression was described in Ref.31.

For western blot analysis w[1118] was used as control. For EDTP overexpression EDTP[GSV6] (DGRC: 202239) was used under the control of Appl-Gal4 (BDSC: 32040). EDTP[MI008496] (BDSC: 44782) was used as a hypomorphic allele.

Animals of w[1118]; 3xmCherry-Atg8 és w[1118]; + ; UAS-GFP-Lamp1 genotypes were provided by Gábor Juhász (Eötvös Loránd University Budapest Hungary). For lifespan assays y[1] v[1] Appl-Gal4; EDTP TRiP /tubGal80[ts] and y[1] sc[*]v[1] Appl-Gal4; eGFP TRiP /tubGal80[ts] (control) animals were created by crossing Appl-Gal4 tubGal80[ts];TM2/TM6B (BDSC: 7108) eGFPTRIP (V22) (BDSC: 41550) and EDTP TRIP (V22) (BDSC: 41633) animals. In case of another lifespan assay and for climbing assays animals with w[1118]/+; +; pleGal4/+ and w[*]/+; +; UAS-EDTP-RNAi/pleGal4 genotypes were created by crossing pleGal4 (BDSC: 8848) w[1118] eGFPTRiP (V22) EDTP TRiP (V22) and w[*]; UAS-EDTP-RNAi (III) animals which were a gift from Tamás Lukácsovich (Department of Developmental and Cell Biology University of California Irvine CA USA) and described in Manzéger et al.47. Flies were kept at 29 °C and dead animals were counted daily.

For lifespan measurements climbing assays and protein ubiquitination tests two different RNAi construct were used to downregulate EDTP expression. BDSC: 41633 (EDTP-RNAi(V22)) strain contains a shorter target sequence: CAG TAG TGT AAT AGT AAT CAA (Fig. S2B) while the other construct (EDTP-RNAdsRNA) contains a longer but different target sequence (Fig. S2B): ctc gag GGT ACC GGG AAA TGG ACT CTT CGG GCA AGT TGG GGG AGT GGG AGG TGG AGG CTC CTC GGG AAC AAC CGC CAC TGC CAC GCC TCT GAA CAG CAG TGC AGG AAG CAC CGG AAG TGA GGG TGT GGG CAT CCA AGC CTT TGT GAC CTT TGC CAA TCC CCT GCA GAC GCA ACA ACA GCA TCC GCT CCA GCA ACA ATA TCC CTC GCA GCA GAT GCA TCC CCT CCA CGC GCA ATA TCC CTC CCA GCA GCC ACA TCC ACT CCA GCA GCA GCA GCA GCA GCC ATC GCA ACA GCA ACC ACA AAA TAC GAT ATA CGA GGA TCA GTA TGA TAT CCA GCG AAT GCG GGA ATT GGT AAC GAT GGC CAA ATA TGC GAG ATG CCG TCA AAG ATT CGC CGT GCC TGT GAT TAT GTA TCG CGG AAA GTA CAT ATG CCG CTC TGC CAC GCT ATC CGT CAT GCC AGA AAC CTA CGG CCG AAA AGT GGT GGA CTA TGC CTA CGA CTG CCT GAG TGG CGG CAA TTA CAC CGC GCC AAA CGG AGA AGA GAA CGA TGC TGA CTC CAC GGA CGA GTC GCT GAT CAC CCA CAT GCA CGA CCA GGC GCA GTC GCA GTT CAG CTA CGA CGA AGT CAT CAA GAG TGA CAT CCA GCT GCT GCA TAC GCT CAA TGT CTC AAC CAT TGT GGA CCT CAT GGT CGA AAA CCG CAA AAT CAA ATA CTT CAT GGC aga tct.

For measuring mCherry-Atg8a-labelled autophagic structures UAS-mCherry-Atg8a transgene was applied kindly provided by Gábor Juhász (Department of Anatomy Cell- and Developmental Biology; Eötvös Loránd University Budapest Hungary) and described in Ref.48.

Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence microscopy on Drosophila samples

To determine Atg8a levels a GFP-Atg8a (p-Atg8a-eGFP-Atg8a) reporter construct was used31. Samples were prefixed with 4% formaldehyde (solved in PBS) and washed three times (for 10 min) in PBS. Nuclei were stained with 50 µg Hoechst in glycerol:PBS (4:1) cover solution. During measurement we used the same exposition time and magnification for all samples.

Fixation and immunohistochemistry were performed according to Ref.46. The following antibodies were used: anti-Ref(2)P 1:200 rabbit—a gift from Gábor Juhász Department of Anatomy Cell- and Developmental Biology Eötvös Loránd University Budapest Hungary49 and anti-Atg5 (1:500 rabbit Sigma Aldrich AV54267) anti-Ubiquitin (1:500 mouse Merck ST1200). The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500 Life Technologies A11008) anti-Mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500 Life Technologies A11001). Nuclei were stained by Hoechst dye (0.1 mg/ml Molecular Probes 33342).

Fluorescent microscopy on human samples

Fluorescent images were captured with a Zeiss Axioimager Z1 upright microscope (with objectives Plan-NeoFluar 10 × 0.3 NA Plan-NeoFluar 40 × 0.75 NA and Plan-Apochromat 63 × 1.4 NA) equipped with ApoTome and a Nikon C2 confocal microscope (with objective 60 × Oil Plan APO VC NA = 1.45). AxioVision 4.82 and Jmage J 1.52c software were used to examine and evaluate data obtained. We calculated Pearson's coefficients by Image J 1.52c for evaluating the colocalization of mCherry-Atg8a and GFP-Lamp1 particles.

Western blotting

Western blot samples were prepared from 10 female heads which were treated in 32 μl of Fly Lysis buffer + 32 μl 2 × Laemmli buffer. 15 µl samples were run on 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™ Gel and blotted onto Nitrocellulose Membrane (Kisker Biotech 40520100). After blocking with 3% Milk Powder (BioRad 170-6404 /Blotting-Grade Blocker/) dissolved in TBST membranes were probed with specific antibodies [anti-Tubulin (1:1000 mouse Sigma T6199) anti-Ref(2)P (1:2000 rabbit48) anti-Atg8a (1:2500 rabbit50) anti-EDTP 1:1000 rat22 anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase (1:1000 Sigma A8438) and anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase (1:1000 Sigma A3687) anti-rat IgG alkaline phosphatase (1:1000 Sigma A5153) and developed by NBT-BCIP solution (Sigma 72091). Each western blot analysis was repeated at least three times with independent biological samples.

Quantification of EDTP transcript levels

Isolation of total mRNA from heads of adult flies at age of 1 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 days was performed according to the Direct-zol™ RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research R2050) protocol then cDNA was generated by RevertAid RT Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Scientific K1691). Quantitative Real-Time PCR reactions were performed in a Roche LightCycler 96 Instrument (Roche Molecular Systems) with FastStat Essential DNS Green Master kit (Roche 06924204011). Quantitative measurements were repeated three times using newly isolated samples and each qPCR experiment contained three technical repeats. GAPDH mRNA level was used as an inner control. Forward (F) and reverse (R) primers were as follows: EDTP F: 5′-AAA AAG CTC CGG GAA AAG G-3′ and R: 5′-AAT TCC GAT CTT CGA CAT GGC-3′ GAPDH F: 5′-TAC TTC ATG GCC GTT TCC TC-3′ and R: 5′-AGA TCC CAA TCC CGG TAC TC-3′.

Determination of relative N6-methyladenine levels

Genomic DNA was isolated from Drosophila at different adult stages according to standard protocols (Thermo Scientific GeneJET Genomic DNA Purification Kits #K0721 and #K0722). Samples were digested with DpnI at 37 °C for 20 min then the enzyme was inactivated at 80 °C for 20 min then a PCR experiment was performed as described previously by Yao et al.42. Forward and reverse primers and PCR conditions were as follows. For Drosophila control: 5′-TGA GGA ACA TCA TTC TTG GCT C-3′ and 5′-CTA CGG GGA GCT GAT GTA CT-3′; 6mA EDTP: 5′-ACC GTT AGG TCA GAT CTA TCC AG-3′ and 5′-CTA CGG GGA GCT GAT GTA CT-3′. PCR: 95 °C for 30 s then 95 °C for 10 s and 58.8 °C for 30 s repeated by 30/50 (control/sample) cycles.

Climbing assays

20 adult flies (which were raised at 29 °C) expressing the transgene under the control of pleGal4 driver were anesthetized and placed into a vertical glass column (length 25 cm; diameter 1.5 cm). After 1 h of recovery period from CO 2 exposure flies were gently hit 5 times to the bottom of the column. The number of flies that reached the line at 21.8 cm height within 20 s was counted. Three series of two parallel measurements were performed in each experiment. Scores represent the mean number of flies that reached the top against the total number tested. Results are presented as mean ± S.D.

Lifespan assays

For lifespan measurements an equivalent number of males and females was used. Animals were transferred into fresh nutrient-containing vials at every second day. The number of dead animals was counted daily. Measurements were carried out with five parallels. Tests were carried out at 25 and 29 °C.

Statistical analysis

For statistical analysis of climbing assays lifespan measurements (mean lifespan) and fluorescence microscopy results were determined by using R Studio (Version 3.4.3). The distribution of samples (normal or not) was tested with Lilliefors-test. If it was normal F-test was performed to compare variances. In cases when variances were equal two-samples t-test was used otherwise t-test for unequal variances was applied. In case of non-normal distribution Mann–Whitney U-test was performed. For lifespan curve statistics the logrank (Mantel-Cox) method was used calculated with the SPSS17.0 program.

DAB immunohistochemistry and image analysis on human post-mortem brain samples

Ubiquitinated proteins in the autophagic-endocytotic pathway and autophagy impairment were observed by immunohistochemical localization of anti-myotubularin-related phosphatase MTMR14 antibody respectively. After deparaffinisation and rehydration sections were boiled in 0.01 M citrate-buffer solution (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven for 2 min (set at 900 watts) for antigen recovery. After blocking the endogenous peroxidase in 0.1 M TBS containing 3% H 2 O 2 for 10 min at 37 °C sections were washed for 3–5 min in 0.1 M TBS (pH 7.4) at RT. Tissue sections were next permeabilised and the background binding of antibodies was reduced in a blocking solution (0.1 M TBS containing 5% normal goat serum 1% BSA 0.05% Triton X-100) for 30 min at 37 °C. Sections were covered with the above solution containing either mouse anti-NeuN primary antibody (1:500 final dilution; Chemicon Billerica MA USA) rabbit polyclonal anti-MTMR14 primary antibody (1:100 final dilution; ab102575 Abcam Cambridge UK) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with the primary antibodies sections were washed for 4 × 5 min in 0.1 M TBS (pH 7.4) at RT. Negative control experiments were performed when the appropriate primary antibody was omitted. Sections were then treated with either biotinylated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:200 final dilution; Amersham Biosciences Little Chalfont Buckinghamshire England) in a blocking solution (where Triton X-100 was omitted) for 5 h at RT. After several washes (4 × 5 min) biotinylated streptavidin-peroxidase tertiary antibody (1:200 final dilution; Amersham) in a blocking solution (without Triton X-100) was applied to the sections overnight at 4 °C. Sections were washed again in 0.1 M TBS (pH 7.4) for 4 × 5 min at RT and processed for peroxidase enzyme histochemistry using Sigma Fast DAB Tablet (Sigma St. Louis MO USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sections were washed for 3 × 5 min in 0.1 M TBS (pH 7.4) at RT rinsed in distilled water for 1 min dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions covered with DPX mounting medium (Fluka 30 Buchs Switzerland) and coverslipped.

Digital images from sections of temporal cortices of 4 non-demented subjects (see Table S4 for ages sexes post-mortem delays and Braak stages) immunostained for NeuN were taken with a Leica DMLB light microscope (Leica Microskopie und Systeme GmbH; Wetzlar Germany) using a Qimage MicroPublisher 3.3 RTV digital camera (Surrey BC Canada). NeuN-positive cells (not shown) were counted with the use of the computer program ImageJ (version 1.47; developed by W. Rasband at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available from internet at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) as we published earlier (for details see Refs.3551. MTMR14 immunoreactivities were quantified in lipofuscin-free cytoplasm through use of ImageJ image processing software. A total of 134 cells from non-demented samples were analysed. Measurements were taken by two independent investigators and the density values were averaged.

p62/SQSTM1 fluorescent antibody staining on human post-mortem brain samples

Protein distribution was measured using immunofluorescent techniques using fluorophore‐ tyramide signal amplification method (Perkin Elmer Waltham MA USA). A BOND‐RX automated stainer (Leica Biosystems Wetzlar Germany) was used to prepare the slides for staining. Sections were “baked” (30 min at 60 °C) dewaxed using Bond Dewax Solution (Leica Biosystems 72 °C) and run through a heat‐induced epitope retrieval step (EDTA‐based solution pH 9.0 20 min at 100 °C).

Following this “pretreatment” slides were manually washed in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) incubated in 0.03% H 2 O 2 for 30 min to block endogenous peroxidase and washed again. Primary rabbit antibody raised against human SQSTM1 (HPA003196 Atlas Antibodies Stockholm Sweden) diluted 1:10 in primary antibody buffer (0.3% TX‐100 0.1% NaN 3  PBS) and added to the slides for overnight incubation in a humidified chamber at 4 °C. The following day slides were washed in Tris‐buffered saline (TBS pH 7.4)–Tween 20 and blocked in Tris‐NaCl blocking buffer (TNB) (0.1 mol/L Tris‐HCl pH 7.5 0.15 mol/L NaCl 0.5% blocking reagent Perkin Elmer) for 30 min. The secondary swine anti rabbit HRP conjugate antibody (DAKO) diluted 1:200 in TNB were then applied to slides for 30 min followed by a wash in TBS‐Tween 20. For the tyramide signal amplification slides were incubated with fluorescein‐conjugated tyramide diluted (1:100) in amplification reagent (Perkin Elmer) for 15 min at room temperature.

To quench lipofuscin autofluorescence in the tissue slides were counterstained with lipophilic Sudan Black B solution (1% w/v in 70% ethanol Sigma‐Aldrich St. Louis MO USA) for 5 min. The slides were then dipped in 70% ethanol followed by a PBS wash and coverslipped using an aqueous mounting medium containing a 4′6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI) counterstain (ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI ThermoFisher Scientific Waltham MA USA). Unless otherwise noted all steps were executed at room temperature.

Images were acquired on an automated VSlide slide scanning system (Metasystems Altlussheim Germany). Entire pieces of tissue on the slides were imaged with a 20 × objective (NA = 0.45 resolution 3.6 pixels/μm). Each field of view was captured at 3 z‐levels with a 1 μm interval to create an extended focus image. Acquired field of view images were stitched to create a complete overview with microscopic resolution. The emission spectra for the fluorophore‐conjugated secondary antibodies were as follows: Hoechst (420–485 nm) Cy2 (490–530 nm) Cy3 (550–570 nm) Cy3.5 (580–595 nm) and Cy5 (650–670 nm).

Quantification of MTMR14 transcript levels in human cortical samples

Total human mRNA samples were isolated from the temporal cortical tissues according to the Direct-zol™ RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research R2050) protocol then cDNA was generated by RevertAid RT Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Scientific K1691). Roche LightCycler 96 Instrument (Roche Molecular Systems) with FastStat Essential DNS Green Master kit (Roche 06924204011) was used for quantitative Real-Time PCR reactions. GAPDH was used as an internal control. The following forward and reverse primers were used: GAPDH: 5′-TCG GAG TCA ACG ATT TGG T-3′ and 5′-TTC CCG TTC TCA GCC TTG AC-3′ MTMR14: 5′-GTA ACG GGC TGT GGC AGT AT-3′ and 5′-TTC CCG TTC TCA GCC TTG AC-3′.

Measurement of human cortical MTMR14 protein levels

Proteins were isolated from temporal cortical tissues according to the standard sample preparation protocol for Western blot of Abcam. 15 mg tissue was homogenized per each sample in 600 µl lysis buffer (included RIPA buffer and protease and phosphatase inhibitors) with electric homogenizer. 20 µl samples were run on 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™ Gel and blotted onto Nitrocellulose Membrane (Kisker Biotech 40520100). After blocking with 3% Milk Powder (BioRad 170-6404 /Blotting-Grade Blocker/) dissolved in TBST membranes were probed with specific antibodies [anti-GAPDH (1:2000 rabbit Sigma G9545) anti-MTMR14 (1:500 rabbit Abcam ab102575) anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase (1:1000 Sigma A3687) and developed by NBT-BCIP solution (Sigma 72091).

MTMR14 fluorescent staining on human cortical tissues and quantification of reactions

Control human temporal cortical tissue was obtained from five males and one female (SKO20: 27-year-old SKO7: 55-year-old SKO19: 61-year-old SKO11: 77-year-old SKO16: 72-year-old SKO18: 85-year-old) subjects died from causes not related to any brain disease and had no history of any neurological disorder. Control subjects were processed for autopsy at the Department of Pathology Saint Borbála Hospital Tatabánya Hungary. Tissues were obtained and used in a manner compliant with the Declaration of Helsinki. All procedures were approved by the Regional and Institutional Committee of Science and Research Ethics of Scientific Council of Health in accordance with the Hungarian Law (ETT TUKEB 15032/2019/EKU).

Brain samples were removed 2–4 5 h after death both internal carotid and vertebral arteries were cannulated and were perfused first with physiological saline (1.5 l in 30 min) containing 5 ml of heparin followed by a fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde 0.05% glutaraldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 M PB pH 7.4 (4–5 l in 1.5–2 h). Temporal cortex was removed after perfusion and post-fixed in the same fixative solution overnight but without glutaraldehyde52. Subsequently 60 µm-thick coronal sections were prepared from the blocks with a Leica VTS-1000 Vibratome (Leica Microsystems Wetzlar Germany) for immunohistochemistry. Sections were washed in PB and immersed in 30% sucrose for 1–2 days then freeze-thawed three times over liquid nitrogen. Sections were processed for immunostaining as follows: after thoroughly washed in PB for five times endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by 1% H 2 O 2 in TRIS buffered saline (TBS pH 7.4) for 10 min. TBS was used for all washes (3 × 10 min between each antiserum) and for dilution of the antisera. For confocal microscopic investigations the incubation of primary antibodies happened simultaneously (anti-MTMR14 rabbit 1:500; ABCAM #ab102575) anti-NeuN mouse 1:2000; Merck #Ab377). After incubation secondary antibodies with fluorophores were applied (DAM Alexa488 1:500; Thermofisher #A-2107 DAR Alexa594 1:500; Thermofisher #A-2102) for 3 h then samples were incubated with DAPI fluorophore (1:10000 Sigma-Aldrich #D9564) for 2 h. For reducing autofluorescence samples were incubated with CuSO4 solution for 40 min or samples were treated with AER (Autofluorescence Eliminator Reagent; Merck #2160) in 70% ethanol for 5 min. After that samples were mounted in Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences #18606-20). To avoid any interaction with additional chemicals causing reduced fluorescent intensity quantitative measurement was carried out without AER. Samples were analysed by using a Nikon C2 confocal fluorescent microscope with 60 × oil objectives. ROI (region of interest) areas were defined from total width of the cortical layer 3 from temporal cortical (Brodmann’s area 38) sections. NeunN-labelled cells were photographed in their largest perikaryal extent. With this method ca. 30 cells were photographed from the 3d-layer of each cortical samples. NeuNm/MTMR14r/DAPI triple fluorescent confocal images were analysed by ImageJ 1.50b program. During measurements the three channels (green: 488 nm; red: 594 nm; blue: DAPI 470 nm) were visualized separately. Cytoplasm areas without nucleus or autofluorescent lipofuscin were determined using the NeuN (green) and DAPI (blue) channels. In these cells one or two 2–4 µm2 ROI areas were designated. Intensity was measured in ROI areas in the red channel corresponding to MTMR14 immunolabelling. Although the imaging parameters were uniform absolute intensity values were not comparable due to individual differences in the samples so a relative intensity unit (IU) was determined for each individual cell. As a reference intensity the relative intensity (measured as described above) of glial cells adjacent to neurons was used. The relative intensity was calculated based on the following formula: IU = (AI-RI)/(MI-RI) × 100 where AI is the absolute intensity measured in the cytoplasm of neurons RI is the reference intensity MI is the highest intensity found in the image. For images without identifiable glial cells the average of the RI values of the images of the subject was used for the calculation. For statistics the diagrams Statistica 13.4 program Microsoft Excell was used. The six subjects were divided into two groups as “young” containing the 27 55 and 61 year-old subjects vs. “old” containing the 72 77 and 85 year-old subjects. Normality of obtained IU values was checked by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Based on P > 0.2 values data were normally distributed so pooled intensity unit data of the two groups were compared by T-test.

Measuring MTMR14 transcript levels in the prefrontal cortex of dogs

Total RNA was isolated from canine frontal cortical samples stored frozen in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific #AM7021) by using TRIzol (ThermoFisher Scientific #15596018) according to the manufacturer instructions. Prior to immersing tissue pieces in TRIzol each piece was rinsed in 1 ml of sterile PBS in a new tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 500g. TRIzol was added to samples after removing PBS. Tissue pieces were homogenized in TRIzol by an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (Ika). Following homogenization RNA isolation took place. The quality of isolates was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and concentrations were measured by a NanoDrop device (ThermoFisher Scientific). Isolated RNA samples were stored at − 20 °C prior to cDNA synthesis and at − 80 °C for long term storage.

1000 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Maxima RevertAid cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific #K1672). Reverse transcription was performed using random hexamer primers. Then cDNA samples were diluted tenfold in nuclease-free water and kept either at − 20 °C or at − 80 °C. Quantitative Real-Time PCR reactions were performed in a Roche LightCycler 96 Instrument (Roche Molecular Systems) using commercial TaqMan assays and TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific #4369514). The canine orthologues of MTMR14 and GAPDH (internal control) are Cf02682018_g1 and Cf04419463_gH respectively. Reactions were run in triplicates in 96-well plates.

This mindset is what colleagues and students of Dr. Robert Van Til Pawley Professor of Lean Studies will remember about the chair of the industrial and systems engineering department who announced his retirement in the spring of 2022 after 38 years at Oakland University.

“We are born with a propensity to have fun doing certain activities and we are most productive creative and relaxed when we're engaged in things that give us maximum fun” Dr. Van Til elaborates on his life credo which he has perfected throughout his entire life.

Looking back engineering was not Dr. Van Til’s original career choice. As a high school senior he had his heart set on becoming a history and geography teacher. However at the time of his high school graduation in 1975 teaching had attracted many students who were seeking a deferment from a draft during the Vietnam War and job opportunities were rather limited.

Dr. Van Til when he first started teaching at Oakland University

“On my ACT I had to declare a major. I went through a list of majors and engineering caught my eye. My father was a mechanical engineer and it seemed like something I would enjoy doing” Dr. Van Til says while elaborating on the decision that led him to Michigan State University (MSU) for his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and later Northwestern University for his engineering master’s and doctorate degrees.

While attending MSU Dr. Van Til was securely employed as an engineer at General Motors a rather lucrative position with a guaranteed financial future. His heart however longed for something else — a meaningful contribution to a larger purpose that often accompanies conducting research while teaching new generations of engineers.

“OU gave me exactly what I desired — an opportunity to be a true professor. Big universities oftentimes prioritize research leaving teaching to graduate assistants while smaller schools don’t have a capacity for research. At OU I could be a researcher and a teacher at the same time” Dr. Van Til says.

In 1984 Dr. Van Til was hired for a full-time position at the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering teaching courses in controls. Soon after he began teaching courses in robotics and manufacturing under the Systems Engineering program.

“This program didn’t make much sense to me in terms of demand from companies and students. So after a number of years I got five members of our department to come together and form a new department which officially became the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) in 2005” explains Dr. Van Til. In 2007 its undergraduate program was accredited by ABET in both industrial engineering and systems engineering — one of approximately six programs in the U.S. with dual accreditation.

Initially the new ISE curriculum was based on the existing systems engineering program in manufacturing along with a few new courses. As time went by more courses and programs were added including a series of recent hands-on courses that focus on the operation and application of various digital twin tools. In cooperation with the Advisory Board ISE faculty also developed a curriculum to emphasize Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0. The department which graduated its first three students in 2007 now offers bachelor’s and master’s degrees in ISE as well as master’s and doctoral degrees in systems engineering. In 2022 more than 100 undergraduate and 150 graduate students were enrolled in the department’s programs.

ISE is a large part of the legacy Dr. Van Til leaves to Oakland University but not the only one. As a teacher Dr. Van Til believed the most important part of his job was to help students become successful.

“Academic material can be very hard to comprehend because the focus is often on too many technical details making it difficult to understand a bigger picture. Not every undergraduate or master’s student wants to become a Ph.D. student but almost everyone can be successful and enjoy learning. It is difficult to succeed unless you enjoy what you are doing” Dr. Van Til says.

Kimberly Romstad ISE ’14 industrial engineering manager at The TJX Companies Inc. credits Dr. Van Til with the life-long lessons of perseverance.



“I can't begin to describe the impact Dr. Van Til had on me as a student and as a person. From my very first time in his class to my graduation he has been there for me encouraging me to never give up on my dreams and goals. It is because of his belief in me I kept applying for an industrial engineering internship at Disney World (my dream job at the time) despite being numerously rejected. The internship was finally offered to me during my senior year and I had a lot of fun working there” Romstad shares.

Since having fun is a key element of happiness it extends well beyond Dr. Van Til’s research teaching and leadership endeavors. It permeates all areas of his life. His childhood love of history and geography has resulted in extensive world traveling. Over his lifetime Dr. Van Til and his wife Cindy visited 30 countries on five continents.

Dr. Van Til plans spending his retirement traveling playing golf and interchangeably residing in Michigan and Hawaii. His retirement goal is simple – to have fun!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwtd29ybGQvd29tYW4tc3RlYWxzLXRvcC1wcml6ZS1sb3R0ZXJ5LXRpY2tldC1hdC13aGl0ZS1lbGVwaGFudC1wYXJ0eS_SAWhodHRwczovL2ZveDU5LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsLXdvcmxkL3dvbWFuLXN0ZWFscy10b3AtcHJpemUtbG90dGVyeS10aWNrZXQtYXQtd2hpdGUtZWxlcGhhbnQtcGFydHkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woman ‘steals’ top-prize lottery ticket at white elephant party,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox59.com/news/national-world/woman-steals-top-prize-lottery-ticket-at-white-elephant-party/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwtd29ybGQvd29tYW4tc3RlYWxzLXRvcC1wcml6ZS1sb3R0ZXJ5LXRpY2tldC1hdC13aGl0ZS1lbGVwaGFudC1wYXJ0eS_SAWhodHRwczovL2ZveDU5LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsLXdvcmxkL3dvbWFuLXN0ZWFscy10b3AtcHJpemUtbG90dGVyeS10aWNrZXQtYXQtd2hpdGUtZWxlcGhhbnQtcGFydHkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Special to Ashland Times-Gazette

ASHLAND ‒ Farm toys collectibles and agricultural memorabilia make unique Christmas gifts.

That's a big reason behind the scheduling of the annual Ashland FFA Alumni Farm Toy Show. It returns from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday (Dec. 18) at Mozelle Hall at the Ashland County Fairgrounds.

""My daughters come to the show and ask me what I want for Christmas"" said vendor Roger Rhine.

""That's why we chose this time of year"" said Rick Shoup who runs the event on behalf of more than 100 Ashland High School FFA alumni members. It's a major fundraiser to send students to contests and conferences.

Last year's coverageAshland FFA Alumni Farm Toy Show returns

""This is our 33rd year"" he said noting Mozelle Hall will be ""pretty well filled"" with about 120 tables.

Items at the annual Ashland FFA Alumi Toy Show

Vendors come from Ohio but also from outside the area including Michigan and New York.

They sell ""mostly farm toys but also some construction toys and some memorabilia"" Shoup said.

Toys may be a misleading term. Although children can enjoy acquiring ""newer plastic type of stuff or something older beyond restoring but still functional to play with"" vendor Bob Platt said serious collectors can find what they are seeking in scale models of tractors and trucks.

""Typically kids might not be able to spend the big money"" for some of the more expensive collectibles Platt said but ""high school students are starting to realize (their) value.""

Many tractors are built from 1/16 to 1/64 scale are die-cast and look like the real thing.

Restoration of older models is possible with parts to fix whatever pieces need repaired.

Dealers specialize in different brands of agricultural equipment and implements. If a buyer can't find a model that looks like one they want it can be custom-made.

Also for sale will be memorabilia such as yardsticks paper advertisements brochures and even a milk bottle from Ashland and the surrounding area Platt said. ""Collectors are looking for that.""

Inventory will encompass vintage signage and NASCAR items Shoup said.

Agricultural dioramas will be on display and refreshments including barbecue pork and hot dogs will be available.

The spirit of agriculture

Many of the items available can't be purchased at Walmart or a farm supply store Platt noted.

Parents attend to buy tractors and trucks for their children while adults frequently make purchases for their collections Shoup said.

""It's a pretty good mix. Most (customers) bring their family. That's what it's all about"" Rhine said.

The show itself embodies the spirit of the season by using proceeds to pay student expenses for hotel stays and transportation to contests said the high school's FFA adviser Tod Fox.

The program has been getting larger Fox said growing to more than 200 Ashland High and Middle School participants.

Hands-on experience encompasses work with small engines landscaping animals and the greenhouse.

""We had 244 sign up this year"" he said adding students attend 15-20 contests in a variety of areas each year.

""We cover kids' costs for competition"" he said. The alumni ""are amazing for all of our kids. The kids and myself appreciate all they do.""

Along with fundraising ""they donate a lot of time to contests and judging.""

In return Ashland High School FFA members help with the farm toy show by setting up hauling merchandise and working in the concession stand.

""We always want to show our appreciation to the alumni who do so much for us"" Fox said. ""Without them we wouldn't be able to do what we do.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY2l0eW1lbnVzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzE4L3RyYWZmaWMtZmxvdy1pbXByb3ZlbWVudHMtY29taW5nLXRvLXRob21hcy1jcm9zc3JvYWRzLWNoaWNrLWZpbC1hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Traffic Flow Improvements Coming to Thomas Crossroads Chick-fil-A,"Some parking lot and drive thru changes are coming to a Coweta County Chick-fil-A in order to improve traffic flow. Construction plans were discovered last week for the Thomas Crossroads location at 5 Glenda Trace. The plans appear to show the removal of some landscaping and a rebuild of parking spaces to be further away from the drive thru area.

According to the plans a meal delivery canopy will be built near the front of the restaurant. Dedicated ingress/egress lanes will be located at the rear of the restaurant across from the dental office. No word on when construction will begin or will be completed.

Their advertisements show guests of varying ethnic backgrounds gathering happily in sunny houses seeming to feel at home — or even better on vacation.

But some people of color — particularly Black guests — say that despite the policies and partnerships that home-sharing platforms have put into place they still face discrimination when booking or staying in vacation rentals. They are frustrated by what they say is a lack of understanding and accountability.

In a report released on Tuesday Airbnb acknowledged the issues and provided the first public data on the steps it has taken to reduce racial disparities including removing some human factors from the booking process.

The Thalys did not run for a while on Saturday due to black ice. However travelers should still expect delays on Saturday.

The problems mainly occurred in Belgium. The Thalys can now run there again but because the train first has to return to the Netherlands from Brussels according to the NS it may take a while before people can really travel again.

Travelers are advised to keep an eye on the international travel planner and the information at stations to determine when the train will run again.

Meanwhile Belgian rail operator Infrabel reported that international train services (Thalys TGV and Eurostar) between Brussels and France were interrupted by the freezing cold according to the Belga news agency.

The malfunction was caused by a Thalys and a TGV that were stopping near Ruisbroek due to ice on the overhead lines according to Infrabel.

At the moment the Belgian rail operator is busy repairing the fault. Passengers on the stopped trains are being evacuated."

The company expects its ready-to-cook products’ brand Godrej Yummiez to cross the ₹200 crore-mark on retail sales by the end of this fiscal year.

Abhay Parnerkar Chief Executive Officer Godrej Tyson Foods Ltd said “ The frozen ready-to-cook category has really taken off in a big way post the pandemic with consumers seeking convenience along with hygiene and safety. It is a highly under-penetrated category in India compared to other markets and has been witnessing strong growth. We are focusing on both portfolio as well as distribution expansion to tap into this growth potential.”

The company for instance recently expanded its vegetarian frozen food portfolio with the launch of Godrej Yummiez Crispy Potato Starz. “ Besides expanding our addressable market the recent launch has also enabled us to offer more affordable products from the vegetarian frozen snacks perspective. Today 55 per cent of our portfolio is non-vegetarian and 45 per cent is vegetarian. Even in the non-vegetarian segment we are trying to find the right kind of pack sizes which will allow us to offer products at more affordable price points” he added.

On distribution expansion the company is looking at growing the reach of the brand in tier-2 and tier-3 markets with a carefully curated range. “ Even in the metros and tier-1 cities there is still a huge potential for us to further strengthen our distribution” he added.

Responding to a query on revenues “ We expect the brand to end the fiscal with over ₹200 crore in retail sales and garnering a growth of about 30 per cent” Parnerkar stated.

The company added that e-commerce has emerged as a high growth channel including the quick commerce platforms catering to the impulse consumption occasions. Godrej Yummiez portfolio consists of over 50 veg and non-veg products including Nuggets Burger Patties Salami Sausages Kababs Sweet Corn and Green Peas among others. The frozen foods segment in India is pegged at about ₹3500 crore and has been witnessing accelerated growth in the past 2-3 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFydGZvcnVtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlYm9yYWgtd2lsbGlzLWF3YXJkZWQtMjAwMDAwLXByaXplLWJ5LWNyeXN0YWwtYnJpZGdlcy1tdXNldW0tMjUyMzg0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deborah Willis Awarded $200000 Prize by Crystal Bridges Museum,"New York-based photographer curator and historian Deborah Willis has been announced as the recipient of the $200000 Don Tyson Prize for the Advancement of American Art.

""I don't think about legacy too much"" he said.

Cecere 62 who has worked at the company for decades and took the helm in 2017 sat down with the Star Tribune this month just a few days after U.S. Bank closed its $8 billion acquisition of MUFG Union Bank its biggest deal since 2001.

After deregulation opened up interstate banking in the late 1980s U.S. Bank aggressively bought other banks to build itself into the nation's fifth-largest bank. Its biggest deal came in 2001 a $21 billion combination with Milwaukee-based Firstar Corp.

With the purchase of MUFG Union Bank it joined a more recent wave of bank mergers driven by another phenomenon: the arrival of digital services. U.S. Bank increased its assets by more than 10% and becomes a much more significant player in California the nation's most populous state.

The deal took several months longer than anticipated to get the green light from U.S. regulators. But now that it has the company is planning to convert MUFG Union Bank's 300 branches to the U.S. Bank name over Memorial Day weekend. They will join a network of about 2200 U.S. Bank branches.

Some excerpts from the conversation:

Q: What appealed to you most about buying MUFG Union Bank?

A: It is a positive for almost every constituency that you think about. So first of all from a customer standpoint this will be a great advancement in digital capabilities and products and services versus what (Union Bank customers) currently have. ... From a community standpoint we signed a $100 billion community benefits plan. I'm convinced that the communities will be better because of that. ... From a bank standpoint this is a positive transaction because we're in an environment where the importance of scale has never been more relevant. And this gives us a step function increase in scale. We add a million customers. We add 200000 small businesses. And we do it in a way that's quite efficient.

Q: Is scale more important now today than it was before the shift to digital banking?

A: It's more relevant today because of technology. If you are a $10 billion bank or a $700 billion bank you need to build a digital app. If you're able to leverage your size by putting your customers in a digital app that's where scale becomes important. That's number one. Number two is we're in an environment where U.S. Bank is not competing just with other banks. We're competing with other technology platforms — the likes of Apple and Amazon and Google — that also have electronic financial services capabilities.

Q: California is already your largest market right?

A: It is from a branch standpoint. ... We have about 450 branches in California. We're going to go from about 10th or 11th in terms of market share to top five. So that's going to be quite important. So we'll be able to leverage our marketing our presence our brand in a much more effective way by being a top five player [in California].

Q: Do you foresee moving some corporate functions out west?

A: I don't expect that. We're going to have community leaders like we do in all markets where we have people represent us in the markets that we serve. But our corporate headquarters will continue to be the Twin Cities — and Minneapolis specifically. I've been coming downtown for 37 years. So this is my home. We have 13000 employees in Minnesota. We have over 100 branches. It is our corporate headquarters. Most of our senior staff is here. And I personally and we at U.S. Bank are committed to Minneapolis and the Twin Cities.

Q: How did this deal with MUFG Union Bank come about?

A: We had an investment services transaction ... with them. So we knew the management very well. Union Bank has always been on our list. If you think about the California marketplace — and I told you how important California is — there are only a few banks that could be a meaningful move for us there in California. Union Bank certainly was one of them.

So we got in touch and we worked together in getting in touch with the Japanese ownership and the CEO. We had a number of discussions. What was important to them is a partnership. And that's what this is. This is a partnership. And this is a partnership in the sense that they're retaining their corporate business and institutional business that will be managed out of New York. I would expect that we'll have continued relationships with them in terms of serving their institutional and corporate customers while we take on their retail and small-business customers.

Q: So it sounds like you approached them.

A: We got together is the way I would say that. We were able to talk to each other and it came about over a period of time. It was interesting. It was all during the COVID period. So it was all via calls. And and given that Tokyo has a 12 or 13 hour time difference it was often an early morning call or a late night call.

Q: It took a little bit longer to close the deal than you were expecting.

A: It did ... I think it was just a function of the environment that we're in and there were some regulatory chairs that were yet to be filled. And all those played into the timeframe being extended a bit.

Q: Some analysts were beginning to wonder if the deal was going to go through. Were you worried?

A: Worried would not be the term. As deals get extended there's more risk by extension. There's the uncertainty of the employee base which you can completely understand. They don't know what their ultimate outcome will be. There's the uncertainty of the customer base. We had a number of community discussions. And there's the uncertainty of the community benefits plan. So all those things created uncertainty. I believed that the fundamentals of the deal and the benefits of the deal were were sound enough that ultimately it was going to get approved.

Q: Do you think this will be your major legacy as CEO?

A: I don't think about legacy too much. But I think about what's best for the bank and the customers and the employees. And I think this is a real positive for all the reasons I talked about. I think the other thing it's done it's really brought together our team in terms of this great opportunity in this step function we're going to achieve. We've had multiple hundreds of people working on this transaction for the last year and a half. And they've done an outstanding job dealing with the data process with the community benefits plan with the financial integration with the customer capabilities with the digital infrastructure all those things. The team has done a tremendous job.

Q: Do you see this era of bank mergers slowing down at all or do you think it's going to continue?

A: When I started in banking there were 15000 banks. And today there are just under 5000 banks. I think there will always be thousands of banks. But I do think the importance of recognizing the requirements for technology and scale will drive additional consolidation. But there will always be just like there have always been small community banks and midsize banks and large banks. I just think there'll be fewer of them.

Q: Are you hoping to have more of a national presence?

A: That's not an objective. We're in 26 states as you know. The objective is to serve the communities in the best possible way to have the best product products and services for the customers that we serve and to serve those markets. But we're not looking to try to get into each state or anything of that sort.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vY2xhcmsuY29tL2NyZWRpdC1jYXJkcy91cy1iYW5rLXZpc2EtcGxhdGludW0tY2FyZC1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card Review: 18 Months of 0% APR Purchases and Transfers,"If you’re looking for a credit card with an introductory rate of 0% APR the U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card offers a couple of ways for you to carry a balance temporarily — without racking up any interest.

We’ve compared the U.S. Bank Visa Platinum Card to the best cards in these segments of the market. And we’ve determined that it’s a viable choice for those seeking a 0% APR period on both new purchases and balance transfers because of its long introductory period.

As you’re making your decision on whether the U.S. Bank Visa Platinum Card is a fit for you please use Team Clark’s review of the card in conjunction with Clark Howard’s 7 Rules for Using Credit Cards.

What Is the U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card?

The U.S. Bank Visa Platinum Card is a credit card known for its generous 18-month introductory 0% APR periods for both new purchases and balance transfers (afterward the variable APR will be 18.99% – 28.99% based on creditworthiness).

The card carries no annual fee but it does not have a rewards program to incentivize purchases.

U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card: Specs and Perks

Before we get too far into whether or not this credit card is the right choice for you let’s take a look at the fine print to examine some of the card’s perks and drawbacks:

Cardholder Benefits and Perks

Welcome Period for New Purchases: There is a 18-month introductory period for 0% APR on new purchases. This means you could potentially spend — without interest — for nearly two years if you maintain your minimum payments and pay off the balance before the conclusion of the welcome period. Afterward the variable APR will be 18.99% – 28.99% based on creditworthiness.

Optimal Uses for the U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card

The U.S. Bank Visa Platinum Card is versatile enough to be a potential add for consumers who are in different stages of their financial lives.

Let’s take a look at some of the strategies for getting the most from this card:

Advertisement

As a 0% Purchasing Card

If you’re not carrying any credit card debt and are looking to make a significant purchase soon this U.S. Bank card could be an attractive option.

With such a long 0% APR period a new cardholder could have the better part of two years to pay off the balance on this card before the first dollar of interest will come due.

For example you could make a large purchase — such as a $3000 riding lawn mower — and pay it off with 20 $150 payments for the duration of the introductory 0% APR period.

As a Balance Transfer Card

If you already have a credit card balance you probably have your eyes on the generous balance transfer offer that comes with this card. U.S. Bank matches the 18-month period for 0% APR on new purchases with the same term for 0% APR on a balance transfer. Afterward the variable APR will be 18.99% – 28.99% based on creditworthiness.

But before you apply and start moving your money around there are a couple of things to consider.

First you must move balances to the U.S. Bank card within the first 60 days of card membership to get the promotional rate. So you’ll need to move quickly once you get the card.

Next you’re going to need to do a little math to make sure a balance transfer is a right move for your balance.

U.S. Bank charges 3% (or a minimum of $5) on all balance transfer transactions whichever is greater. So if you’re looking to move $3000 in credit card debt you’re going to owe $100 in transfer fees. Depending on the interest charges you’re paying with your current credit card it’s likely that you’d still save money over the next 18 months. But if you have a shorter payoff plan that may not be a given.

You can use this handy tool from Capital One to measure a payoff amount for your current credit card balance to see if a balance transfer is the best decision for you.

Clark Does Not Recommend Using It For Both Balance Transfers and New Purchases

Since U.S. Bank is simultaneously offering welcome periods for new purchases and balance transfers it could be tempting to take advantage of both offers.

Clark advises against that type of strategy because a person taking advantage of the 0% APR period for new purchases typically has a different financial situation from someone who needs to make a sizeable credit card balance transfer.

If you have an existing credit card balance in need of transfer Clark wants you to focus on eliminating that debt as soon as possible.

“I don’t want people to have a mixed message that while they’re paying off a balance they are getting rewards on additional purchases. I want the focus to be 100% on being credit-card debt free and not being lured in by a reward you may get for continuing your credit-buying habit” Clark says.

U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card vs. Bank of America Cash Rewards: Which Is Better?

Both the U.S. Bank Visa Platinum and the Bank of America® Cash Rewards Credit Card made Team Clark’s list of the best 0% APR cards on the market. And they’re both offerings from major bank brands where many readers already do their day-to-day banking. So we decided to take a closer look at the two to see which may be the best fit in the category.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the key characteristics of the cards:

Card Feature U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card Bank of America® Cash Rewards Credit Card Introductory 0% APR Period on New Purchases 18 months 15 months Introductory 0% APR Period on Balance Transfers 18 months 15 months Annual Fee $0 $0 Cash Back Rewards None 3% on category of choice; 2% at grocery stores; 1% everywhere else Welcome Bonus None $200 with $1000 spending in first 90 days Free Credit Monitoring Yes TransUnion Yes FICO Cell Phone Protection Yes No

As you can see the main difference in these cards is the length of the introductory period and the stark contrast in rewards. If you’re in the market for a longer 0% APR period for paying down some debt the U.S. Bank card may be the choice. If you’re interested in using the card frequently after the introductory period the Bank of America card is much more inviting with its cash back rewards structure.

Final Thoughts

Are you considering adding the U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card to your wallet? Let’s review some of the major pros and cons of the card before you make your final decision:

Pros Cons Generous intro APR period on purchases and transfers No rewards program $0 annual fee No welcome bonus Cell phone protection plan Very vanilla cardmember perks

Bottom Line: U.S. Bank is using a long introductory period on balance transfers and new purchases to lure new cardmembers. If you need an extended period of time to pay off a balance this card could provide the cushion that you need to get your finances in order. However if you’re planning on using the card for an everyday spender you’re going to be disappointed in the lack of a rewards program. Many other cards on the market could give you a better return on your spending.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmR5c3Rhci5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L3Nwb3J0cy9uZmwvY29sdHMvMjAyMi8xMi8xNy9jb2x0cy12aXNpdC12aWtpbmdzLW5mbC13ZWVrLTE1LWFjdGlvbi1tYXR0LXJ5YW4ta2lyay1jb3VzaW5zLWp1c3Rpbi1qZWZmZXJzb24tam9uYXRoYW4tdGF5bG9yLzEwOTE2NTk3MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colts visit Vikings in NFL Week 15 action,"Colts visit Vikings in NFL Week 15 action

U.S. Bank has a credit card that matches that rate of return each quarter but puts you in the driver’s seat to a degree on how you earn the rewards.

The U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card lets you choose the 5% cash back spending categories for your card each quarter.

This level of customization is nice but does that make it the best cash back card for your wallet?

In this article Team Clark will take a deeper dive into the U.S. Bank offering and compare it to its top competitors in the category.

Table of Contents

Team Clark has spent time evaluating the credit card market in several categories including the best cash back credit cards. We’ve compared the U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card to the best cards in this segment of the market. And we’ve determined that it’s a viable choice — thanks to its bonus cash back categories and the fact that it doesn’t have an annual fee.

As you’re deciding whether this card is a fit for you please use this review in conjunction with Clark Howard’s 7 Rules for Using Credit Cards.

What Is the U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card?

The U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card is a no-annual-fee credit card that allows customers to customize their rewards path. Each quarter cardmembers are presented with a menu of options for picking two 5% cash back categories for the first $2000 in purchases and 2% cash back on one everyday category. All other purchases earn 1% cash back.

The card is similar to popular rotating cash back cards like the Discover it and Chase Freedom Flex®.

U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card: Specs and Perks

Let’s take a look at the fine print to examine some of the card’s perks and drawbacks.

Cash Back Rewards

This rewards program is built on consumer choice so the path to earning optimal cash back will be different for each cardholder.

Advertisement

Here’s how it works:

5% Cash Back: Each quarter you are able to select two spending categories. These can be things like internet streaming department stores and home utilities. The combined spending on the two categories you choose is capped at the first $2000 in purchases for the 5% reward. After that you’ll earn 1% on spending in those categories. 2% Cash Back: In addition to your 5% categories U.S. Bank also will give you 2% cash back on one everyday category. The options for this will be different from the 5% options and include gas stations/EV charging stations grocery stores and restaurants. There is no spending limit at this reward level. 1% Cash Back: All purchases made outside of the three categories you’ve selected for that particular quarter will qualify for a base 1% cash back reward.

Here’s a look at a “sample menu” of cash back category choices for a single quarter:

USBank.com

It’s important to remember that these bonus categories can change from quarter to quarter and that you must opt in each quarter to select your bonus categories. If you don’t all purchases will earn 1% cash back.

Cash Back Redemption

Here are a few things you’ll want to note about this card’s redemption protocols:

You can redeem your cash back rewards as one of the following: a statement credit a deposit made to a U.S. Bank savings checking or money market account or a U.S. Bank Rewards Card.

Redemptions can be made at any time but the minimum cash back redemption to get a U.S. Bank Rewards Card is $20.

Rewards expire 36 months after the billing cycle in which they are accumulated.

You will immediately lose unused cash back rewards if your account is closed.

Other Cardholder Benefits

Welcome Bonus: This card carries an easy-to-achieve $200 welcome bonus that requires only $1000 in spending during the first 120 days of card membership.

This card carries an easy-to-achieve $200 welcome bonus that requires only $1000 in spending during the first 120 days of card membership. Introductory APR Period: The U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card offers 0% for 15 months on new purchases and balance transfers. Afterward the variable APR will be 18.99% – 28.99% based on creditworthiness.



Cardholder Fees

Here’s a quick look at some of the fees you may encounter with the U.S. Bank Cash+ Card:

Annual Fee: None.

None. Balance Transfer Fee: 3% of the amount of each transfer or $5 minimum whichever is greater

Cash Advance Fee: 4% of the amount of each advance with a $10 minimum.

4% of the amount of each advance with a $10 minimum. Foreign Transaction Fee: 2% of the transaction if completed in U.S. dollars 3% if completed in foreign currency.

2% of the transaction if completed in U.S. dollars 3% if completed in foreign currency. Late Payment Fee: Up to $40.

U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card vs. Rotating 5% Cash Back Cards

If you are considering the U.S. Bank Cash+ card for its quarterly 5% cash back categories it stands to reason that you also may be considering one of the rotating 5% cash back cards.

The most popular of those are the Discover it Cash Back and the Chase Freedom Flex.

These cards differ from the U.S. Bank card in that they don’t let you pick categories for the 5% bonus. Instead they release a calendar many months in advance that lays out exactly what the bonus categories will be each quarter for the next calendar year.

But for a card to qualify as one you want to own you should consider more than just the cash back rewards schedule. There are other factors.

Let’s take a look at them with this side-by-side comparison:

Advertisement

Card Characteristic U.S. Bank Cash+ Discover it Cash Back Chase Freedom Flex Annual Fee None None None Welcome Bonus $200 on $1000 spending ""Cash Back Match"" for all Year 1 spending $200 on $500 spending Intro APR Offer for New Purchases None Yes Yes Intro APR Offer for Balance Transfers Yes None None 5% Categories You choose 2 from a list each quarter Scheduled quarterly in advance Scheduled quarterly in advance Spending Cap on 5% Categories $2000 per quarter $1500 per quarter up to $500 per billing cycle Additional Bonus Categories 2% on one everyday category per quarter None 3% on restaurants and drug stores Standard Cash Back Rate 1% 1% 1% Cell Phone Protection No No Yes $800 per claim Foreign Transaction Fee 2-3% (based on currency used) None 3%

The Big Takeaways

Here are some things to consider coming out of that comparison:

As you may have noticed in addition to allowing you to choose the 5% categories the U.S. Bank Cash+ card also has a $2000 spending cap while the other two limit it to $1500. If you spend to the maximum in the 5% category each quarter that difference could net you an additional $100 in cash back rewards each year.

The Chase Freedom Flex doesn’t have the flashy Year 1 match nor the ability to choose your categories but it does have the best non-5% cash back program. At 3% cash back on restaurant and drugstore spending as well as 5% on select travel purchased through Chase you could definitely use this card for more than just a 5% category spender.

If cell phone protection is important to you note that Chase is the only one of the three to offer it.

If you travel a lot it may be important to you that the Discover card is the only one of the three that doesn’t charge foreign transaction fees.

Final Thoughts

Are you considering adding the U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card to your wallet? Let’s review some of the major pros and cons of the card before you make your final decision:

Pros Cons Choice of two 5% cash back spending categories each quarter You must opt in to get your cash back bonuses each quarter or you’ll get only 1% on all transactions Easy-to-achieve $200 welcome bonus Bonus categories can change from quarter to quarter limiting the predictability of rewards Introductory APR period on balance transfers Only 1% cash back on everyday purchases

Bottom Line: If you’re the kind of person who likes to carry several cash back credit cards to maximize your rewards the Cash+ card could be an option for you.

The Federal Reserve's latest interest rate increase did little to change Bank of America's recession outlook.

Analysts wrote in a Thursday note viewed by Insider that the central bank's 50-basis-point hike ""provides little relief"" to their 2023 economic outlook.

""Following the Fed's recent 50bps rate hike our BofA economists remain cautious on the US economy and continue to expect a mild recession starting in 1Q23 with negative US GDP for 2023"" the note said.

While BofA posits stocks have a material downside of 36% next year analysts highlighted three market areas still worth considering.

""Our BofA strategists prefer quality income and small caps to growth stocks going into 2023"" the note said. Analysts also added that this outlook remains ""cautious for our Internet coverage group"" which includes companies like Amazon Alphabet Meta EBay and Expedia.

BofA specifically highlighted Meta and Google-parent Alphabet as best poised to navigate a potential recession successfully. And despite deep cuts to advertising revenue remaining a threat to both companies in a recession BofA says they still ""have potential investment spending and bonus accrual flexibility that could enable the companies to grow earnings in a mild to moderate recession scenario with flat to down revenues.""

Both companies did not perform well during the 2008 Great Financial Crisis but present economic headwinds are driven by inflation as opposed to a fundamental break in markets that investors saw in the last major recession.

And despite Meta laying off a record number of employees in 2022 the company's commitment to the metaverse and artificial intelligence investments remain positive points for the company's future the note added."

In his 1995 essay “The Militia in Me” Denis Johnson describes meeting two men campaigning for the 1992 presidential candidate Bo Gritz a far-right former Special Forces officer. “Both men believed that somebody had shanghaied the United States that pirates had seized the helm of the ship of state and now steered it toward some completely foreign berth where it could be plundered at leisure.”

This fall I set out to meet today’s version of such alienated activists who were looking for solace in a civilian defense group. On a street corner in West Covina just outside Los Angeles one of them Vincent Tsai told me: “We need to be armed and ready. We need to be our own self-defense.” After being suspended from the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department for refusing to comply with mask and vaccine mandates he was running for State Senate in November’s elections. (He didn’t win.)

In Friday-afternoon traffic wearing yellow shorts he stood with his 7-year-old son at the intersection of two congested thoroughfares handing out flyers. His wife Gigi who teaches a free weekly exercise class called Patriot Pilates was with him collecting signatures on a clipboard for his campaign.

Tsai told me that the globalists and the Chinese Communist Party were taking over the U.S. and he lamented the erosion of American masculinity and fighting spirit. “If our Founding Fathers were like these soy boys nowadays we wouldn’t have America” he said. Tsai suspicious of the government yet hopeful it could be reformed offered to protect me if that ever became necessary. In the meantime he suggested that I train in jiu-jitsu and learn to grow my own food.

Tsai is one of nearly a thousand California members of People’s Rights a civilian defense group established by the anti-government activist Ammon Bundy in rural Idaho. Known for his involvement in armed standoffs with federal officers at his father’s Nevada ranch in 2014 and the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016 Bundy created People’s Rights in early 2020. He called it neighborhood watch on steroids—a group that will mobilize to respond to a range of threats “from your business being looted downtown to [Child Protective Services] trying to take your child.” The arrival of the pandemic was a catalyst for the growth of People’s Rights which found a large receptive constituency in those who saw their liberty threatened by public-health mandates they deemed unconstitutional.

Read: Modern America’s most successful secessionist movement

At its first meeting in a warehouse in the town of Emmett Idaho some 60 people gathered to plan an Easter service in defiance of the local government’s COVID-19 restrictions. During the coronavirus pandemic Bundy was arrested for trespassing when he and several followers protested inside a hospital in Idaho. In Montana a member offered a $100 bounty for the address of Kalispell’s mayor so he could make a citizen’s arrest on grounds that the municipality’s shelter-in-place order was unconstitutional. These confrontations were not violent per se; the hostility was more on an emotional and performative plane—as when an anti-government activist stood outside a health commissioner’s house for several days with a turkey on a leash filming the official as he came and went. In the Klamath Basin in southern Oregon a People’s Rights branch gathered to support some farmers who planned to break into federal property to release water for their ranches and farms.

Several members active in the group however have instigated violence. Sean Anderson an area assistant for People’s Rights in Idaho who was one of the last holdouts at the Malheur occupation exchanged fire with police officers after a pursuit for a traffic violation. When Anderson who is also a member of the Three Percenters anti-government militia was convicted of felony aggravated assault People’s Rights held a rally in support of him. But the purposely decentralized nature of People’s Rights enables Bundy and the group to avoid being held responsible for this type of action.

“The pandemic was a wonderful time for extreme patriot groups and People’s Rights fit very easily into that patriot militia setting” Travis McAdam an official of the Montana Human Rights Network told me. “You have people who were scared looking for answers angry at the government and people like Ammon look around and see a target-rich environment to co-opt and direct that anger in the ways they want to.”

I’d wanted to meet Tsai because I’d heard People’s Rights described as “the Uber of militias”—summon them via app if you feel that your rights are under attack—and I wondered how this plays out in Southern California a part of the country one might not immediately associate with anti-government militias. “You get a text on the Bat Phone and they’ll come to your defense” Tsai told me. The local chapter meeting of People’s Rights was 10 minutes from my apartment on the east side of Los Angeles; it was led by a Hollywood voice-over actor and a crane operator from a beachside town. By this fall the group had a presence in every state and claimed to have a national membership of more than 50000.

David French: There is no MAGA movement without threats and violence

When I went to a series of weekly People’s Rights meetings I was struck by the dissonance of how innocuous an organization labeled as an extremist group can appear. It was mired in the same sort of procedural tedium that accompanies any meeting of political activists. At my first meeting a petition to recall a judge was going around; a man who signed it told me he worked for the city’s Department of Water and Power.

In particular it was difficult to square a measured and sober-seeming activist and candidate for office like Tsai with a human-rights group’s report on People’s Rights that described it as “a dangerous new network of militia members anti-maskers conspiracists preppers and anti-vaxxers.” Tsai hosted firearm trainings for members of the group so that they could learn self-defense. “Forming a militia like a nationwide militia and then taking over by force sounds great on paper” he told me. “But most people don’t understand the reality of war … Bloodshed should always be the last resort.”

So how to make sense of this Venn diagram of political activism with its apparently overlapping circles of people who simply want to participate in civic life at a grassroots level and those willing to take up arms against government tyranny?

At People’s Rights meetings I met members who passed out pocket Constitutions and studies about the dangers of the Pfizer vaccine and advised me to start learning how to use ham radio. A man in a fedora gave me a leaflet on propaganda and asked me if I’d read Noam Chomsky’s Manufacturing Consent. Another man wearing a People’s Convoy hat showed me photos of a send-off gathering he’d attended for Californians heading to the Canadian truckers protest earlier this year. Later he texted me a link to an infrared-light device that he said healed his knee injury. We met for coffee one afternoon near where we both live and he told me that the fancy new housing developments going up around L.A. will be used for a forced relocation of rural people into cities so the powers that be can have their land.

“We need strong people willing to lose their lives—like our Founding Fathers” a woman in a red tank top told the assembly of about 20 people in a public park just outside Los Angeles on a Sunday afternoon. “Republicans are weak” she went on. “We need to start our own parallel society.” People mingled around a potluck of brownies and tacos; in the foreground kids played pickup soccer and badminton and a woman lay in the grass with her corgi. Attached to a tree was a banner for the group featuring a stock photo of a blond family: Uniting Neighbors to Defend Their Families Faith Freedom and Future. “We have to have our own police force so to speak” the meeting leader said. “People have to defend themselves these days.” A man wearing an ALEX JONES WAS RIGHT T-shirt applauded from his lawn chair.

Kathleen Belew: White power white violence

I got the impression that some members came to meetings just looking for people to talk with—the camaraderie of the group seemed for some their last flimsy connection to society. “If it weren’t for my strong Slavic roots I’d be dead by now” said one attendee describing his depression to anyone who’d chat with him and who each week handed out leaflets about all the people who wanted to ruin his life. What united People’s Rights activists was a sense that society had lost its bearings: Traditional policing was no longer reliable for maintaining freedom and a continuum of government overreach now threatened them—they believed that what had started with mask mandates would end in concentration camps. Because of this they reasoned an armed standoff between citizens and anyone denying their liberty might be necessary.

“COVID created an environment that Ammon took advantage of. The militia idea became appealing to people because it gave them a step to take. A lot of these people just felt desperate and anxious and wanted to feel like they had a mission” Betsy Gaines Quammen a historian and the author of American Zion: Cliven Bundy God and Public Lands in the West told me. “It was a group of people who wanted to feel empowered” she said. “And then there are people in the movement that see engaging in an act of violence as a way of participating—it’s the idea that lawlessness is justified because there’s been an infringement on their rights.”

At one Sunday meeting in the park a semicircle of firefighters in turnout gear were standing near the picnic tables when I arrived and I thought at first that there must have been a medical call or some other minor emergency—but I found out that People’s Rights had invited the Pasadena Fire Department to give a presentation on disaster preparation. “How could a group like ours help you?” one of the leaders asked the firefighters. “How do we contact you guys if the communication systems go down?” A family sitting on a picnic blanket listened in.

I called Tasha Adams the estranged ex-wife of the Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes to ask about the interplay between these regular members and the group’s more extreme fringe. (Rhodes has recently been convicted of seditious-conspiracy charges relating to his part in fomenting the January 6 Capitol riot.) She told me how the Oath Keepers whose membership includes many veterans and former law-enforcement officers had attracted a lot of new less militant members after all the publicity of the Bundy family’s armed standoffs with the FBI.

David A. Graham: It was sedition

“Stewart started purchasing billboards in the D.C. metro and sponsoring NASCAR—totally harmless” Adams said. “That was the level of membership most people wanted; you know regular NRA people who want that level of involvement because they feel lost or whatever. People wanted to feel like they belonged to something had an avenue to use some of the skills that are useless after you get back from the war—you know get the chainsaw out and cut down trees that are falling down suddenly people are thanking them for their service again and they feel good.”

As we talked I thought of Tsai whom I’d seen speaking to the group in the park dressed in his sheriff’s uniform. His speech and his firearms trainings bolstered the group’s morale but Adams’s analysis was darker. “All the while these members are just fueling and giving cover to someone like Stewart who literally is just waiting for that opportunity to become a dictator.” She went on to share her view that “it seems for sure like a pattern where Ammon is doing the same thing.” I reached out to both Bundy and Rhodes through his lawyer for comment on Adams’s remarks; neither responded.

Tsai’s campaign was one of many by People’s Rights activists this fall as the group’s focus turned to electoral politics. Anti-government figures running for office might seem counterintuitive but it’s not a new phenomenon—the Militia of Montana a paramilitary group active in the 1990s said it would fight first at the ballot box then with the cartridge box. In the November midterms Bundy came in third in Idaho’s gubernatorial race winning 100000 votes—17 percent of Idaho’s voters—with QAnon-esque campaign ads and a far-right agenda that included paying liberals to move to California.

I asked McAdam of the Montana Human Rights Network about this seeming contradiction. “They’re saying ‘It’s not that we hate government—it’s that we hate illegitimate governments that are trying to take things away from us’” he told me. “It’s not as sexy as an armed standoff but inspiring people to run for office is an important part of the militia movement: It became a natural progression to say ‘What we need is to have our people take over all these institutions.’”

Across Southern California People’s Rights members were promoting candidates like Tsai. At a campaign event Tsai convened in Pomona Daniel Bocic Martinez a Republican candidate for U.S. Congress told the group about how the pandemic was part of a larger conspiracy “organized by a small group of elites who want as many dead bodies as possible.” Other candidates such as Ryan Maye a full-time plumber running for state assembly mingled with a small crowd. Martinez explained how encouraging people to get electric vehicles was a deadly ruse so that “they” could control people by switching off the grid. “It’s a war against us” he said. (Martinez lost to his Democratic opponent in November.)

“My influence only goes so far: I can ensure the peace I can protect people but I can’t stop the people that are behind this” Tsai said. “To do that I need to be part of that system. I need to be in office.”

David Frum: Only the GOP celebrates political violence

In the 1970s Reverend William Potter Gale created the Posse Comitatus paramilitary group named after a Latin phrase that means “power of the county” referring to a sheriff’s supreme authority to impose law and order. “While the historic role of a posse comitatus had been to aid civil authorities in suppressing violence and vigilantism Bill Gale’s revision stood this ancient practice on its head—his posse was devoted to promoting armed insurrection” Daniel Levitas writes in The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right. After two lethal standoffs in 1992—at Ruby Ridge in Idaho and Waco in Texas—followed by the passage of federal gun legislation in 1993 and 1994 many right-wing citizens’ militias were formed under the auspices of patriotic constitutional vigilantism.

In People’s Rights lawlessness in response to mandates was justified through the idea of the posse comitatus. Many in the group told me that L.A. Sheriff Alex Villanueva—who has since lost a bid for reelection—should have declared himself a constitutional sheriff in order to lock up the board of supervisors. Several People’s Rights members wore T-shirts bearing the name of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officer Association—a group that believes sheriffs should assume supreme authority whenever liberty is being threatened. Former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack who has been tied to extremists and militias for decades now leads the association which promotes resisting state and federal authority on guns mandates and election results.

Tsai was undeterred by his lack of success with voters. “We can never comply our way out of tyranny. It’s always been a small group of warriors that risked everything—their families their lives their property—and fought back against tyranny to create a better country a new world for people to live in” he told me.

Failure at the ballot box didn’t bring him to the cartridge box. He planned to keep going to board-of-supervisors meetings—even though he told me most of the patriots he knows don’t show up. He felt let down by their apathy. “I’m still canvassing door to door and teaching people skills” he said. “People should journal and spend time in nature. Modern society is too weak for an actual insurrection. People are fat lazy untrained and unmotivated.” He invited me to come shooting with him in the desert the next weekend. “The globalist plan is accelerating” he said. “Things are going to be chaos by next year.”

The paranoid certainty of chaos-to-come is retread so frequently in American life that it’s practically one of the country’s myths. In the face of powerlessness this seemed to offer People’s Rights members the reassurance of being the few prepared to understand and defend against what’s next—wishful thinking that gave them a sense of purpose to anticipate the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9kaWFzcG9yYS9hbnRpc2VtaXRpc20vYXJ0aWNsZS03MjUxNTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber driver complains about 'too many Jews' to Jewish passenger,"An Uber driver was recorded complaining about ""too many Jews"" while he had a Jewish passenger in the back seat of his car in New York City over the weekend.

Other antisemitic incidents with Uber

This isn't the first time a Jew has faced antisemitism while riding with Uber.

Back in 2019 an Uber driver in Los Angeles kicked two Jewish women out of his car after he found out they were coming from an Israel Independence Day celebration.

The driver who said he was Palestinian asked the women where they were coming from once they got in his car. They were hesitant to answer but told the driver after he didn't start the car. He then told them to get out of his car.

""He started laughing and he looked us dead in the eye and he said 'You need to get out of my car. I'm Palestinian.'"" one of the women told the Jewish Journal.

In 2018 an Uber driver ordered an Israeli diplomat to leave his car after he answered his phone in Hebrew.

""That was enough for the driver to stop in the Lower Wacker Drive [a major Chicago highway] and start yelling at me 'Get out of my car!'"" Israeli diplomat Itay Milner said. ""It was scary because you saw that he lost it. I saw that he was enraged...He had a look in his eyes that you could see there was a lot of hate.""

After the man yelled at him Milner asked if he was being kicked out because he was speaking Hebrew. The driver then responded with ""Yes.""

""I did feel the danger because I didn't know what this guy was capable of"" Milner said.

(KSLA) - On Wednesday Dec. 14 around 7:41 p.m. Texarkana Arkansas Police Department patrol officers were notified of a robbery at the Ulta Beauty Supply in Texarkana Ark.

Officers were given information about the theft and then came in contact with a white Chevrolet Malibu in the 1700 block of E 47th Street in Texarkana. The car sped away as the officer at the scene approached say officials with Texarkana Arkansas Police Department.

The officer sped after the car which was going about 133 mph. The suspects in the Malibu then began throwing the stolen items out of the window.

According to officials the suspects were finally stopped at the intersection of Tall Oaks and Water Oak streets and all five women in the car were arrested.

The arrested suspects are as follows:

Kyshawn Winston 23

Deja Hunter 22

Kayla Jones 21

Romekia Robinson 21

Marquina Capers 23

5 women suspected of stealing 6k worth of items from Ulta Beauty (Texarkana Ark. Police Department)

They’re all from Shreveport La.

The suspects’ car was searched and a gun was found as well as the items from the Ulta Beauty store. The items were valued at $6000 say Texarkana Arkansas PD.

The arrested suspects were transported and booked into the Miller County Jail where they are awaiting their court appearance.

The total charges between the five suspects consisted of fleeing by vehicle theft by receiving with a value greater than $5000 tampering with evidence obstructing governmental operations and possession of a firearm by certain persons.

Will It Last?,"The mass makeup market is recovering. But the next few months will determine if it is a trend with legs or just a spike driven by replenishment after the pandemic purchasing pause.

After almost two years of decline in dollar makeup sales IRI a Chicago-based research firm clocked gains in almost all cosmetics segments for the 52-week period ended October 30 2022 in mass-market outlets. One of the most notable gains was a 19% uptick in lipstick sales. Facial products produced a 10.2% sales bounce eye was up 6.5% and nail (which was one of the only makeup sectors that produced gains for the same period in 2020 and 2021) rose only 1.1%. Skincare was a category that was not as impacted over the past two years in both mass and class. Mass marketers posted skincare gains of 5.7% for the tracked period. Fragrances remain flat in mass.

Yet to be determined is if the upgrades mass marketers have made in the ambiance and product assortments are enough to siphon shoppers away from prestige competitors. Past economic downturns such as in 2008 pushed shoppers to save by downscaling to mass beauty products. While there has been talk for a year that the US is close to a recession there has been no official declaration leaving many to debate the future.

Although sales are heading in the right direction mass increases lag prestige gains suggesting many shoppers are still clinging to luxury beauty options—even as their pocketbooks are being pinched. Apparently consumers didn’t get the memo that in tough times they are supposed to trade down.

Third-quarter results from The NPD Group revealed more robust gains in prestige than in mass. Prestige beauty sales in the US expanded to $6 billion up 15% versus 2021’s third quarter.

“Unit sales and revenues are both growing by double digits for beauty products sold in the prestige market” said Larissa Jensen Beauty Industry Advisor for The NPD Group. Makeup sales surpassed pre-pandemic 2019 levels according to Jensen. Lip was the fastest-growing segment at 32%. Skincare in prestige rose 14% (almost three times that of mass). Both hair and fragrances performed well in prestige up 23% and 11% respectively.

Digging into the mass numbers to see if gains were accrued by moving more or by selling higher-priced SKUs reveals differences in the category examined. There was a 10% leap in lip units and a 4% uptick in face. Unit sales dropped marginally (down 0.7%) in the eye category. For mass to surpass competitors there needs to be greater unit movement and higher tickets experts said.

The beauty category has long been under the microscope in the mass market. Inventory turns are slow versus other categories (like groceries) and the investment in space is costly to accommodate all the SKUs needed to have meaningful assortments. The category must pay its way.

Target Walmart and CVS in particular have invested in burnishing their departments. Ulta Beauty also just announced plans to overhaul its store layouts which could mean more competition for big-box competitors as mass products will get equal footing with luxury.

There’s been a great deal of buzz about the evolution of beauty at Walmart with some suggesting the nation’s largest chain is supplanting Target as the “cool” discounter. The upgrades started with Jody Pinson and kicked into overdrive with Musab Balbale who totally changed Walmart’s approach to courting brands. Merchants sent direct messages to brands rather than waiting for brands to knock on their doors. One nascent brand told BeautyMatter that Walmart helped her by paying 90 days (versus 120 from other retailers) and keeping her on shelves even with a slow start. At the helm now is Creighton Kiper (who recently accepted the WWD Beauty Inc. award as Mass Retailer of the Year) who brand founders say is maintaining the speed-to-market pace.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXpvZXJlcG9ydC5jb20vYmVhdXR5L2NsZWFyLWJyb3ctZ2Vscy10aGljay1leWVicm93c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Rely On Clear Brow Gels To Fake Thick Eyebrows,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXpvZXJlcG9ydC5jb20vYmVhdXR5L2NsZWFyLWJyb3ctZ2Vscy10aGljay1leWVicm93c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D800D13C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Unifor has remained tight-lipped on the progress of negotiations ahead of the expiration of the five collective agreements December 31.

Unifor claims to be looking for enhancements in wages and benefits and a resolution to the on-going issue of contracting out of unionized work. In its latest bargaining update Unifor asserted that talks are “productive” and “progressing well” but refused to provide details. The update concluded with the arrogant declaration “The union does not bargain publicly” and a stern warning to workers not to “entertain rumours that may come up during the bargaining process.”

The secrecy surrounding the collective bargaining process underscores that it is a charade in which the company and the union hope to conspire to impose a rotten deal without any input from the workers themselves.

As talks got under way in November Unifor National President Lana Payne demagogically stated that Unifor would fight for wage increases to keep pace with rampant inflation commenting “The fact is that during a time of record inflation CN is reporting record quarterly earnings. Without our members at the helm this company wouldn’t have been able to get even close to that and they deserve to be compensated fairly and treated with respect.” Daniel Cloutier Unifor Quebec Director added “While they have been cutting thousands of jobs over the last few years shareholder dividends and executive compensation has nevertheless continued to increase. With high inflation rates CN must put the needs of workers first.”

While union bureaucrats spout resolute sounding language for media releases criticizing management members of Local 100 and Council 4000 know only too well that Unifor and the Teamsters union are thoroughly complicit in overseeing the present miserable working conditions across Canada’s railroads and blocking worker resistance. In 2015 in the face of a threat from the federal government to criminalize a strike by 3300 CP Rail engineers conductors and yardmen the Teamsters union capitulated and agreed to binding arbitration. That same year Unifor answered a threat from CN to lockout 4800 safety inspectors and rail maintenance workers with a last-minute contract settlement that failed to meet workers’ demands. CN Rail management itself was surprised that Unifor accepted a deal despite complaining that negotiations were at an impasse without even raising the possibility of consulting its membership on a strike mandate.

In 2019 a seven-day strike by 3200 CN Rail train conductors operators and yardmen was called off when the Teamsters reached an agreement with the company that met none of the workers needs. At no time during the struggle did the union leadership make any attempt to rally support from CN workers represented by Unifor or railway workers throughout North America.

Three thousand CP Rail conductors and engineers who are members of the Teamsters voted overwhelmingly for strike action in March 2022 to conduct a struggle for an end to gruelling work schedules and wage increases. Unifor ensured that maintenance staff at CP Rail whose contract is now also up for renewal remained separated from their brothers and sisters at the same company helping the Teamsters in isolating the strike and strangling it by agreeing to binding arbitration.

In the summer of this year Unifor saddled 2400 VIA Rail workers represented by the same Unifor locals that are currently bargaining at CN with a collective agreement that left them even farther behind after two years of significant real wage cuts at the passenger rail service. As the COVID-19 pandemic took its toll on the travel industry many workers were laid off. Unionized employees suffered a wage freeze in 2020 and a pathetic 2 percent wage “increase” in 2021. The three-year agreement included wage “increases” of 5.5 percent in 2022 3.5 percent in 2023 and 2.5 percent in 2024 or an average wage “increase” over the life of the contract of 3.83 percent. The deal was finalized when the official inflation rate was 7.6 percent meaning a massive real-terms pay cut for workers.

Martine Rivard VIA Rail’s Chief Employee Experience Officer could hardly contain his enthusiasm for the Via Rail deal saying “I am grateful for the hard work of both negotiating teams and would especially like to thank Unifor’s Chief Negotiator Scott Doherty and recognize the guidance of conciliators who helped bring about this positive outcome for our employees and our passengers.” Rivard was quite right in singling out Doherty for his contribution as the contract is a veritable gift to the company after the wage savings from 2020-21.

CN has more than enough resources to provide all rail workers with wage increases above the rate of inflation and end the brutal conditions of exploitation and overwork that lead to derailments and other accidents on a routine basis. CN is one of the top publicly traded Canadian companies by revenue. Revenue for the twelve months ending September 30 2022 was $12.8 billion a 12.2 percent increase year-over-year. And revenue for the quarter ending the same date was $3.5 billion a 21.2 percent year-over-year.

In 2020 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic CN’s revenue suffered a decline of 8.2 percent from 2019 numbers reducing annual revenue to “only” $10.3 billion. On this basis the highly profitable corporation qualified for the federal Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) program a slush fund for corporate bonuses and shareholder payouts that was supposedly designed to pay 70 percent of workers’ wages at businesses impacted by pandemic-related restrictions.

Due to the ruthless conditions of exploitation for rail workers the railways are one of the most lucrative industries across North America attracting speculative investment from hedge funds major banks and some of the world’s wealthiest capitalists. Billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is a major shareholder in CN Rail and held a significant share of CP Rail. In the United States BNSF is controlled by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Union Pacific’s major shareholders include The Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc.

The source of the profits generated by the industry has been a relentless decades-long attack on the wages and working conditions of railway workers which has included the active acquiescence of the various trade unions that claim to represent their interests. For train crews the Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) system demands almost total on-call availability 24 hours a day year-round. This system reduces workers to mere adjuncts of the company because they are the sole creators of profit for these predatory corporations. Likewise the pressure on administration support staff and the trades must necessarily increase to meet the demands for continuously increasing profit.

To appeal under these conditions as Unifor does for CN Rail’s management to “put workers first” is absurd. These ruthless hirelings of the financial oligarchy serve the class interests of the ruling elite which depends upon maintaining the brutal work regimen to secure corporate profits and shareholder payouts. The only way to stop this is through a unified struggle by all rail workers at CN CP and their American class I counterparts.

As rail workers in the United States have learned over recent months the development of such a fight is not merely a question of trade union militancy but a political struggle. Despite voting for strike action and repeatedly rejecting bogus contracts that met none of their demands US rail workers were prohibited from striking by the Biden administration the trade unions and the pseudo-left which connived to impose sellout agreements through the intervention of Congress to ban strike action.

Unifor is actively working to prevent the emergence of a unified struggle of rail workers in Canada no less fervently than the rail unions in the US. On September 14 Unifor Local 101R began negotiations on a collective agreement with Canadian Pacific (CP) for 1200 maintenance workers. The main issues for CP Rail workers are the company’s heavy-handed discipline grievance backlog and years of wage restraint. If it wished to and planned accordingly Unifor could simultaneously have the Canadian railway duopoly of CN and CP in an extremely vulnerable position. It would give workers the ability to demand serious concessions from a critical sector of the capitalist economy.

But the Unifor leadership is organically hostile to such a prospect which is why it is working assiduously to keep the two disputes separate. Even though CP Rail made a provocative wage offer that did not even come close to the rate of inflation the union waited months before filing a “notice of dispute” which triggers a 60-day “conciliation” process overseen by a federal mediator. This period is followed by a 21-day “cooling-off” period. Either party is then obligated to provide 72 hours’ notice of intention to initiate a lockout or strike. The end result of these bureaucratic hurdles designed to smother workers’ resistance is that Unifor officials will only start discussing wage issues with CP in the second week of January which they hope will give them enough time to sell out the CN workers before the struggle at CP comes to a head.

The only answer for railway workers is to organize independently of the corporatist trade union bureaucracies by forming rank-and-file committees which can coordinate their actions to truly advance the interests of the working class.

Earlier this year workers at CP Rail formed the CP Workers Rank-and-File Committee to fight for their interests in the face of the ruthless practices of corporate management and the utter subservience of the unions to corporate interests. Railroaders across crafts and employers in the US formed the Railroad Workers Rank-and-File Committee to coordinate the broad opposition to abysmal working conditions and the contracts which were imposed on them.

Workers at Canadian National Railway must do the same and in fact go beyond that to link their struggles with those of their brothers and sisters across Canada and the 120000 rail workers in the United States who have been engaged in a three-year fight with the unions the rail companies and the federal government.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Mesa Airlines said late Saturday it is finalizing an agreement to operate regional flights for United Airlines after an announcement it will wind down flights for American Airlines early next year.

In a memo sent to employees and provided to Reuters by the company Mesa Air Group Chief Executive Jonathan Ornstein said the Arizona-based carrier is ""finalizing a new agreement with United which would transition all CRJ900s currently flying for American Eagle to United Express."" The CRJ900 is a regional jet made by Canada's Bombardier Inc that has around 75 seats.

American Eagle is a network of six regional carriers operating 3400 daily flights under a codeshare with American – often flights to smaller regional cities. Three of the six are American Airlines subsidiaries and three are contract carriers including Mesa.

A United spokeswoman declined to comment.

American declined to comment on Ornstein's memo. The airline said earlier on Saturday that Mesa would halt service for the airline on April 3 after significant reductions in March.

American said in a memo made available to Reuters by the company that flights operated by Mesa will be backfilled by other regional carriers adding ""Air Wisconsin is preparing to join the American Eagle family earlier than planned.""

Mesa said the switch was prompted by a regional pilot shortage and American's actions related to that.

Ornstein said American ""significantly raised regional pilot wages for their wholly owned subsidiaries to deter pilots from going to national carriers and attract pilots from the ever-shrinking pool of qualified pilot applicants.""

But Ornstein added in the Mesa memo ""American chose not to fund the higher pilot rates for their non-affiliated carriers. At the same time we were being penalized for not producing the required block hours under our pre-COVID contract with American. These two actions were costing us approximately $5 million in losses per month.""

Story continues

Ornstein said ""As a result we have concerns about American's ability to be a reliable partner going forward ... We just do not believe it is in Mesa's long term interest to fund ongoing losses at American.""

The latter cast the decision differently in its memo saying Mesa ""has experienced various financial and operational difficulties this year. As a result we have concerns about Mesa's ability to be a reliable partner for American going forward.""

Mesa's Ornstein said under the anticipated new agreement ""United would maintain all existing domiciles and maintenance bases currently operated for American and plans to add Denver as a domicile and Houston as a CRJ domicile.""

Ornstein noted that United announced a huge Boeing order Tuesday - 100 787 Dreamliners and 100 737 MAX airplanes.

""United's growth plan provides extensive advancement opportunities for our people"" Ornstein wrote. ""This deeper relationship will position us to be the preferred carrier for future regional flying opportunities with United.""

A fallout between American Airlines and its regional partner Mesa Airlines has ended in a climax: American has terminated the contract with Mesa and will stop using its services from April. At the same time Mesa is about to confirm a new long-term agreement with United Airlines. The spat has everything to do with pilot shortages at regional carriers.

Both American and Mesa notified their employees on Saturday about the situation but offered different explanations. American has concerns about the financial and operational stability of Mesa Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr said in a note to staff that was seen by CNBC. Mesa blames American for causing problems but CEO Jonathan Ornstein advised staff to forget about the rumors and things that have been written.

According to Ornstein’s note to staff Mesa is losing $5 million per month on its services for American Eagle as its schedule is getting disrupted by two factors. It is losing pilots to rival airlines because American is refusing to pay wages for pilots at non-affiliated airlines like Mesa while increasing them for wholly-owned subsidiaries. Mesa itself also raised wages for its own pilots. “At the same time we are being penalized for not producing the required block hours under our pre-Covid contract with American” says Ornstein.

The accumulating monthly losses on the American Eagle operations have raised concerns at Mesa about “American’s ability to be a reliable partner going forward. (…) We just don’t believe it is in Mesa’s long-term interest to fund ongoing losses at American” said Ornstein. Kerr said that American and Mesa agreed that winding down its agreement would be the best for both.

At that point Mesa approached United and start discussions “in earnest”. This has resulted in an agreement that sees Mesa shift all its 40 Bombardier/Mitsubishi CRJ900s from American Eagle to United Express’s regional services. It now flies 60 Embraer E175s for United Express while 20 CRJ700s were parked in 2021. During Q3 47 percent of Mesa’s revenues of $134.4 million was derived from American Eagle 46 from United Express two percent from DHL Express and five percent from others.

The new agreement with United “will prove to be one of the most advantageous transactions in the history of regional aviation” said Ornstein in his note to staff. United will maintain all domiciles and engineering bases that are currently in use by American “and plans to add Denver as a domicile and Houston as a CRJ domicile.” This will secure jobs for Mesa staff.

Mesa was supposed to announce its Q4 (September quarter) and full-year results last week but asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for extra time until December 29. The carrier reported a $-7.5 million net loss in FY21. The Q3 FY22 loss was $-10 million caused by “industry-wide elevated pilot attrition and the significant reduction in the commercial pilot pipeline exacerbated by the 1500-hour rule” as the reasons for its loss.

Ornstein said in August that “we intend to take dramatic action to address the pilot shortage through increased recruiting additional simulator capacity and expansion of our pilot pipeline. We are also pleased that United Airlines has expanded the Aviate program to include all of our pilots.” Already in June Mesa said it had an enhanced agreement about the United Aviate pilot training scheme which allows Mesa pilots to earn service credit and include prior service to qualify for United’s flying scheme with regional airlines.

To make sure that new pilots accumulate the 1.500 flying hours as quickly as possible that are required for an Airline Transport Pilot license Mesa said announced in September that it will purchase 29 Pipistrel Alpha Trainer 2 aircraft with 75 on option. The first aircraft have been in service since October in Florida and offer young aviators up to forty training hours a week for which Mesa will sponsor the required $25 per hour.

In August Air Wisconsin Airlines announced that it would shift capacity from United to American as part of a new five-year agreement.

UPS,United Parcel Service,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pZi10ZWFtc3RlcnMtdW5pb24tc3RyaWtlcy13aWxsLXVwcy1jbG9zZS1pdHMtZG9vcnPSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVpZ2h0d2F2ZXMuY29tL25ld3MvaWYtdGVhbXN0ZXJzLXVuaW9uLXN0cmlrZXMtd2lsbC11cHMtY2xvc2UtaXRzLWRvb3JzL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If the Teamsters union strikes will UPS close its doors?,"In August 1997 the Teamsters walked off the job across UPS Inc.’s nationwide ground system. With an all-Teamsters labor force and no plans to call in replacement workers to deliver goods UPS shuttered its massive ground network rather than risk permanently damaging its reputation with customers.

The strike lasted 15 days sending an avalanche of parcel and letter volumes to rival carriers burying their networks and in many cases causing significant service disruptions.

A quarter of a century later deja vu is rearing its head.

Under the leadership of General President Sean O’Brien and General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman two hardliners with histories of crossing swords with UPS (NYSE: UPS) the Teamsters have vowed to take 350000 workers out on strike if a new contract isn’t agreed to by Aug. 1 the day after the current five-year pact expires. Given the militancy of both leaders and the perception that organized labor has more leverage in Congress the White House and the court of public opinion than at any time in the past 40 years no one takes the threat lightly.

In 1997 UPS didn’t have robust contingencies in place to manage such a vast and complex network without its drivers loaders and other union personnel. It also underestimated the resolve of then-Teamster boss Ron Carey to pull his members off the job even if it meant rejecting UPS’ best and final offer much to the company’s shock.

Things are different this time around. UPS has informed its managers not to schedule any paid time off during July and August in case parcels are required to be moved according to multiple sources familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. UPS did not respond to a request for comment.





The move sends a clear signal that UPS under CEO Carol B. Tomé plans to continue operating even if the union goes on strike.

Tomé’s apparent determination to keep the company running is likely rooted in the realities of the 2023 marketplace and how much it differs from that of the late 1990s when UPS ruled the U.S. ground parcel business. Mainly UPS needs to keep operating because in a far more competitive environment it can ill afford to deal with a strike and assume shippers will return when it ends.

In 1997 UPS controlled more than 80% of the U.S. ground parcel market according to estimates from consultancy ShipMatrix. Its two main competitors in the business-to-business segment — how most parcel traffic moved — were Airborne Express with limited services compared to UPS and Roadway Package System Inc. (RPS) a small but fast-growing company. FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) had no dedicated ground delivery network. The U.S. Postal Service focused on the business-to-consumer market which was a fraction of what it is today because e-commerce didn’t exist.

At the time UPS felt it could absorb a walkout — and the dislocations accompanying it — without much fallout. It reasoned customers would return because their alternatives were limited. Some post-strike business never returned to UPS – however much of it did.

Many shippers didn’t think a strike would occur and failed to develop contingency plans far enough in advance. Enterprise shippers quite dependent on UPS moved some volumes elsewhere but many chose to wait it out. They eventually went back.

Today UPS controls about 50% of the total market still a healthy share but not what it once was. The reason is clear: more and better competition.

Not long after the strike ended in 1997 FedEx acquired RPS. FedEx has since become a major force in ground parcel delivery. Regional delivery companies have expanded their geographies and offer a better value proposition than ever before. Retailers are building out delivery networks to take more control of their own traffic. The U.S. parcel market is now skewed toward the B2C segment due to the explosive growth of e-commerce delivery. B2C has far more competition than the B2B space.

The U.S. Postal Service under the guise of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is aggressively courting parcel traffic and building what it believes to be a strong alternative. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) while not directly competing with UPS continues to pursue fulfillment and delivery business it can take in-house. Some of those Amazon customers could have come from UPS.

Ironically Amazon UPS’ largest individual customer that accounts for about 11% of its $102 billion in annual revenue stands to encounter the most severe stress if UPS’ network goes offline.

Keep it running

For millions of UPS shippers maintaining operational continuity would be good news. But a scenario of UPS working through a Teamsters strike is so unprecedented it would be considered unimaginable.

At the same time parcel consultants caution that shippers shouldn’t consider an agreement before July 31 — though considered likely because both sides have much to lose in a slowing economy with flattening delivery volumes — to be a slam dunk.

Parcel consultants are urging shippers to seriously engage other carriers soon after peak season and no later than the end of the first quarter. Each day in the U.S. alone UPS delivers nearly 23 million packages volumes that could easily swamp the country’s delivery infrastructure if its system is shut down. No carrier other than the Postal Service because of its mandate to serve every U.S. address is obligated to take any of it.

Other carriers are unlikely to accept more than 10% over the normal daily volume from existing customers and will probably not take on any after a specific date according to a source.

For their part regional carriers have no interest in serving as a safety valve for potentially displaced UPS customers. Two regional carriers plan to announce they will not accept volumes from customers that plan to return to UPS if a strike is averted a source said.

Regional carriers and parcel consolidators — companies that aggregate large volumes from multiple merchants and typically induct them into the Postal Service’s network for last-mile delivery — will “want to be long-term partners under a service contract or they’ll decline participation in bids” a source said. UPS has a similar parcel aggregation service with the Postal Service known as SurePost. Year to date SurePost volumes account for more than 27% of UPS’ ground volumes according to consultancy Shipware LLC.

One tailwind for shippers heading into the first half of 2023 is that delivery capacity is well supplied so carriers will not only have space to accommodate diverted business but may be willing to cut some deals as well.

Nate Skiver founder and president of LPF Spend Management LLC said most UPS customers will not alter their current delivery programs regardless of the potential strike risk. Over the decades UPS has made itself sticky to most of its shippers through its renowned physical distribution and I.T. capabilities. Shippers that use multiple carriers but tender most of their volumes to UPS may choose to hedge their bets Skiver said. “But I don’t see shippers fleeing UPS altogether” he said.

One wild card is FedEx Ground FedEx’s ground delivery unit. Since midyear the unit has dealt with concerns raised by many of its 6000 independent delivery contractors over the impact of surging cost inflation on their businesses. It has apparently managed through the crisis however. The question now is how aggressive FedEx Ground will be in pursuing UPS shippers.

How to prevent theft on your doorstep,"Andresr | E+ | Getty Images

You may not be the only person eager for packages to arrive at your house. During the holidays as the volume of home deliveries surges due to gift buying and giving so does the chance that so-called porch pirates will grab parcels right off your front step experts say. Over the last year an estimated 260 million delivered packages were stolen according to a report from SafeWise an online guide to security and safety products. A year ago the estimate was 210 million. More from Personal Finance:

63% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck

Used car prices are down 3.3% from a year ago

The 10 best metro areas for first-time home buyers ""Package thefts unfortunately are on the rise perhaps in part because of the increase in online shopping that started with the pandemic in 2020"" said Teresa Murray a consumer watchdog for U.S. PIRG a nonprofit consumer advocacy research group.

Online sales remain elevated since 2020

Indeed in the second quarter of 2020 just as the pandemic took hold in the U.S. online sales jumped to 16.4% of all retail sales up from 11.9% in the previous quarter according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. While the share is down to 14.8% as of the third quarter of this year it remains higher than pre-pandemic. Add in the expected holiday shipping frenzy that hits every December and there could be more packages disappearing this month than ever. The total annual lost to this type of theft is an estimated $19.5 billion according to SafeWise.

""Anecdotally police and sheriff's departments in communities across the country have reported that porch pirates have been a huge problem the last several weeks"" Murray said. ""This could be in part because many folks have returned to offices at least part time this year compared with the last two years"" she said. ""And since everyone knows there's an avalanche of deliveries this time of year there's every reason to believe the bad guys use this as an opportunity.""

It's a 'very low risk and very low skill' crime

On top of there being more opportunities it's a fairly easy crime to commit said Ben Stickle a criminal justice professor at Middle Tennessee State University who studies package theft. ""The other aspect of this crime that makes it unique and likely to continue increasing is that there's very low risk and very low skill involved"" Stickle said. ""It takes no skill to walk up and steal a package.""

How to guard against package theft

There are ways to guard against porch pirates. While security cameras can help they aren't always a deterrent — which means it's worth taking other steps as well to ensure the safe arrival of your parcels. If possible you should sign up to receive an email or text message when your package is supposed to arrive and when it's actually delivered Murray said. Each of the major delivery services — the U.S. Postal Service UPS and FedEx — lets you sign up for the notifications. If you're ordering on Amazon the notifications are generally automatic.

However this also means you need to keep an eye on your email and texts. ""Checking your email once a day or whatever doesn't cut it"" Murray said. Once you receive the delivery alert fetch the package immediately or call a neighbor who's home to retrieve it. ""You don't want packages sitting outside for hours whether day or night"" she said. You also could try scheduling the delivery for a day and time you know you'll be home Stickle said. ""Or get it delivered it to an alternative address like work or a trusted neighbor"" he said.

Alternatively you can pick up your package from say a UPS or FedEx store or an Amazon Hub Locker instead of having it delivered. Sometimes you can make the choice after your package has shipped Murray said. ""In other cases you need to select this option when you make the purchase or before it's shipped"" she said.

In fact the automaker has already started delivering its much-hyped Semi electric trucks to the food and beverage company. With orders placed back in 2017 PepsiCo is also the first customer of this gigantic electric truck using them as a way to cut its environmental impact. The company claims to have installed four 750 kW Tesla charging stalls at its plants in California to juice up the big electric trucks.

PepsiCo plans to deploy 15 trucks from Modesto and 21 from the Sacramento plant. Speaking about its Tesla Semi fleet PepsiCo Vice President Mike O'Connell said that it is a great starting point to electrify the company's vehicle fleet. ""Like any early technology the incentives help us build out the program"" he said adding that there were lots of development and infrastructure costs involved with the purchase. Among other companies courier service provider United Parcel Service and food delivery company Sysco Corp have also reserved the Tesla Semi trucks while retailer Walmart is claimed to be testing alternatives.

Tesla Semi has been one of the most anticipated electric trucks of all time. Since its unveiling for the first time in the last decade the Tesla Semi production plan has faced several bumps for years. Tesla CEO Elon Musk first said that the trucks would enter production in 2019 which was delayed due to battery constraints. Consecutively as well the company delayed the project multiple times. This has earned the EV manufacturer accusation of overpromising and under-delivering. However after a lot of delays the EV company has been finally able to start production of the big truck a few months back.

The Tesla Semi offers a whopping 805 km range on a single charge. There is another version in the plan that will offer a 480 km range on a single charge. However the shorter-range version of the Tesla Semi truck is yet to enter production.

Auckland's SPCA in Mangere claims every year the centre is reaching breaking-point to be able to catch up with the backlog of cats to be fostered.

Despite the charity's efforts to find homes for more than 400 animals this summer just at the Mangere centre most of the rental market still says no to pets in their properties.

SPCA's support services manager Laura Millar said every year the situation got worse.

""We seem to be following a trend of each summer getting a little bit more hectic and seeing a lot more animals that need our care.""

Cats bred throughout warm months and the country was experiencing longer and longer summers she said.

""That means an extended breeding period for these animals and more cats and kittens in the community that need our help.""

Millar said with the increased number of animals each year SPCA was constantly looking for volunteers and foster homes.

She said the high cost-of-living was one of the factors helping the rise on the number of animals.

""We are seeing a lot more people who are struggling now to make ends meet and that is a contributing factor for people to not have their animals desexed.""

She said one of biggest challenges people face when applying to foster or adopt recue animals is still the prohibition of pets in many rental properties.

The SPCA always encouraged landlords to accept animals when it was possible Millar said.

""It's quite an issue for a number of people who have pets to find a suitable house. They are either in a position to have a house or a pet.""

SPCA science officer Dr Alison Vaughan said lack of affordable pet-friendly rental properties was a known barrier to adoption.

""A recent New Zealand survey by Companion Animals New Zealand found that 59 percent of people who do not have companion animals would like to get one.

""Thirty-three percent of this group said the main barriers to have companion animals is the landlord or property where people live not allowing it.""

Vaughan said landlords interested in dipping their toe in the waters could also consider allowing tenants to foster animals.

This could be an excellent low-commitment approach to trial allowing a property to be pet-friendly she said.

""SPCA is concerned that current restrictions contribute to the number of pets relinquished to shelters in New Zealand.""

President of Renters United Geordie Roggers said landlords did not consider the possibility of modifying rental contracts to include the benefit of having a pet.

""When it comes to finding insurance for the property it does makes it slightly more expensive for them.""

In that case they tossed up the decision between taking on little bit of extra cost or passing it on to the renter and stopping someone from being able to have a pet.

Landlords might own the property but renters own the home Roggers said.

""It's a sad reality really. Landlords are choosing profit or costs of someone else's ability to enjoy living in their home and have a pet to support them in that.""

Blame the lawmakers not the landlords

The New Zealand Property Investor Federation - NZPIF - is the umbrella body for 17 local Property Investors' Associations throughout New Zealand.

Through a statement its vice-president Peter Lewis said the legislation in New Zealand made it risky for landlords to allow pets.

""The Tenancy Tribunal has ruled that if a landlord knowingly rents a property to a pet-owner they must then expect a consequential increase in damage to the property and that the repair cost of that damage therefore falls on the landlord not the tenant.""

There was also the risk of annoying neighbours Lewis said when pets were kept thus creating more negative feedback for the property owner.

Unfortunately the Residential Tenancy Act prohibited the landlord from asking for any commensurate increase in the security to offset that risk he said.

Lewis said asking for any type of bond to cover having a pet in a rental home was illegal.

The maximum Tenancy Bond that can be requested by the landlord was equivalent to four weeks rent he said.

""Most landlords will specify that four weeks bond as a matter of course therefore any further bond even if classed as a pet bond is illegal.""

Lewis said the NZPIF has prepared a long-term tenancy proposal called Fixing the Rental Crisis that would allow much more freedom to allow pets in rentals.

""This proposal has been distributed to lawmakers and politicians but has yet to be adopted.""",,,

Medicare Advantage is the private-sector alternative to the federal program covering those 65 and over and the disabled. By next year more than half of Medicare recipients are expected to be enrolled in private plans. These policies are often less expensive than traditional Medicare and sometimes offer attractive additional benefits like dental care.

Despite their popularity the plans have been the subject of considerable scrutiny and criticism lately. A recent report by the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that several plans might be inappropriately denying care to patients. And nearly every large insurance company in the program including UnitedHealth Group Elevance Health Kaiser Permanente and Cigna has been sued by the Justice Department for fraudulently overcharging the government.

The period leading up to this year’s enrollment deadline Dec. 7 amplified widespread criticism about the deceptive tactics some brokers and insurers had used to entice people to switch plans.

It’s very large and creaky. There are a wide variety of pungent smells. And sometimes it takes a slight turn in one direction or another so that – like a ship – some time may pass before we notice we are moving in a new direction.

Over the coming weeks consultant doctors will carefully consider a new public-only contract offered by the HSE. The contract which could be worth up to €300000 a year restricts consultants from seeing private patients in public hospitals as is currently the norm. The response will be mixed. Some doctors will find it attractive. Others will regard it as an unacceptable disruption of the longstanding public-private dynamic in Irish hospitals. And most doctors will simply get on with things and enjoy the ocean views.

But the introduction of the contracts represents a critical period of transition in the unique context of the Irish health system. This context bears reflection. Ireland does not have universal healthcare. In this regard we are an outlier among our peers – that is almost every country in Europe along with Australia New Zealand Canada and indeed most of the countries to which our doctors and nurses emigrate.

In plain English a universal health system is one in which all people are guaranteed the right to timely high-quality healthcare when they need it. On a deeper level universal healthcare is based on a conception of healthcare not as an economic good or an item of charity but as a basic and equal right of all people.

Upholding human rights is the essential role of government. Universal systems therefore require significant state involvement. Some societies achieve this through tax; others through universal insurance. But in all cases universalism is a basic premise.

By design we do not have such a system. Critically this is not just to do with funding – or staff or beds or computers (though we we do not have enough of these things either). It is in the structure the way the system is wired. Our public hospital system and private medical sector are intermingled in a way that is inefficient unfair and highly unusual.

In our primary care sector we are the only European nation without universal access to GP care. In other words we are the only country where the majority of citizens – those without a medical card – must pay out of pocket and in full to see a GP. The fact that this arrangement is longstanding does not make it right.

[ Junior doctors are drowning in a health system in perpetual crisis ]

More importantly I truly believe that nobody wins from the status quo. Citizens – all of us – get a bad deal. If you don’t have private health insurance it means you may wait months or years before you can access many critical forms of care from knee replacements to children’s disability assessments to reassurance about a worrying mole. This is unfair. If you do have private insurance it means you are paying for the same thing twice: through tax and also through your insurance premium. And in the end you’re probably going to rely on the public system anyway.

This too is unfair. And if you are a healthcare worker you must continually navigate a system that is overburdened disjointed and running on fumes.

Sláintecare is a political process that seeks to address many of these issues by transitioning Ireland to a universal exchequer-funded model. I support this aspiration. However many are wary of health reform and ask valid questions. Without the requisite funding and follow-through what if reform just makes the system worse? What if waiting lists get longer not shorter? What if working conditions get worse not better? The answer to all these questions put simply is that reform only works if we make it work.

We – doctors patients citizens – must take responsibility for the system for it is ours. As a collective doctors in particular have something of a mixed record when it comes to progressive health reforms. In fact we generally oppose them. Some prefer the status quo. New consultants may still be attracted overseas ahead of a public-only contract. Existent consultants may prefer the greater freedom – and private income – of their current contract and decline to move to the new one. Yet doctors are not a monolith. This time last year Doctors For Universal Healthcare launched an open letter signed by more than 300 doctors from all specialties and grades calling for universal healthcare for Ireland.

The achievement of universal healthcare must be an absolutely central aim of all those who wish to bring about a decent and truly modern Irish society fit for the next century

I would like to work in a universal health system. One in which surgeons have access to the theatre space they need in public hospitals without relying endlessly on outsourcing to the private sector. One in which GPs have the resources to look after their patients and communities in the holistic way they are trained to. One in which no child waits for basic healthcare regardless of whether or not their parents can find the money for insurance.

This is a system in which doctors will want to work.

The key question ultimately is whether this contract offer – in the form it seems likely to take – makes such a system overall more or less likely. Opinions will differ. My instinct is that it makes it more likely – but only if it is accompanied by the right policy decisions especially a shift from endless outsourcing to a major investment in the public system’s capacity for elective and outpatient care.

In 1922 the Independent Free State came into being. We took our place among the nations of the world. While there is much to celebrate so too must we reflect on where we still fall short. The achievement of universal healthcare must be an absolutely central aim of all those who wish to bring about a decent and truly modern Irish society fit for the next century. In such a big system it is rare to get the chance to chart a new course. We find ourselves at a turning point – but reform will only work if we make it work. Now is the time.

This regional workshop is the first to take place following the launch of the NCD facility-based monitoring guidance developed by WHO for NCD patient and programme monitoring. It includes a framework and a set of relevant valid and feasible standardized indicators to guide recording and reporting of health services data at the primary care level. The regional workshop was organized by the NCD Surveillance Programme at the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean and the Surveillance Monitoring and Reporting Team at WHO headquarters in collaboration with the Department of Communicable Diseases and the Department of Science Information and Dissemination at the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean.

During this 3-day workshop discussions focused on: understanding the requirements (concepts methods etc.) for building a solid NCD monitoring system at primary health care level; sharing country experiences regarding implementation of NCD monitoring systems at primary health care level; and identifying the support needed from WHO and a way forward for countries to strengthen and implement NCD monitoring systems at primary health care level across the Region.

The NCD epidemic is a real and growing threat in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. It is the leading cause of death in the Region killing more than 2.8 million people every year – 1 in 4 of these deaths is premature occurring before the age of 70. These data show the scale of the NCD epidemic which poses a challenge to achieving universal health coverage health-related Sustainable Development Goals and the regional vision of ‘Health for all by all’. For the majority of people living with NCDs data show that they remain outside the health system with their conditions unmanaged.

Countries need accurate quality data to obtain a more holistic picture for the management and control of NCDs. In this case data from health facilities is essential and should be used to complement data from population-based surveys. However insufficient attention has been given to monitoring NCDs in health systems particularly at primary health care level. And in cases where NCDs are monitored at primary health care level there are gaps in the accuracy quality and standardization of these data. Also gaps exist in monitoring and reporting of NCD outcomes. Moreover data from health facilities are rarely linked to other sources of data.

Countries can use the framework from the NCD facility-based monitoring guidance to strengthen NCD monitoring by leveraging existing national health information systems particularly routine health facility reporting systems and health facility survey systems. The regional workshop set the scene in this direction paving the way for countries to continue working towards strengthening and implementing NCD monitoring systems at primary health care level for better management and control of NCDs. In the run up to 2030 WHO will continue to support countries to bridge gaps in data towards achieving universal health coverage reducing premature deaths from NCDs by one third by 2030 (Sustainable Development Goal target 3.4) and the regional vision of ‘Health for all by all’.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY290c21hbi5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC93aGVyZS1hcmUtdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1iZXN0LWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtc3lzdGVtcy1hbmQtd2h5LWhvdy1kby10aGV5LWNvbXBhcmUtdG8tc2NvdGxhbmQtYW5kLWNvdWxkLXdlLWFkb3B0LW9uZS1oZXJlLTM5NTYwNzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where are the world's best healthcare systems and why are they so successful?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.scotsman.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/world/where-are-the-worlds-best-healthcare-systems-and-why-how-do-they-compare-to-scotland-and-could-we-adopt-one-here-3956077 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D802B8640>, 'Connection to www.scotsman.com timed out.

On a sunny day Kwizera retained his title in style while Niyonsaba was successful when making her first ever cross country appearance on Spanish soil.

Unstoppable Kwizera

The 10575m men’s event saw Spain's Adel Mechaal at the head of the group in the opening stages ahead of the overwhelming favourite Kwizera his fellow Burundian Agide Nduwimana Morocco's Abderrahmane Aferdi and Portugal's Etson Barros as well as Spain's Abdessamad Oukhelfen and his brother Abdennasser. But before the third kilometre the leading pack whittled down to four athletes: Mechaal Oukhelfen Kwizera and Aferdi.

Kwizera made his first serious move some 4.5km into the race when he took the lead for the first time to increase the pace. Only Oukhelfen the 2019 European U23 cross country bronze medallist who was 10th in the senior race at the recent event in Italy could live with his change of speed. The 24-year-old Spaniard later overtook Kwizera but his lead was short lived as the Burundian regained the top spot with a brisk 6:46 lap some 15 seconds faster than the previous one. By then the leading duo travelled five seconds clear of Mechaal himself four seconds ahead of Aferdi.

It was at the beginning of the penultimate circuit that the Spain-based Kwizera decided to break away from Oukhelfen and he easily left the Spaniard well behind in a matter of a few metres. Kwizera reached the bell after another quick loop of 6:45 with Oukhelfen seven seconds in arrears and Mechaal another eight seconds adrift. Whenever Oukhelfen tried to approach Kwizera the Burundian easilly changed his speed to strengthen his lead.

At the tape the winner clocked 34:06 and was some 100m ahead of Oukhelfen while Mechaal came third 36 seconds behind the winner.

""This is my third win on this year's Cross Country Tour after my wins in Amorebieta and Alcobendas so I'm really satisfied"" said Kwizera. ""I'll now go back to my altitude training in Sierra Nevada and my next event will be the Cinque Mulini cross country on 15 January.""

Niyonsaba in a class of her own

It was Spanish steeplechaser Irene Sanchez-Escribano who was the early leader of the 7975m event closely followed by Niyonsaba Turkey's Emine Mechaal and Spaniards Marta Garcia Isabel Barreiro and Carolina Robles among others.

Some seven minutes into the race the Burundian took the lead to inject a faster pace and force her opponents to run in single file behind her. By the third kilometre Niyonsaba had built a five-second margin on Sanchez-Escribano and Barreiro themselves 12 seconds clear of a four-strong group featurng Mechaal Garcia Robles and Cristina Ruiz.

After covering the first big (2200m) lap in 7:54 Niyonsaba increased her lead to nine seconds ahead of the chasing duo of Sanchez-Escribano and Barreiro while Mechaal travelled alone in fourth and Ruiz dropped Garcia and Robles.

At the bell – after clocking 7:48 for the penultimate loop – Niyonsaba became a virtual winner as she ran 15 seconds ahead of the Spanish pair. Over the course of the last circuit Sanchez-Escribano managed to break away from Barreiro while Niyonsaba remained unopposed at the helm. Once she had secured the win the Burundian slowed her pace and ran 7:59 for the closing lap but even so she crossed the finish line 11 seconds ahead of Escribano herself eight seconds clear of Barreiro.

""The circuit was tough over some sections so I decided to kick off conservatively"" said Niyonsaba. ""I'm delighted with my first win at a cross country race and hope to compete at the World Cross Country Championships in Bathurst.

""After a training stint in Kenya and today's race I now return to Burundi but I'll come back in three weeks to compete at the Elgoibar cross country event on 8 January.""

Las compras se habían mantenido reprimidas ante el contexto de incertidumbre primero por la crisis sanitaria y después por la crisis político-militar desatada por la invasión de Rusia a Ucrania que restringió además en forma considerable el abasto de componentes estratégicos para la fabricación de automóviles.

Toda vez que la adquisición de los vehículos de alta gama tiene que ver con la tendencia en las tasas de interés a nivel global y su relación con el aumento en la inflación.

Luego de cinco años consecutivos de baja en los que las ventas del mejor mes del año dibujaron una sostenida tendencia de baja en 2021 tocaron fondo con una caída anual del 39.4% con tan sólo mil 723 unidades vendidas.

En el cross de Venta de Baños Rodrigue Kwizera no cedió ante Abdessamad Oukhelfen ni siquiera porque fuera el cumpleaños del español. Entre las mujeres no hubo discusión en la victoria de Francine Niyonsaba.

La prueba en la localidad palentina contaba con Rodrigue Kwizera como el principal candidato al título. Y el corredor burundés del Playas de Castellón confirmó su superioridad en el campo a través cruzando la meta después de 10 kilómetros y 575 metros en primer lugar para orgullo de su entrenador Pepe Ortuño.

Quien más cerca estuvo de evitar el triunfo del africano fue Abdessamad Oukhelfen décimo en el campeonato de Europa de campo a través en Turín una semana antes. El día en que soplaba 24 velas corrió una buena prueba que le permitió superar a Adel Mechaal quien no acudió a la prueba continental.

Lo cierto es que Mechaal intentó sorprender en el circuito embarrado. De hecho aprovechó el estado de forma tras haber ganado varias pruebas de cross en España durante el mes de diciembre para encabezar la carrera en la primera mitad. No obstante no pudo resistir el empuje de sus dos principales rivales y tuvo que conformarse con el podio.

Francine Niyonsaba se estrena en el campo a través en España

Entre las mujeres se erigió otra atleta de Burundi. Desde el comienzo Francine Niyonsaba subcampeona olímpica en Río 2016 firmó un liderazgo con autoridad ante cualquier tímido intento de mantener su ritmo. La africana ha tenido que enrolarse en pruebas femeninas de más de una milla de distancia debido a sus altos niveles de testosterona. Con 29 años ha encajado en el cross con buen pie y nadie fue capaz de hacer sombra a su zancada en los 7.775 metros de recorrido.



Las españolas Irense Sánchez-Escribano e Isabel Barreiro mantuvieron otro de sus interesantes duelos en el campo a través con la segunda plaza como objetivo. Esta vez ganó la toledana en la despedida del año del World Athletics Cross Country Tour.

Doce años después el mercado de tablets es cada vez más cosa de dos. Y no reverdece sus laurales: las ventas de sus años dorados no han podido ser igualadas ni siquiera con el empujón de ventas que supuso la pandemia.

Un duopolio mucho más acentuado que en el móvil

El informe trimestral de IDC sobre las ventas de tablets nos deja ver sus cifras acumuladas. La tendencia es clarísima: ventas a la baja año tras año que solo cambiaron de rumbo con la mencionada pandemia. Y en 2022 con la pandemia siendo poco más que un mal recuerdo en la mayoría de países occidentales esa tendencia vuelve a revertirse.

El mínimo fueron 144 millones de unidades vendidas en 2019. Subió a 169 millones al finalizar 2021. Para 2022 no hay datos hasta que termine este último trimestre pero una proyección basada en los datos de los primeros nueve meses del año y los aumentos habituales de ese último trimestre (muy exitoso por combinar la campaña navideña con el Black Friday) deja otra caída respecto al año pasado.

Además este mercado es cada vez más cosa de dos. Concretamente de Apple y de Samsung. Aquí hay que matizar que Microsoft se queda fuera de esta ecuación porque incorpora un sistema operativo de escritorio incluso en dispositivos cuyo factor de forma es muy similar al de los iPad que siguen incorporando iPadOS. Así y todo es justo decir que los pasos de Apple en el mercado de tablets se han acercado cada vez más a lo que propuso Microsoft ya en 2012.

En este mercado Apple que fue perdiendo cuota de mercado en los primeros años tras el iPad original al compás de los fabricantes que se fueron incorporando y ofreciendo productos más baratos; ha acabado recuperando el terreno perdido. Se ha consolidado como líder de esta categoría superando con holgura los cincuenta millones de productos vendidos en los últimos años que le valen para lograr cuotas de mercado por encima del 33%.

Samsung protagonista perenne del segundo puesto siguió una trayectoria similar con sus Galaxy Tab y también ha consolidado su posición en estos últimos años logrando un aumento de ventas que lleva sosteniendo desde que llegó la pandemia.

Las otras tres que completan el ranking de las cinco principales son Amazon con sus Fire; Lenovo y una Huawei que llegó a ser tercera pero ya es quinta desde que entró en barrena víctima de la guerra comercial desde 2019. Lenovo por cierto no ha llegado ahí por casualidad y está lanzando tablets basadas en Android cada vez más solventes.

Y un hecho destacable adicional: los fabricantes alternativos a ese ranking cada vez venden menos. La combinación de esas alternativas llegó a suponer más de la mitad del mercado en 2015 pero desde entonces ha ido cayendo y ya supone menos del 25%.

Las tablets llegaron a nuestras vidas rodeadas de expectativas que en muchos casos no han podido cumplir postulándose (o siendo postuladas) como las sucesoras de los ordenadores como el siguiente producto masivo tras el smartphone llamado a lograr una capilaridad similar.

Otro factor que explica las ventas a la baja es que la durabilidad de este producto menos expuesto a caídas que el smartphone y su uso inferior le permiten ciclos de renovación largos muy superiores a los de un smartphone que ya se acerca a los tres años en promedio.

Ya entrados en esta de´cada y vislumbrada la vida post-pandemia las expectativas ya son muy diferentes: las tablets son un mercado de poco más que dos que no despiertan tanto interés como se esperaba y duran demasiado tiempo siendo funcionales como para esperar renovaciones recurrentes."

If anything at least we see 5G icons in our status bars on most days although that connection ranges from slower than LTE to faster than our home internet at any given moment. It’s not the 5G we were promised but it is technically here.

I bring up 5G because the entire US carrier ecosystem is now built around who has the best 5G thanks to a combination of who can claim to cover the most people on 5G and how fast that 5G is. 5G is basically the only thing carriers want to talk about because they reintroduced unlimited plans a few years back and have adjusted those in all the ways possible in order to capture your attention and get you to stick around or switch over. They are out of ideas there. 5G is how they believe they can standout from competitors.

And in that 5G race I think it’s obvious that T-Mobile took the lead some time ago and likely won’t give it up any time soon. They are standing out from AT&T and Verizon in 5G. Stories like this one from Bloomberg capture this as T-Mobile’s 5G lead has led to a handful of rocky years for Verizon where heads of their consumer unit have departed because of slow growth. There are quotes in that story from analysts who also believe that Verizon screwed up its early 5G bet and may have lost its network leadership position an idea that was unthinkable at one time for the US’ biggest carrier.

The readers of this site were at one point almost all Verizon customers. We started by covering a single device the original Motorola Droid which was exclusive to Verizon so it made sense. But as the years have passed (13 years of DL!) there has no doubt been a switch from many to T-Mobile – AT&T not as much. The polls tell the story. There are also those who continue on with Verizon and may never switch away and they almost always tell us it’s because of the network where they live.

As interesting as the story is that Verizon has lost some of its network reputation and that T-Mobile continues to shine I can’t help but wonder if there’s something else driving the slow growth from Verizon beyond choosing the wrong 5G network out of the gate. Are customers simply unhappy with everything from Verizon not just 5G? Or is the network in a bad enough spot overall that finding another carrier is a thing that’s happening? Maybe you finally feel comfortable with another carrier for the first time?

Let’s talk about it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvdmVyaXpvbi1naWZ0LWNhcmRzX2lkMTQ0MzMy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some lucky Verizon customers are finding a $25 gift card in the My Verizon app,"If you're a Verizon subscriber and signed up for the Verizon Up reward program you might have a $25 gift card waiting for you in the My Verizon app. The app can be installed from both the App Store and the Google Play Store . To claim the prize open the app and tap the Verizon Up tab at the bottom of the screen. Go to the section with the header that reads ""Browse featured offers"" and there will be your gift from Verizon. The box showing the offer says ""Here’s your $25 Verizon Gift Card on us.""





Tap on the box to claim the offer. You will be sent to a page giving you the gift card code and the PIN number that you will need in order to use the card when you checkout of the transaction that you are using the $25 gift card toward. That can be anything from a new device to a new case for your phone. You can even use it to knock $25 off of your Verizon bill.









Now to be precise Verizon says that the $25 gift cards ""can be used to pay a Verizon Wireless or Fios bill"" and can be used for ""merchandise & services at stores/kiosks operated by Verizon or at verizon.com."" As pointed out by Droid-Life  the only place associated with Verizon where you cannot use it is at a Verizon Authorized Retailer.





We're not sure how Verizon chooses which of its subscribers will receive a $25 gift card. We know of a long-time Verizon customer who has been a subscriber for more than 15 years with the carrier and pays a pretty big invoice each month. This person has signed up with Verizon Up and yet they did not receive the $25 gift card offer. We can pretty much rule out loyalty being a determining factor and would have to guess that it is all the luck of the draw.

If you're screening for high dividend-yielding stocks it's likely Verizon (VZ 1.53%) and AT&T (T -0.06%) have come to your attention. Verizon is currently yielding an eye-popping 7% and AT&T yields slightly less at 5.8%. When stocks reach this level of yield over a sustained period (sometimes because the stock price has fallen significantly) it's often a warning sign that the stock is in trouble and might not be able to keep up this level of payout. The stock sells off further exaggerating its yield and creating a vicious cycle that only ends when the dividend is finally cut (or worse suspended).

So is this the case with these two large telecoms? Let's find out if investors have a reason to worry about the dividend payout of these two.

Q3 was solid for both companies

The past 18 months have been tumultuous for AT&T. It sold DirecTV to a private equity firm in August 2021 and spun off Warner Media to merge with Discovery Communications and help create Warner Bros. Discovery in April. Both actions changed the fundamental makeup of AT&T's business reverting the company back to its more telecom-focused state.

Verizon's business over this time period is more straightforward and unchanged as it hasn't made the same major adjustments as AT&T. But these businesses are now easier to compare with each primarily focusing on internet and phone subscriptions.

In the third quarter both companies reported solid results for their industry.

Company Q3 Revenue Q3 Revenue Growth (YOY) AT&T $30 billion 3.1% Verizon $34.2 billion 4%

Bear in mind AT&T and Verizon are not rapidly growing tech stocks; they are mature businesses that generate a bigger portion of shareholder returns through dividends. These aren't bad results for either company and are above-average growth rates compared to the past decade.

So the growth these two generate is enough to maintain a dividend. But what about expenses?

Both companies are in great shape to pay their dividends

I like to assess the dividend payout ratio how much of a company's profits are paid out as dividends in two ways: From an earnings perspective and a free cash flow perspective. In 2022 Verizon produced $1.17 in earnings per share (EPS) and $12.4 billion in free cash flow (FCF). Compared to the $8.1 billion in dividends it paid ($0.652 per share dividend) that equates to a 55.7% payout ratio from an EPS perspective and a 65.3% payout ratio from on an FCF basis. Those are healthy ratios but if Verizon maintains its current trend those metrics could worsen.

2022 FCF was down from $17.3 billion last year so Verizon will need to control its cash expenses or eventually risk a dividend cut. On the plus side it some ways to go before that would be necessary.

AT&T cut its dividend earlier this year so that bad taste is fresh in investors' mouths. However the cut was because of its Warner Bros. Discovery spin-off not because of profit issues. AT&T looks healthy moving forward. The company projects to earn about $14 billion in FCF this year much greater than its $8 billion dividend payout. Additionally its EPS for Q3 was $0.79 significantly higher than its $0.2775 quarterly per-share dividend payout.

So both companies are well on track to meet their dividend obligations which should ease investor worry. Then why are their dividend yields so high?

Treasuries are partly to blame

As the 10-year Treasury note's yield rose Verizon's stock fell.

AT&T's stock experienced a similar action although its movement was likely more influenced by its April spinoffs. The drop in both stocks all boils down to one thing: investors' desire for a rising risk-free savings rate. As the rate on Treasuries rose investors saw they could get risk-free yield (as long as the U.S. doesn't default on its debt) from buying Treasury assets rather than holding these comparatively riskier stocks. So their stock prices fell as investors sold off to pile into Treasuries or other similar-type lower-risk investments with more favorable return profiles. The sell-off helped push up the dividend yield on the stocks.

So should you buy Verizon and AT&T stock for 2023?

My answer? No.

Both stocks have significantly underperformed the broader market over the past five years even when dividends are included.

While the dividend yields may be enticing the long-term performance of the broader market is just a better place to invest money. The dividends may be safe but they come at the price of significant underperformance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhjY29tbXVuaXR5am91cm5hbC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZV8zMTU3N2JiMi03YjExLTExZWQtYjhlOC04ZjNkYjllYTYzY2UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,West Central sells to Verizon | | hccommunityjournal.com,One of the last independent cell phone service providers has sold to Verizon recently.

For a company like Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.91%) 10 years isn't a long time. The drug-development process takes between 12 and 14 years on average around 8 years of which are devoted to clinical-stage testing and the regulatory-review process. That means the Vertex of today could well be an entirely different business in a decade's time which can make it hard to plan for making a long-term investment.

Luckily with a little bit of diligence we can map out roughly where a drug company is trying to go and we can even make a few solid predictions about how successful it'll be in those attempts so that you can judge whether it might be a worthy addition to your portfolio. Let's dive in and see what the future could look like for this innovative drug developer.

Expect its drug portfolio to more than double

Our starting point for projecting Vertex's future is the reasonable assumption that at least some of its early-stage clinical programs will make it to the market and generate fresh revenue by 2032. It might even commercialize some of its more advanced pre-clinical projects too.

Right now Vertex has six drugs on the market which took in $7.5 billion of revenue in 2021. All of them target cystic fibrosis (CF) a rare inherited pulmonary disease that makes it very difficult for people to breathe due to problems with the fluids in their lungs. Sales of CF therapies have powered the company's net income which grew some 1140% over the last five years. Now management has its sights set on entering other therapy markets to diversify.

Looking at its pipeline there are 18 programs which have a credible chance of being commercialized over the next 10 years. These run the gamut of indications and the company will almost certainly succeed in diversifying outside of CF perhaps by advancing its candidates for sickle cell disease APOL1-mediated kidney disease or pain relief. But it's impossible to tell which of its candidates will be proven safe and effective and which will get canned after lackluster results.

Luckily with some information about clinical-trial success rates and a little bit of math we can make some predictions about roughly how many new medicines to expect by our target date. On average 20.9% of pharmaceutical projects in phase 1 clinical trials for indications outside of oncology will eventually go on to be commercialized whereas future success rates are as high as 55.7% for phase 2 projects and 63.6% for those in phase 3.

Therefore Vertex will likely be able to commercialize three or four of its programs that are currently in phase 3 but it's a toss-up as to whether it'll manage to get its lone phase 2 program out the door. Likewise of its six candidates in phase 1 investors should only expect one to make it to the market though there is a distant chance for two.

In total the company could reasonably be expected to have five new medicines for sale by 2032. It's impossible to say precisely how much money those new medicines would be worth annually but it's not hyperbolic to predict at least several billions of dollars in new revenue.

What's more some of the new drugs are being developed for indications like acute pain and type 1 diabetes both of which have vastly larger markets than CF therapies. The actual amount of growth that investors will see depends on which medicines Vertex succeeds in commercializing and whether there's a significant amount of competition for market share with each but the chances are very good that the business will multiply in value by at least a few times.

Expect CF medicines to remain a cornerstone

In the meantime Vertex's revenue from its CF therapies is unlikely to decline by much. Patients don't have any other options for treatment and the company's ability to remix its existing CF medicines into more potent (and more convenient) combinations should ensure that patients' needs continue to be met more effectively over time as shown by the success of its numerous combination-therapy drugs for CF.

So Vertex's future looks quite bright and in 10 years it should be a much larger and more diversified business which means it'll also be somewhat lower risk as an investment than it is today. Plus our forecast of progress in its drug pipeline entails the very high chance of numerous stumbles in clinical trials along the way.

For an investor looking to start a position in the stock a sub-optimal clinical-trial outcome is an opportunity to buy shares while prices are less than usual. But for those who would prefer not to wait the stock is ripe for purchasing today for a long-term hold provided that you have the fortitude to continue holding your shares through the bumpy patches of the drug-development process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzE3L3Nob3VsZC15b3UtYnV5LXN0b2Nrcy1pZi1yZWNlc3Npb24tY29taW5nLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should You Buy Stocks If a Recession Is Coming in 2023?

Does Vici own everything now? Can you please give us a rundown of what Vici owns and who pays rent and how much?

A:

On the east side of the Strip Vici owns Venetian/Palazzo Harrah's and MGM Grand; on the west Mirage Caesars Palace Park MGM Excalibur Luxor New York-New York and Mandalay Bay.

Vici is the landlord for all these properties while MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment own the operations.

Vici also owns 30-odd other casino properties around the U.S. including Harrah's Laughlin and Lake Tahoe; Harvey's Lake Tahoe; Harrah's in Council Bluffs North Kansas City New Orleans Gulf Coast Metropolis Joliet Atlantic City and Philadelphia; and several Horseshoes MGMs Caesars and others. More than half of the rent that Vici collects comes from outside of Las Vegas.

As you mention Vici owned only half of MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay but it bought the other half from Blackstone recently. Blackstone still owns Bellagio and the Cosmopolitan whose operations are owned by MGM Resorts.

As to how much rent Vici collects with the MBay/MGM acquisition it's nearing $3 billion per year. Breaking down exactly who pays exactly what for each property is beyond what we can do but here are some examples.

MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay will pay $310 million. Venetian/Palazzo pays $250 million a year. The Mirage which will be owned by Hard Rock starting tomorrow now that the Gaming Commission approved the sale (on Friday) will pay $90 million.

Vici is a publicly traded company. You can buy its stock and own a piece of all these casino renters. The stock as of this writing is trading around $34.",,,,,,,,,,,,

On a humid morning the information technology professional was waiting outside the temple the size of a small closet – barely enough room for the lone priest to stand and perform puja or rituals for the beloved elephant-headed deity believed to be the remover of obstacles.

Viswanathan was among about a dozen visitors most of them there for the same purpose: To offer prayers so their U.S. visa interviews would go smoothly and successfully. Viswanathan came the day before his interview for an employment visa.

“I came here to pray for my brother’s U.K. visa 10 years ago and for my wife’s U.S. visa two years ago” he said. “They were both successful. So I have faith.""

The Sri Lakshmi Visa Ganapathy Temple is a few miles north of the airport in Chennai (formerly Madras) a bustling metropolis on the Coromandel Coast in southeast India -- known for its iconic cuisine ancient temples and churches silk saris classical music dance and sculptures.

This “visa temple” has surged in popularity among U.S. visa seekers over the past decade; they can be found in almost any Indian city with a U.S. consulate. They typically gain a following through word of mouth or social media.

A mile away from the Ganesh temple is the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Navaneetha Krishnan Temple where an idol of Hanuman – a deity who has a human body and the face of a monkey — is believed to possess the power to secure visas. Also known as “Anjaneya” this god stands for strength wisdom and devotion. In this temple he has earned the monikers “America Anjaneya” and “Visa Anjaneya.”

The temple’s longtime secretary G.C. Srinivasan said it wasn’t until 2016 that this temple became a “visa temple.”

“It was around that time that a few people who prayed for a visa spread the word around that they were successful and it's continued” he said.

A month ago Srinivasan said he met someone who got news of his visa approval even as as he was circumambulating the Anjaneya idol — a common Hindu practice of walking around a sacred object or site.

On a recent Saturday night devotees decorated the idol with garlands made of betel leaves. S. Pradeep who placed a garland on the deity said he was not there to pray for a visa but believes in the god's unique power.

“He is my favorite god” he said. “If you genuinely pray – not just for visa – it will come true.”

At the Ganesh temple some devotees had success stories to share. Jyothi Bontha said her visa interview at the U.S. Consulate in Chennai went without a hitch and that she had returned to offer thanks.

“They barely asked me a couple of questions” she said. “I was pleasantly surprised.”

Bontha’s friend Phani Veeranki stood nearby nervously clutching an envelope containing her visa application and supporting documents. Bontha and Veeranki both computer science students from the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh and childhood friends are headed to Ohio.

Both learned about the visa temple on the social media platform Telegram.

Veeranki said she was anxious because she had a lot riding on her upcoming visa interview.

“I’m the first person in my family to go the United States” she said. “My mother is afraid to send me. But I’m excited for the opportunities I’ll have in America.”

Veeranki then handed over the envelope to the temple’s priest for him to place at the foot of the idol for a blessing.

“We’ve been hearing about applications being rejected” she said her hands still folded in prayer. “I’m really hoping mine gets approved.”

If she and Bontha make it to Ohio they want to take a trip to Niagara Falls.

“I’ve always wanted to see it” Bontha said.

Mohanbabu Jagannathan and his wife Sangeetha run the temple which Jagannathan's grandfather built in 1987. Their house is on a cul-de-sac which is considered bad luck in several Asian cultures. In Chennai it is common to find a Ganesh temple outside cul-de-sac homes due to the belief that the deity has the power to ward off evil. At first only neighbors came to the temple Jagannathan said.

“But over the years it started earning a quirky reputation"" he said. ""A lot of visa applicants who came to the temple spread the word that they found success after praying here.”

In 2009 his father Jagannathan Radhakrishnan reconstructed the temple and added the word “visa” to the temple’s name. Jagannathan said the success stories are heartwarming; visitors sometimes stop by his home to thank his family for keeping the temple open.

“I’ve never been bothered by it” Jagannathan said. “We offer this as a service to the public. It’s a joy to see how happy people are when they come back and tell us they got their visa.”

His wife said she was touched by the story of a man who came all the way from New Delhi to pray for a visa to see his grandchild after eight years apart. She remembers another time when a woman called her in tears saying her visa application was rejected.

“Sure some don’t get it” she said. “God only knows why.”

Padma Kannan brought her daughter Monisha who is preparing to pursue a master’s degree in marketing analytics in Clark University. Kannan believes her daughter got her visa because of this powerful deity.

“I found this temple on Google” she said. “I was so nervous for her and so I prayed here.”

Monisha Kannan said she is not so sure she got her visa because of this temple but she said she came to support her mom.

“I’m skeptical” she said. “I’m just someone who goes with the flow.”

Her mother takes a more philosophical stance.

“We pray for our children and things happen easily for them” she said. “I think when they go through the rigors of life themselves they will start believing in the power of prayer.”

Viswanathan said he is not someone “who usually believes in such things.” When his brother got his British visa a decade ago after offering prayers here Viswanathan chalked it up to coincidence. He became a believer when his wife got her U.S. visa two years ago he said.

The day after he visited the temple this time Viswanathan's employment visa was approved. He’ll head to New Hampshire in a few months.

“It’s all about faith” he said. “If you believe it will happen it will happen.”

Is it mandatory to have travel insurance every time I fly to UAE?

In the UAE a five-year multiple-entry tourist visa has been introduced by the Cabinet Decision No. 65 of 2022.

Article 15 of the Cabinet Decision sets forth the conditions and qualifications to obtain the five-year multiple-entry tourist visa.

Under UAE law the authority may issue a multi-visit visa for the purpose of tourism that is valid for five years without requiring a guarantor. The applicant is required to provide evidence of a bank balance of $4000 or its equivalent in foreign currencies during the last six months preceding the submission of the application.

The multiple-entry tourist visa allows the beneficiary to stay in the country for a continuous period not exceeding 90 days; the Authority may extend it for a similar period provided that the full period of stay does not exceed 180 days in one year.

The period of stay may be extended for a period of more than 180 days per year in exceptional cases to be determined by a decision of the President.

Article 15 of the Cabinet Decision doesn’t have any specific conditions regarding health insurance. But at the website of the UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity Citizenship Customs and Ports Security (ICP) one of the pre-conditions for issuance of the visa is for the applicant to submit a valid health insurance document approved in the UAE for the applicant and proof of a health insurance policy for the applicant’s family members.

Furthermore upon enquiry the ICP confirmed that a multiple-entry visit visa holder must obtain valid health insurance coverage approved in the UAE for each trip to the country for the applicant and the applicant’s accompanying family members. Such health insurance policy should sufficiently cover their entire period of stay in the UAE.

Therefore it is indeed mandatory for the multiple entry visa holder to have health insurance policy coverage approved in the UAE every time they fly to the UAE and such policy should cover the duration of their stay in the country.

The move comes after new rules came into effect earlier this week which discontinued the option allowing visit visa holders in the UAE to extend their visas from within the country according to travel agencies.

Here are some of the packages that are now on offer:

Exit by bus: From Dh599 to Dh850

Online travel agency Musafir.com are offering a visa change package by bus for Dh799.

Ajwah Tours is offering visitors the option to change visas status by bus. The company is offering a 30-day visa starting from Dh599 and a 60-day visa for Dh799. However GM Malik Bedekar said that buses are running on full capacity.

“Because the rules have come into place so suddenly there is immense demand for buses” he said.

“Right now all my bookings are full till the end of this month. Also this option is only available for those holding passports of India Philippines Nepal and Sri Lanka. Those of Pakistani nationality and hailing from the African continent are not permitted to exit by bus.”

Visa renewal by exiting the country via bus to Oman will cost Dh850 a spokesperson from Anisha Tours and Travels says. “However we are giving this option only to those who need to exit urgently as buses are running almost completely full till the end of this month” said Anish Mukil from the agency.

Airport-to-airport: From Dh999 to Dh1999

Musafir.com offers an airport-to-airport visa change service for Dh1100.

Whereas Ajwah Tours is offering a 30-day visa that allows visitors to exit and re-enter the country by air starting from Dh999 and a 60-day visa starting from Dh1999.

Visitors wish to travel to Oman by air can also choose a package offered by Anisha tours which begins from Dh1250.

Dubai-based Smart Travels is also offering similar packages to Oman on Fly Dubai flights for Dh1050 for a 30-day visa and Dh1300 for 60-day visa.

Within the country: From Dh1800 to Dh2200

A spokesperson from Musafir.com says the agency is also offering a visit visa change from inside Dubai for a price of Dh1800.

Anisha Tours and Travels is also offering visitors an option to renew their visas from within Dubai for Dh2200.

Visitors must exit the country once their visa validity is over. Those who have secured a job in the country or are planning to opt for a residency visa must also exit the country and re-enter for the status change to be effective.

According to industry experts the move is aiming to crack down on those who have been staying in the country indefinitely on visit visas.

The regulation to exit the country to change visit visa status was always in place. It was during the Covid-19 pandemic that the UAE amended rules to allow for a visa status change from within the country due to humanitarian concerns.

Several other travel agencies in the country said they are expecting to release similar packages during the coming days.

But she still struggles to make ends meet.

A long-time supervisor at Magic Kingdom attractions like Thunder Mountain and Tom Sawyer Island she lives with her husband Zac —who also works for Disney in transportation maintenance — and teenage daughter Chastity in a small three-bedroom house that she rents from a relative. Their combined salaries in the low five figures are barely enough to pay the rent or put food on the table.

“There have definitely been times when it’s like ‘OK kids there’s rice for tonight then rice tomorrow but there will be different sides with the rice’ ” she confided to author and NYU cultural studies professor Andrew Ross in his new book “Sunbelt Blues: The Failure of American Housing” (Metropolitan Books) out now.

She has no savings no nest egg and sometimes not enough gas money to make the hour-and-a-half commute (one way) to the Magic Kingdom. On nights when she doesn’t have enough cash to make it home she sleeps in the parking lot. When she does make it home it’s usually after midnight and she has just enough energy left to cook dinner for her family for the next day.

But despite Alcantara-Anderson’s financial struggles it’s never stopped her from loaning cash to fellow “cast members” (as Disney employees are) who can’t get enough to eat.

12 Fun is certainly lucrative at Disney World. During the first few months of 2022 the company’s parks division generated $7.2 billion in revenue. AP

As she told Ross there are at least nine guys on her team who live in the same two-bedroom apartment with air mattresses sleeping bags and a couch. “They rotate through who gets the bed on certain nights” she says. “They only have one bathroom so they have to ration shower time and their clothes are all in trash bags.”

Their grim living conditions make for a stark contrast with Disney World’s reputation as the “Happiest Place on Earth” — not to mention the most profitable. During the first few months of 2022 the Walt Disney Company already netted $29.8 billion in revenue the second-best quarter of all time for the company. Some $7.2 billion of that came from Disney parks. And yet most of the 78000 workers at Disney World’s four parks “are paid a poverty wage” Ross writes. (Walt Disney World did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.)

It’s not just a Florida problem. A 2018 study by Occidental College and the Economic Roundtable looked at working conditions for employees at Disneyland — the company’s original park in Anaheim Calif. — and found that more than half worried about being evicted from their homes and more than one in 10 had been homeless in the last two years.

“Disney ideally wants the guests to believe theme park employees are happy-go-lucky kids doing this job for fun” says Alcantara-Anderson. So the company takes pains to conceal the fact that “most of us are career employees who have pensions at least if we are union at the end of our work lives” she says.

Many are forced to stay at any of the “extended stay” motels in the area Ross writes.

Like Ramona Gutiérrez a short-order cook at one of the Magic Kingdom’s biggest restaurants — she declined to name it — who lives at HomeSuiteHome a notorious motel whose owner once (unsuccessfully) sued the sheriff in 2015 for not evicting enough of her tenants.

“I never felt safe” Gutiérrez told Ross about her experience at the motel.

“It was crawling with bedbugs and then the ceiling collapsed on me. All this time I was working at the happiest place in the world and felt fulfilled in my job.”

It’s this irony that Ross encountered the most when interviewing Disney employees the fact that they both felt victimized by their jobs and completely enraptured by the pixie dust. Alcantara-Anderson for all her talk about the hardships that she endures because of Disney World doesn’t hesitate to mention the joy she felt “the first time I moved a guest to tears” letting a young visitor win at checkers and then giving him a Fast Pass as a reward.

But Ross adds these same employees “seemed perfectly capable of separating that emotional allegiance from their indignation about the mismatch between their low wages and area rents.” Some even admitted how the demands to remain eternally happy had wrecked havoc on their health.

Brian who operates the Splash Mountain ride at Disney’s Magic Kingdom admitted that he “has trouble finding the real me” after dropping his happy workplace face at the end of a shift. His co-worker Laura forewarns her husband “to give me 20 minutes” after she returns home from a shift “to deal with when I am screaming inside from the hurt and anger” she told Ross.

“It takes lots of mental fortitude to maintain that persona” says Alcantara-Anderson especially when you do not have a sunny disposition or “when there are personal troubles in your life.” And customers aren’t always forgiving. Alcantara-Anderson says she frequently receives complaints like “That cast member doesn’t look too happy” or “What’s wrong with her magic today?”

It isn’t enough for an employee to be constantly brimming with pixie dust giddiness. It needs to feel authentic. “Visitors are always on the lookout for fake emotions” Ross writes. “They have paid through the nose to visit an artificial landscape but they want real responses from the greeters guides and attendants.”

It’s a veneer that isn’t always easy if you slept in your car last night or if you’re not sure how you’re going to feed your family or pay rent next month.

When Walt Disney first unveiled EPCOT — short for Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow — he imagined it as he explained in a 1966 short film as a a solution “to the problems of our cities.” The 27400 acres or 43 square miles of central Florida that the Disney Company acquired a few years earlier would be used to create a utopia with “no slum areas” and “no landowners . . . People will rent houses instead of buying them and at modest rentals.”

Had this promise been carried out Ross writes “it would at least have created a kind of company town guaranteeing affordable housing for Disney World employees.” But this isn’t what happened. Instead the Disney corporation was granted a wide-ranging charter where they basically got to control their own utilities policing and fire service. “It is effectively a puppet government” Ross writes. (Though Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis promised to revoke that power back in April nothing is official yet and the conflict is still ongoing.)

Since 2018 Disney has purchased another 3000 acres of land. But most of it including the land they acquired in the ’60s remains undeveloped.

12 Despite working at the Magic Kingdom for more than two decades Mike Beaver had to move out of his home in 2018 and live in a hotel.

As for the “modest rentals” that the late Walt promised they never materialized. “Disney’s response to its employees’ acute housing needs has been dismal” Ross writes. The company “could easily make some of its large parcels of surplus land available for housing either for its own workers or for others who need it.” But instead Disney has remained true to its “Grinch-like reputation which dates back decades.”

Even Abigail Disney the granddaughter of Walt’s brother Roy has been critical of the company’s treatment of employees. In a 2019 interview she went after Disney CEO Bob Iger — whose 2018 earnings roughly $65 million were 1424 times the amount earned by a typical Disney employee. “He deserves to be rewarded” she said “but if at the same company people are on food stamps and the company’s never been more profitable . . . how can you let people go home hungry?”

Mike Beaver a longtime Magic Kingdom employee and union member shares Abigail Disney’s outrage. Although he’d been employed at Tomorrowland in Disney World’s Magic Kingdom for 21 years by 2018 his finances had hit such rock bottom that he moved out of his home and into a motel sharing a room with a friend at the Star Motel a notorious hot spot for drug deals.

“It’s not the greatest motel” Beaver admitted to Ross “but you don’t want to be out on the streets or be in a car.”

Since becoming a shop steward for his local union he doesn’t just see motel life as bad luck. Many of his neighbors he says are fellow Disney employees down on their luck as well. “I got to see firsthand how the families in there are struggling” Beaver said. “What I have experienced in this motel is a life-changing experience I’ll never forget and I’ll fight for the people that can’t do so for themselves.”

That fight was taken to Disney World’s front door in 2017 when protestors for the Service Trades Council Union — which represents several unions and approximately 43000 Disney cast members — marched at the park’s Crossroads entrance demanding a pay increase from $10 to $15 an hour.

“It looked for all the world like a picket at the dream factory gate” writes Ross. “But since the union contract forbids picketing it was billed as a ‘parade’.”

When that failed to make a convincing case another march was planned in April of 2018 near the Disney Springs entrance. Thousands of protestors carried picket signs and balloons with phrases like “End Disney Poverty.” The protest looked less like a parade this time with unsmiling employees chanting “We work we sweat put a raise on our check.”

12 Author and NYU Professor Andrew Ross’ new book chronicles the dire housing and economic straits faced by workers at Disney World.

In August 2018 the union reached a deal with Disney to gradually increase wages to $15 an hour by October 2021. It was a shocking victory for many Disney long-haulers.

“Not one cast member I knew thought we could get $15” said Alcantara-Anderson who’s also a shop steward at Local 362 which represents many of the lowest-paid cast members. The new union contract had the potential to help many of her co-workers “move off food stamps and into their own apartments” she says.

“Disney’s response to its employees’ acute housing needs has been dismal.” “Sunbelt Blues” author Andrew Ross

That’s exactly what happened for some. It allowed Gutiérrez the short-order cook to escape the seedy motel and rent a two-bedroom apartment. “I feel human” she says “living in a home that gives me some self-respect.”

Another cast member who made the move told Ross that she and her family “had our first Thanksgiving dinner when we didn’t have to sit on my son’s bed.”

Although Mike Beaver had enough income now to move he opted to stay at the Star Motel to help those Disney employees who still couldn’t afford to leave. He performed basic maintenance on the building and even stocked a food pantry in one of the vacated rooms.

“God has told me to stay here and to stand up for what’s right” he told Ross. “I am rattling the cages of the politicians because I am in a position to put them on notice about the problems in the motels and the low pay of cast members.”

Two months later the motel — which had gone into foreclosure for loan defaults and unpaid property taxes — was scheduled to be demolished and Beaver finally checked out and into the Sun Inn motel another low-cost housing option where he remains today.

12 One long-time Disney employee makes enough to keep her from sleeping in the parking lot but not enough for a home of her own close enough to the park to get back to her family before midnight.

In the end the slight bump in pay didn’t fix the housing crisis.

Cole Washington a security officer for Disney World has tried leaving the motels and renting an apartment but the prices keep going up. He suspects that whenever potential landlords “hear that I am Disney I’m sure they jack up the rent.”

Kareem Burrow another Disney employee has heard plenty of tales from his co-workers of landlords squeezing more rent after reading news reports of Disney raising wages. “There is a crazy perception that Disney workers are well off” he said.

Alcantara-Anderson has seen it happen every time Disney offers even a tiny raise. “When wages rise like a helium balloon rents shoot up like a Roman candle” she says. Which is why she’s staying in her rental home for now despite the long commute.

Since the union standoff Alcantara-Anderson — a woman who once won the Disney Heroes Award one of the park’s highest honors for performing CPR on a guest — is now making $17.70 an hour up from $11.50 five years earlier. It’s enough to keep her from sleeping in the parking lot because she can’t afford gas but not enough for a home of her own close enough to the park to get back to her family before midnight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZmxvcmlkYXBvbGl0aWNzLmNvbS9hcmNoaXZlcy81NzY4NTItZGlzbmV5LWlzLXN1aW5nLW92ZXItaXRzLXByb3BlcnR5LXRheC1hc3Nlc3NtZW50cy1hZ2Fpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney is suing over its property tax assessments — again - FILE,"Some things in this world are certain like death and Disney fighting its taxes.

Walt Disney Parks and Resorts recently filed a dozen lawsuits to appeal the 2022 property tax assessments done by the Orange County property appraiser.

It’s the second time this year Disney has turned to the courts to fight its tax bill. Disney which has contested its property assessments in court for years filed a series of lawsuits six months ago over the assessments for several resorts and administrative spaces.

In the newest round of Orange County lawsuits from this month Disney argued against the property appraiser’s methodology for the assessments at the four theme parks multiple resorts and some of Disney’s other buildings.

“The Appraiser failed to comply with … Florida Statutes and professionally accepted appraisal practices in assessing the Subject Property. … The Appraiser has included the value of certain intangible property in the Assessments” Disney said in court documents which didn’t provide details about what The Mouse claimed was done improperly.

In 2022 Epcot was assessed at about $521 million Hollywood Studios at $479 million the Magic Kingdom at $467 million and Animal Kingdom at $387 million according to court documents.

Disney said it has fully paid the 2022 tax bills as it fights the assessments. Disney submitted its tax bills which for the No. 1 park in the world the Magic Kingdom was $12.8 million if paid by Nov. 30. Epcot’s tax bill was $14.3 million.

For Disney theme parks 2022 was a banner year financially with then-company CEO Bob Chapek praising the record financial results last month before he was ousted a short time later. The Disney Parks Experiences and Products division reported $7.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter.

Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.

Orange County’s previous Property Appraiser Rick Singh had said Disney was historically undervalued.

“It’s a matter of being fair and equitable” Singh told the Associated Press in 2017. “If the single mother who is working two jobs has to be held accountable to pay her fair share so should everybody else.”

Singh who also dealt with well-publicized scandals in office was later voted out of office and Amy Mercado took over as the new Appraiser in 2021.

Mercado has shown a willingness to make deals with Disney.

Last year she reached a settlement with Disney that refunded the company about $9 million for the 2015-2020 tax bills for the four theme parks as well as several smaller properties including the Transportation and Ticket Center the Wedding Pavilion at Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa and Fantasia Fairways Miniature Golf Course.

Mercado’s office declined to comment Friday but she said last year “The whole purpose of our office regardless of who is in it is fair equitable and just values. It doesn’t matter who the owners are. What I believe we need to do is remove all the political noise that has occurred throughout the years and give everyone every property owner their fair shake.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkd2luZm8uY29tL3dhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkL2l0cy1hLXNhZC1kYXktd2hlbi1kaXNuZXktZ3Vlc3RzLW5lZWQtYW4tb2ZmaWNpYWwtcnVsZS1ub3QtdG8tZmlnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Disney's New Rule Says About Humanity,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.wdwinfo.com/walt-disney-world/its-a-sad-day-when-disney-guests-need-an-official-rule-not-to-fight/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkd2luZm8uY29tL3dhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkL2l0cy1hLXNhZC1kYXktd2hlbi1kaXNuZXktZ3Vlc3RzLW5lZWQtYW4tb2ZmaWNpYWwtcnVsZS1ub3QtdG8tZmlnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL2Jlc3QtZGlzbmV5LW1vdmllcy1mcm9tLXRoZS1kYXJrLWFnZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 Best Disney Films From the Dark Age (1970-1988) to Watch on Disney+,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL2Jlc3QtZGlzbmV5LW1vdmllcy1mcm9tLXRoZS1kYXJrLWFnZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd2R3bnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvcGhvdG9zLXdhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLW1hZ2ljYmFuZC1wbHVzLW1rL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Black Walt Disney World MagicBand+ Now Available,"A new MagicBand+ was spotted in the Frontier Trading Post featuring classic Walt Disney World symbols in an array of retro neon colors.

Discovery is exploring running ads in HBO originals like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""House of the Dragon"" on the HBO Max ad-supported tier in a reversal of its earlier streaming strategy.

HBO Max launched its ad-supported tier in June 2021 for $10 a month versus the streamer's $15 ad-free version. The cheaper service lacks features like the functionality to download content and see same-day release films. HBO Max capped ads at four minutes per hour limited how often users would see the same ad and said no ads would run on original HBO programming. Andy Forssell who was HBO Max EVP and GM at the time called the plan an effort to create an ""elegant tasteful ad experience that is respectful of great storytelling.""

Since then HBO Max parent WarnerMedia has been acquired by Discovery and under new CEO David Zaslav the merged entity Warner Bros. Discovery is racing to make streaming profitable and slash billions in debt. Executives are working on a plan to combine HBO Max with sibling Discovery+ into a new streaming service that is set to launch in the spring of 2023.

Ads running in HBO original shows and movies would be a controversial change to creators and people inside the company given how staunchly protective HBO is of its content.

Ad agency execs who have been briefed on the idea of ads in HBO content said they expected spots to start running on HBO Max soon and also to be part of the combined streamer. WBD has already been preparing for the new streamer by moving some Discovery+ content to HBO Max.

The spots would take the form of preroll ads at the beginning of current HBO originals and pre- and midroll ads in library content. The ad load would be in line with the current ad-supported HBO Max approach.

Some HBO originals have run with ads after they've been licensed to other distributors like ""Sex and the City"" on E!

But HBO originals weren't created with ads in mind so ads inserted in the middle of content could compromise the viewing experience and be controversial in Hollywood. When Netflix started running ads on the streamer top Hollywood creators like Shonda Rhimes expressed displeasure CNBC reported.

It's also unclear whether WBD will charge a premium for ads appearing in HBO originals — and if so how much. One option would be to upsell HBO originals as a separate offering as Hulu has done.

""There could be a premium associated with it because it's limited"" one advertising source said.

While some advertisers would leap at the chance to be associated with HBO's prestigious originals others wouldn't consider certain HBO originals suitable for their brands (think the Red Wedding scene on ""Game of Thrones"").

Advertisers who are already buying spots on HBO Max also might ask what the benefit is since they're already reaching the streamer's audience.

""For the right client it could be right"" another advertising source said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL2JsYWNrLWFkYW0tdGhlLXJvY2stdW5mb2xsb3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Adam 2 Seemingly Dead After The Rock Unfollows Warner Bros.

Licensed movies and shows of course get yanked from streaming services all the time. (See for instance NBCUniversal pulling The Office from Netflix onto Peacock.) But if a new show debuts on Netflix Disney+ or Amazon Prime you have been able to reasonably assume it will remain on those services for years to come.

This week however Warner Bros. Discovery indicated that the rule no longer applies to HBO Max as the company is pulling the once-buzzy drama Westworld from the service along with a few other original series. According to Variety the move will allow Warner to avoid paying residuals to cast and crew and is part of a broader effort by the company to turn a profit in streaming.

This could be just an isolated incident on Warner’s part. But with the entire streaming business becoming more cost-conscious it might also be the start of a trend in which streaming catalogs become a lot less stable.

What’s happening to Westworld?

Westworld isn’t the first original show that Warner has pulled from HBO Max. Earlier this year the company culled several other HBO shows from the service including Vinyl Camping and Mrs. Fletcher. It also removed some of HBO Max’s direct-to-streaming movies and canceled several others that hadn’t debuted yet most notably Batgirl.

Westworld is an especially high-profile example though and Warner might be pulling it for more than just tax write-off and residual reasons. Whereas those other shows have disappeared from the streaming realm entirely Deadline’s Nellie Andreeva reports that Westworld is likely to land on a forthcoming free ad-supported streaming service from Warner. Same goes for The Nevers another original drama that Warner is removing from HBO Max.

Don’t miss TechHive’s reviews of the best movies with a dark Christmas edge now streaming on Netflix Amazon Prime Video and elsewhere.

In other words pulling Westworld is at least partly about extracting more revenue from a show that may not have been driving enough HBO Max subscriptions. If prospective Westworld watchers don’t cancel but do spend time watching the show on an ad-supported service that makes it more profitable than it would have been on HBO Max alone.

Ad-supported streaming isn’t the only way in which Warner is looking to monetize its catalog outside of HBO Max. The company has discussed bringing new DC Comics-branded content to platforms other than HBO Max such as Amazon and executives have discussed “a more balanced approach to external licensing” which had largely ceased under Warner’s previous leadership.

All of which suggests that the old model of hoarding original shows on HBO Max is going away. If a show isn’t performing like it used to Warner may have no qualms about shopping it around.

Will more streaming services pull their originals?

We’re getting further into speculation territory here but as media companies face pressure to make their streaming businesses profitable I suspect Warner won’t be alone in loosening its grip on original programming.

Paramount has already taken some criticism from analysts this year for moving away from an “arms dealer” strategy and shifting more content onto Paramount+. In the entertainment industry an “arms dealer” produces original movies and TV shows and sells the rights to that content to the highest bidder rather than monetizing it through theatrical releases or its own online service. In a note to investors Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall wrote that Paramount+ will never scale up enough to be solidly profitable and that the company would make more money by selling more of its content to other distributors.

Meanwhile Sony has boasted of its own success as a streaming “arms dealer.” The company sold its stake in the streaming service Crackle several years ago and Sony has remained solidly profitable by selling its movies and shows to the highest bidders.

The money to be made on licensing must look somewhat attractive to companies like Netflix and Amazon and their legacy media competitors. These companies have spent billions of dollars building up vast original content catalogs over the years and a 2020 report from a former streaming executive concluded that Netflix would come out ahead by licensing some of that older content even if it lost some subscribers along the way.

While such a strategy might have seemed blasphemous a few years ago when every streamer was chasing growth at all costs streaming TV has since entered a bean-counting era in which companies are scrounging wherever they can for profitability. Compared to price hikes and password-sharing crackdowns licensing older original programming seems like a less risky way to make some money back.

What’s it mean for you?

Unless (or until) we see companies like Netflix and Amazon announce major licensing deals for older content I wouldn’t worry too much about any of this. But Warner’s latest moves underscore the need for better universal streaming guides so we can more easily find shows as they move between services. It’s also worth being aware of such tools as PlayOn and Channels DVR; they can help you maintain access to movies or shows even after they get pulled from the streaming services you subscribe to.

And of course be prepared for a fresh round of gripes from cord-cutting naysayers if more licensing becomes the norm. They howled when companies started hoarding content on their own streaming services so we should fully expect them to howl again if said content starts propagating back out.

He even had a cameo at the end of 'Black Adam'. But the folks at Warner Bros Discovery or more precisely the folks at newly christened DC Films called DC Studios thought it best to abandon Cavill. The reason for the recasting is that filmmaker James Gunn and producer Peter Safran are looking for a younger Superman in their burgeoning DC Universe. So Cavill who had already starred in a Superman origin story ('Man of Steel') had to go. However Gunn said on Twitter that he has left doors open for Cavill to explore opportunities in DCU which could be any other character to another alt-universe version of Superman.

Notably Cavill's cameo was made possible by Dwayne Johnson. Johnson starred as the titular character in 'Black Adam'. While the previous leadership agreed to it Gunn and Safran did not. An insider told The Hollywood Reporter that Cavill ""was a pawn in Dwayne’s failed attempt to control a piece of DC.""

Meanwhile a section of fans of Cavill is excited about the development. They want Cavill to be the next James Bond instead. Now that Cavill is free from a big franchise role he can now join another big franchise role of the fictional British superspy. After Daniel Craig left the role (with 2021's 'No Time to Die') a hunt for the next actor is on. While many names are being allegedly in consideration Henry Cavill is one name that crops up every now and then. And that was before he was confirmed to exit the Superman role.

Whether Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson the producers of the James Bond movies want Cavill or not fans certainly do.

One Cavill fan tweeted ""henry cavill should sign that james bond contract right about now.""

Another wrote ""But this means Henry Cavill can finally play James Bond right?""

Another tweeted ""Curious if the Broccolis wanted Henry Cavill for 007 but he had prior commitments said he'd think about it canceled those commitments and has freed himself up for the next 10 years to fully commit himself to that role. Witcher is fine Superman is nice but Bond is Bond."""
WM,Waste Management,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1sb2NhbG5ld3MuY29tL2hpL2hhd2FpaS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTIvMTUvd2hhdC1oYXBwZW5zLXRvLWhhd2FpaS1pc2xhbmQtcy10cmFzaC1hbmQtcmVjeWNsYWJsZXMtLdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What happens to Hawaii Island's trash and recyclables?,"This is the third part in a four-part series on trash and recycling with articles about Oahu Kauai Maui and Hawaii Island.

Hawaii Island residents and businesses created 203872 tons of waste in fiscal year 2022. A large amount of that trash went to the landfill.

However the County diverted about 50646 tons of that trash from the landfill. Most of the diverted waste was compostable green waste (36363 tons) and scrap metal (10098 tons). The rest included paper (2358 tons) plastics #1 and #2 (221 tons) glass (755 tons) and other materials.

Living on an island where the limited amount of space is always a concern there are big questions about the future of our landfills. By recycling we keep waste out of the landfill.

How recycling works

At recycling and transfer stations Hawaii Island residents may drop off cardboard and brown paper bags in one bin and small glass containers in another bin.

The County opens the recycling bins from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Check the days of the week that the recycling and transfer stations are open before heading out.

Take recyclables out of any bags before dropping them in the bins. Residents should flatten all corrugated cardboard before placing it in the cardboard and brown paper bags bin. Don’t bring cardboard contaminated with food or other residue like a pizza box.

The County does not accept any containers with the label HI5 in the small glass container bin but wine bottles liquor bottles jam and jelly jars baby food bottles pickle jars mason jars makeup containers and perfume bottles are all accepted. Clean and rinse these recyclables and remove all lids or caps. Labels do not need to be removed.

Business Services Hawaii which is contracted by the Hawaii County Department of Environmental Management collects the glass and crushes it to use in landscaping. The public can pick it up for free by reaching out to the Business Services Hawaii at (808) 966-7489.

In the scrap metal bins at select recycling and transfer stations residents may recycle small clean metal cans for soup pet food canned meat and vegetables. For more details about what other types of scrap metals may be accepted check individual location’s websites or call ahead.

The Hawaii Department of Health runs the HI5 program which exists on all the islands. The HI5 program allows for cans and bottles with the HI5 label to be exchanged for 5 cents. Beverage containers must be 2 liters or smaller and made of glass plastic or aluminum.

The 5-cent fee provides an incentive to bring the bottle container to a redemption center. Redemption centers are located throughout the island.

For more detailed information about how the HI5 program works read the first article in this series on waste and recycling.

On Dec. 1 2018 Hawaii County stopped accepting plastics with the #5 (polypropylene) plastic grocery bags and clamshell-type plastic containers. On Oct. 16 2019 the County stopped collecting the remaining plastics those with #1 and #2 on them. (However the HI5 program still collects plastics #1 and #2 on Hawaii Island.)

When asked why Hawaii County stopped accepting plastics Hawaii County Department of Environmental Management officials said in an email to Spectrum News Hawaii that “the market does not allow for recycled plastics” and that “there is no local outlet on the island who can benefit from plastic recycling.”

A collection of Hawaii County Department of Environmental Management officials provided information for this article including Director Ramzi Mansour Deputy Director Brenda Iokepa-Moses Acting Recycling Coordinator Craig Kawaguchi Recycling Specialist Chris Chin-Chance Solid Waste Division Chief Michael Rivera and Deputy Division Chief Michael Kaha.

Hawaii County’s decision to no longer accept plastics came after China limited the recyclable commodities it would accept and restricted the amount of contamination it would allow in the bales of plastic and mixed paper sent to the country.

After the types of recyclables that were accepted decreased in 2018 contamination in the drop-off recycling program increased.

“Contamination of recyclables and ‘wish-cycling’ of nonrecyclable materials are recurring issues with recycling. The County periodically runs campaigns to educate the public on proper recycling techniques” Hawaii County DEM officials said.

The recyclables collected at the drop-off bins are sold to foreign markets or the U.S. mainland. Corrugated cardboard is sold to Taiwan scrap metal is sold to Taiwan and other East Asia countries and as was mentioned earlier small glass containers are recycled on Hawaii Island.

In fiscal year 2022 it cost the county $456644 to recycle cardboard and $8183 to recycle small non-HI5 glass.

Instead of shipping recyclables to foreign markets the County could build a recycling plant.

Hawaii County has considered starting its own recycling plant to process recyclables according to the DEM officials. Budgetary constraints union concerns regulatory and permitting requirements and acquiring contracts to sell the recyclables were all listed as reasons that a recycling plant has not been built.

“The County will continue to consider the feasibility of all options” the DEM officials said.

Kristine Kubat is the executive director of Recycle Hawaii a Hawaii Island-based nonprofit that is developing infrastructure for recycling. She said it’s hard to promote recycling on Hawaii Island since the County accepts only a few recyclables. Her nonprofit hopes to create resource recovery parks where individuals who have cleaned and sorted their recyclables would bring them and they would accept more types of recyclables than the County.

The resource recovery parks would also be a place where people could bring a mattress to be reused or an appliance that wasn't working so it could get fixed. She said it would take the principles of a zero waste economy and put the value back into items by turning them into new commode or fixing them.

She described a resource recovery park as a fun clean place where residents would want to go with their family. There would be events at them like at a fair and people could only gain admission if they brought their recyclables.

“Humans have been resourceful for far longer than they've been wasteful” said Kubat. “This idea that we're just all a bunch of slovenly waste makers who can't be trained to do the right thing with something when we don't want it anymore is just wrong. And the challenge is to provide an opportunity that is enjoyable family oriented.”

Kubat said her nonprofit is currently working to fundraise for the project.

“We are working with the private sector right now to raise funding to establish resource recovery parks on Hawaii Island” said Kubat. “We're also looking at federal infrastructure funding.”

Green Waste

In a landfill green waste is buried and decomposes without oxygen which releases a large amount of methane. Instead of sending green waste to the landfill it can be turned into mulch and soil.

Hawaii County started its green waste diversion program in the mid-2000s. The County contracts with Hawaiian Earth Recycling to operate maintain and recycle green waste at the East Hawaii Organics Facility West Hawaii Organics Facility and the Kealakehe Mulch Public Pick-up Area at an annual cost of approximately $4.5 million.

Items accepted at the East Hawaii Organics Facility and the West Hawaii Organics Facility include palm fronds leaves trees shrubs bushes and hedge cuttings grass clippings untreated and unpainted wood pallets logs branches or other material less than 18 inches in diameter or 5 feet in length. At Transfer Station Collection Sites material must be 6 inches in diameter and 5 feet in length or less.

Items that are not accepted include garbage bags food waste from businesses farms or nonprofits lumber sawdust plastics rocks dirt glass metal treated or painted pallets and invasive species. Because of concerns about Rapid Ohia Death people should not bring any ohia plant material to green waste collection sites and should instead compost it on site.

Residents can drop off their green waste at the Hilo Keaau Kealakehe Keei Pahoa Volcano and Waimea Transfer Stations. Green waste that is dropped off at Hawaii County’s collection bins is hauled to the East Hawaii Organics Facility or West Hawaii Organics Facility to be processed into mulch. Residents can also drop green waste off directly at the East Hawaii Organics Facility or West Hawaii Organics Facility. For information about days and times the aforementioned locations are open click here.

In West Hawaii the green waste is ground into mulch and is left to dry. This mulch may be picked up for free at the Kealakehe Mulch Public Pick-up Area and the West Hawaii Organics Facility.

In East Hawaii the green waste is first ground into mulch and left to dry. It then undergoes a process where it must reach a temperature of 131 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 days to destroy harmful bacteria weed seeds and invasive species such as the little fire ant coqui frogs or Rapid Ohia Death. Once the mulch completes this process residents can pick it up for free at the East Hawaii Organics Facility.

For information about days and times the mulch pick-up locations are open click here.

Before recycling reduce and reuse

Hawaii County opened its first “Reuse Center” similar to a thrift store at the Keaau Transfer Station in 2003. Now Hilo Keaau Kealakehe Keauhou Laupahoehoe Pahoa Waimea and Waiohinu Transfer Stations have Reuse Centers.

“We need to reinforce the idea of reduce reuse recycle. Items such as clothes furniture toys latex paint and more that are gently used can be donated which makes needed items available to those who can’t afford to buy them new thus extending the life of usable items and keeping valuable resources out of the landfill. If the public has anything that is reusable they are welcome to bring them to these centers” the DEM officials said.

In 2007 the County Council passed a resolution to adopt zero waste goals. Hawaii County incorporated zero waste goals into the most recent version of the Integrated Solid Waste Management Plan which was approved in 2021.

The DEM officials said Hawaii County will reach its zero waste goals by recycling and diverting trash from the landfill using waste-to-energy technologies and supporting extended producer responsibility legislation.

Extended producer responsibility legislation requires manufactures to take responsibility for disposing of post-consumer products. For example Hawaii County said it supported the State Legislature’s passage of Act 151 which requires manufacturers of computers printers televisions and other electronic devices to provide free collection services for used products once a month. The manufacturers must then transport and dispose of the electronics.

In 2014 Hawaii County banned the use of plastic bags. The DEM officials acknowledged single-use plastic bags are only a small fraction of the waste created annually but said it was an important step in reducing waste and encouraging the public to switch to using reusable bags.

“Since the Plastic Bag Reduction Ordinance was implemented we received anecdotal reports that there is less wind-blown plastic bag litter. Another objective of the PBRO was to reduce the chance that wildlife would mistake plastic bag litter as food” the DEM officials said.

In 2017 Hawaii County passed the Polystyrene Foam Food Container & Food Service Ware Reduction Ordinance. With this ordinance the County prohibited food vendors from using polystyrene foam (often called “Styrofoam”) and they are required instead to use recyclable or compostable food service ware. There are some exceptions to the law: it doesn’t include straws cup lids utensils food-related bags and wrappers packaging for unprepared food pre-packaged items such as bread cookies milk juice snacks candy nuts and others and packaging for raw meat and eggs. Sashimi and poke are not exempt.

The DEM officials said the ordinance was aimed at reducing the amount of wind-blown polystyrene foam food container litter stopping wildlife from mistaking polystyrene containers for food and encouraging the public to consider reusable alternatives. Compostable food service wares reduce the amount of waste landfilled and instead biodegrade eventually becoming soil.

In order to reduce waste the DEM officials also encouraged businesses to design products to be more easily recyclable reusable or less toxic.

“After businesses have applied the strategies of reduction and reuse and they still have waste to be recycled they can contact local recycling companies to assist them with their recycling plans. Also businesses should be more cognizant of the products they import to the island that may create recycling challenges and become hazards for landfill material” the DEM officials said.

The future of the landfill

The West Hawaii Landfill will be full in about 20 years. Finding a location for the next landfill is a concern according to the DEM officials. They said it will be challenging to find a location for a future landfill because of stringent regulations and costs related to planning environmental regulations design and construction that will take many years to complete. It will also require community support.

Currently there isn’t a landfill that serves Hilo and the east side of Hawaii Island.

“At this time it’s under consideration” the DEM officials said about building a landfill to serve the east side of the island.

Oahu incinerates trash at H-POWER and turns it into electricity. (Read more about H-Power in the first article in this series.)

The DEM officials said Hawaii County is in discussion with the City and County of Honolulu and private entities in order to learn more about the possibility of building a waste-to-energy facility.

“The Solid Waste Division is exploring waste-to-energy options to generate fuel for transportation minimize its carbon footprint and mitigate climate change” the DEM officials said.

However JoAnn Yukimura who is the vice president of Zero Waste Kauai told Spectrum News Hawaii that waste-to-energy is not the answer because it requires always having a source of trash.

“The County of Hawaii over our objections has a waste-to-energy study going right now” said Yukimura. “It requires that we always have a source of trash and a good source of trash to make it economically feasible. For small populations like our neighbor islands it’s never feasible.”

“Our goal if we want a sustainable system is to reduce that stream of traffic to a trickle because we are reducing reusing or recycling” she added.

A simple ""wax worm"" may be the solution to helping us tackle plastic pollution a recent study has found. Published in the Nature Communications journal the research shows the saliva of these small everyday worms can break down materials commonly found in plastic bags and packaging.

What are wax worms?

Wax worms are the larvae (basically the caterpillar) of wax moths. They are known as feeder insects and their saliva features powerful enzymes that help them break down food.

How can wax worms help with plastic pollution?

Wax worms live in the honeycombs of beehives and eat wax made by bees. As researchers now know their saliva contains two enzymes that can break down polyethylene — the most commonly used plastic in the world — in just a few hours.

It's an exciting discovery in terms of tackling plastic pollution as these are the first known animal enzymes with the ability to actually degrade plastic. It could help introduce ""bio-recycling"" as a long-term solution to the Earth's massive plastic waste problem.

Federica Bertocchini one of the study's authors and an amateur beekeeper told the Guardian how the initial discovery came about as an accident in 2017.

""My beehives were plagued with wax worms so I started cleaning them putting the worms in a plastic bag"" Bertocchini said. ""I went back to the room where I had left the worms and I found that they were everywhere.""

Polyethylene makes up around 30% of all synthetic plastic production as it's meant to be a durable material used in packaging and in making bags. But that durability means it remains in the environment for a long time — often as long as 700 years.

""It eventually breaks down into small particles"" Bertocchini told Reuters. ""These particles have been found everywhere from Antarctica to rain and tap water which do not only cause obvious environmental issues but are a growing problem for human health.""

These findings may revolutionize plastic waste management on both small and large scales. As the enzymes don't require high temperatures or other extreme conditions to work wax worms may be used in the development of at-home kits which will allow people to recycle their own plastic waste.

Fernandez Arias one of the study's co-authors told Smithsonian Magazine that the research could be used in the future for ""limiting or eventually eliminating altogether the release of microplastics.""

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Countries that Produce the Most Plastic Waste.

India China and Philippines are among the countries that produce the most mismanaged plastic waste which is a significant problem in Asia in particular which accounts for 81% of the plastic waste that ends up in the ocean.

All of that waste has lead to the formation of the infamous Great Pacific Garbage Patch as much of that plastic is not biodegradable. At best it simply wears down into tinier and tinier pieces which causes its own issues as it’s then more likely to be ingested by fish and end up on our own dinner plates. It’s estimated that fish ingest as much as 24000 tons of plastic each year.

While Asia is a major contributor of plastic waste the issue of mismanaged plastic waste is a global one and regional statistics about mismanaged waste can often by skewed by developed countries exporting their waste to less developed ones where it’s often improperly disposed of.

Several companies are on the forefront of advancements in plastic production and waste disposal that offer some hope for a brighter less wasteful future. One of those companies is Danimer Scientific Inc. (NYSE:DNMR) which has developed a 100% biodegradable plastic that activist hedge fund Greenlight Capital and DNMR shareholder believes there will be enormous demand for according to its Q4 2021 investor letter. The fund raised its stake in Danimer by 135% in Q3 2022.

Before we begin the countdown of which countries produce the most plastic waste let’s dig into some of the most serious issues surrounding the matter. We asked OpenAI’s artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT for some of the most important questions on plastic waste and recorded those questions and its own answers below.

Question 1: What is mistreated plastic waste and how does it differ from other types of plastic waste?

ChatGPT’s Answer: Mistreated plastic waste is plastic waste that has not been properly managed or disposed of. This can include plastic waste that has been improperly stored transported or processed leading to damage or contamination. Mistreated plastic waste can pose a number of environmental and health risks as it can release harmful substances into the air water and soil and can also create litter and visual pollution.

Mistreated plastic waste differs from other types of plastic waste in that it has not been properly handled according to established protocols and guidelines. Properly treated plastic waste on the other hand has been managed and disposed of in a way that minimizes the risks it poses to the environment and human health. This can include recycling incineration or safe landfilling of plastic waste.

Story continues

Overall mistreated plastic waste is a significant environmental and health concern as it can contribute to pollution and waste accumulation and can have negative impacts on ecosystems and human health. It is important to properly manage and dispose of plastic waste in order to minimize these risks and protect the environment.

Question 2: What are the environmental impacts of mistreated plastic waste?

ChatGPT’s Answer: Mistreated plastic waste can have a number of negative environmental impacts. Some of these impacts include:

Pollution: Mistreated plastic waste can release harmful substances into the air water and soil leading to pollution. For example plastic waste that is improperly stored or transported can leach chemicals and other pollutants into the environment. Waste accumulation: Mistreated plastic waste can also contribute to waste accumulation as it may not be properly disposed of and may end up in landfills streets and other public spaces. This can lead to litter and visual pollution as well as pose a risk to wildlife and other organisms. Habitat destruction: Mistreated plastic waste can also contribute to habitat destruction as it can be ingested by wildlife and other organisms leading to injury or death. In addition plastic waste that ends up in waterways can entangle or suffocate aquatic organisms leading to habitat degradation. Climate change: The production and disposal of plastic waste can also contribute to climate change as it involves the use of fossil fuels and the release of greenhouse gases. Mistreated plastic waste can also release methane a potent greenhouse gas as it decomposes in landfills.

Question 3: How does mistreated plastic waste end up in the environment?

ChatGPT’s Answer: Mistreated plastic waste can end up in the environment in a number of ways. Some of the most common ways include:

Improper disposal: Mistreated plastic waste can be improperly disposed of either intentionally or accidentally. For example it may be thrown into the wrong bin or left in public spaces leading to litter and visual pollution. Poor waste management: Mistreated plastic waste can also result from poor waste management practices. This can include inadequate storage or transport of plastic waste leading to spills or leaks that can release harmful substances into the environment. Improper processing: Mistreated plastic waste can also result from improper processing such as burning or dumping plastic waste in an uncontrolled manner. This can release harmful substances into the air water and soil leading to pollution. Accidental release: Mistreated plastic waste can also end up in the environment through accidental release. This can include plastic waste that falls off ships or trucks during transport or that is lost or abandoned in the ocean.

Question 4: What are the health risks associated with mistreated plastic waste?

ChatGPT’s Answer: Mistreated plastic waste can pose a number of health risks to humans and other organisms. Some of the most significant health risks associated with mistreated plastic waste include:

Chemical exposure: Mistreated plastic waste can release harmful chemicals into the air water and soil leading to chemical exposure. This can include chemicals such as dioxins phthalates and bisphenol A which are known to be toxic to humans and other organisms. Infectious diseases: Mistreated plastic waste can also harbor infectious agents and pathogens leading to the transmission of diseases. For example plastic waste that ends up in waterways can be ingested by aquatic organisms which can then be consumed by humans leading to the transmission of diseases such as cholera and typhoid. Physical injuries: Mistreated plastic waste can also pose a physical hazard to humans and other organisms. For example plastic waste that ends up in waterways can entangle or suffocate aquatic organisms leading to injury or death. In addition plastic waste that ends up on land can pose a risk to wildlife and other animals as it can be ingested or cause physical injuries.

Question 5: How can we properly dispose of mistreated plastic waste?

ChatGPT’s Answer: There are several ways to properly dispose of mistreated plastic waste in order to minimize the risks it poses to the environment and human health. Some of the most common methods for disposing of mistreated plastic waste include:

Recycling: One of the most effective ways to dispose of mistreated plastic waste is to recycle it. This involves collecting and processing plastic waste so that it can be used to make new products. Recycling plastic waste can help to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and can also help to conserve natural resources. Incineration: Another option for disposing of mistreated plastic waste is to burn it in an incinerator. This process can help to reduce the volume of plastic waste and can also generate energy in the form of heat or electricity. However incineration can also release harmful substances into the air so it is important to carefully control and monitor the process. Landfilling: Landfilling is another option for disposing of mistreated plastic waste. In this process plastic waste is buried in a designated area and covered with soil. Landfilling can help to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in the environment but it can also release methane a potent greenhouse gas as the plastic waste decomposes.

Question 6: How can we reduce our reliance on plastic and prevent mistreated plastic waste from being produced in the first place?

ChatGPT’s Answer: There are several ways to reduce our reliance on plastic and prevent mistreated plastic waste from being produced in the first place:

Reduce plastic use: One way to reduce our reliance on plastic is to use less plastic in our daily lives. This can involve using reusable bags containers and water bottles instead of disposable plastic ones and choosing products that are made with less plastic or are made from more sustainable materials. Recycle: Recycling plastic can help to reduce the amount of plastic waste that is produced and can also help to conserve natural resources. By properly disposing of plastic waste and participating in recycling programs we can help to reduce the demand for new plastic and prevent plastic waste from ending up in landfills or the environment. Support businesses and organizations that are committed to sustainability: Supporting businesses and organizations that are committed to reducing plastic use and promoting sustainability can help to encourage the adoption of more sustainable practices and reduce the production of mistreated plastic waste. Educate others: Educating others about the environmental and health risks associated with plastic and the importance of proper plastic waste management can help to raise awareness and encourage individuals and communities to take action to reduce plastic use and prevent mistreated plastic waste.

Now that you have a better understanding of the dangers posed by mistreated plastic waste and the effect it has on climate change let’s check out the list of countries that produce the most plastic waste.

15 Countries that Produce the Most Plastic Waste

Our Methodology

The following data on mismanaged plastic waste per country is compiled from a 2021 study conducted by Meijer et al. which concluded that 1.5% of the world’s MPW ends up in the ocean within a year. Philippines and Malaysia were two of the worst offenders in that regard among the countries that produce the most plastic waste with nearly 9% of their MPW ending up in the ocean.

15 Countries that Produce the Most Plastic Waste

Disclaimer: The following write-ups are generated primarily by ChatGPT and not everything ChatGPT outputs is accurate so its responses have to be taken with a grain of salt. However for the most part it’s proven to be a powerful research tool. In some instances the responses have been edited for style and clarity or additional information has been added by the author.

15. Malaysia

Mismanaged Plastic Waste (MPW) Created in 2021 (in tons): 814454

MPW Created in 2016 (in tons): 2.06 million

Malaysia is one of the countries that produce the most plastic waste and has been a major destination for mistreated plastic waste in recent years with large quantities of plastic waste being illegally imported into the country. This has led to significant environmental and health concerns as well as a backlash from the Malaysian government and local communities.

Mistreated plastic waste in Malaysia often ends up in illegal landfills or is openly burned which can release harmful chemicals into the air and water. The country has also faced challenges in managing its own plastic waste with a lack of infrastructure and regulation leading to plastic waste being improperly disposed of.

The Malaysian government has taken steps to address this issue including implementing a ban on the import of plastic waste in 2019 and working to improve its waste management infrastructure. However the problem of mistreated plastic waste in Malaysia remains significant and will require continued efforts to address.

14. Indonesia

Mismanaged Plastic Waste (MPW) Created in 2021 (in tons): 824234

MPW Created in 2016 (in tons): 9.13 million

Indonesia has had one of the most impressive reductions in its mismanaged plastic waste creation among the countries that produce the most plastic waste. From generating 9.13 million tons of MPW in 2016 the country had lowered that figure to just 824234 tons in 2021 though that still ranked it 14th among the countries that produce the most plastic waste.

The country is the second-largest contributor to marine plastic pollution in the world and much of this plastic waste ends up in the country's rivers and oceans. One major contributor to the problem is the lack of a comprehensive waste management system in Indonesia. Many areas in the country do not have proper waste collection and disposal systems which leads to plastic waste being improperly disposed of and ending up in the environment. In addition the country has a large informal sector that often lacks the necessary infrastructure to properly manage waste.

13. Bangladesh

Mismanaged Plastic Waste (MPW) Created in 2021 (in tons): 1.02 million

MPW Created in 2016 (in tons): 764951

Bangladesh is a country located in South Asia that faces significant challenges with mismanaged plastic waste. Like many other countries Bangladesh lacks a comprehensive waste management system and this has contributed to the problem of plastic waste in the environment.

One major issue is the lack of proper waste collection and disposal infrastructure in Bangladesh. Many areas of the country do not have access to adequate waste collection and disposal services which leads to plastic waste being improperly disposed of and ending up in the environment.

There are also cultural and economic factors at play in Bangladesh's plastic waste problem. Single-use plastic products such as plastic bags and bottles are widely available and inexpensive which leads to high levels of consumption. In addition there is a lack of awareness about the environmental impacts of plastic waste and there are few incentives for individuals and businesses to reduce their plastic consumption.

12. Vietnam

Mismanaged Plastic Waste (MPW) Created in 2021 (in tons): 1.11 million

MPW Created in 2016 (in tons): 1.4 million

Vietnam is a country located in Southeast Asia that has a significant problem with mismanaged plastic waste. The country is a major contributor to marine plastic pollution and much of this plastic waste ends up in the country's rivers and oceans.

To address the problem of mismanaged plastic waste in Vietnam the government and other stakeholders will need to work together to implement effective waste management systems increase awareness about the environmental impacts of plastic waste and provide incentives for individuals and businesses to reduce their plastic consumption. This will require a combination of policy measures education campaigns and infrastructure investment.

11. Pakistan

Mismanaged Plastic Waste (MPW) Created in 2021 (in tons): 1.35 million

MPW Created in 2016 (in tons): 2.73 million

Pakistan is another country located in South Asia that has a significant problem with mismanaged plastic waste ranking as one of the countries that produce the most plastic waste. The country cut its MPW creation in half between 2016 and 2021 but is still a major contributor to marine plastic pollution with the United Nations ranking Pakistan as the seventh-largest contributor to marine plastic pollution in the world.

10. Thailand

Mismanaged Plastic Waste (MPW) Created in 2021 (in tons): 1.36 million

MPW Created in 2016 (in tons): 4.8 million

According to data from the United Nations Thailand is the eighth-largest contributor to marine plastic pollution in the world. Much of this plastic waste ends up in the country's rivers and oceans where it can have negative impacts on marine ecosystems and wildlife.

Thailand has taken a number of steps to address its plastic waste problem in recent years including implementing a ban on certain single-use plastics in 2021 such as plastic bags straws and utensils. The government has also encouraged businesses to switch to biodegradable plastics which can break down more easily in the environment.

9. Democratic Republic of the Congo

Mismanaged Plastic Waste (MPW) Created in 2021 (in tons): 1.37 million

MPW Created in 2016 (in tons): 1.08 million

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a country located in Central Africa that has a significant problem with mismanaged plastic waste. Like many other developing countries the DRC lacks a comprehensive waste management system and this has contributed to the problem of plastic waste in the environment.

Unlike several of the other countries that produce the most plastic waste on this list which have at the very least cut back on their MPW creation over the past five years Congo’s MPW generation has risen by 27% during that time.

8. Egypt

Mismanaged Plastic Waste (MPW) Created in 2021 (in tons): 1.44 million

MPW Created in 2016 (in tons): 3.04 million

Egypt is a country located in North Africa that produces a significant amount of mismanaged plastic waste which often ends up in the country's rivers and oceans where it can have negative impacts on marine ecosystems and wildlife. In addition plastic waste can cause water pollution and have negative impacts on the health of local communities.

The government has invested in the development of waste management infrastructure including recycling facilities and incineration plants to improve the country's ability to manage waste but more needs to be done to address Egypt's plastic waste problem.

7. Turkey

Mismanaged Plastic Waste (MPW) Created in 2021 (in tons): 1.66 million

MPW Created in 2016 (in tons): 959515

Turkey is another one of the countries that produce the most plastic waste which has actually increased its production of MPW in recent years rather than curtail. Among other things the country lacks a comprehensive waste management system which is contributing to its challenges in addressing the issue of how to handle a rising tide of plastic waste.

The Turkish government and other stakeholders will need to work together to implement effective waste management systems increase awareness about the environmental impacts of plastic waste and provide incentives for individuals and businesses to reduce their plastic consumption before the country can turn the corner on its plastic waste problem.

6. Tanzania

Mismanaged Plastic Waste (MPW) Created in 2021 (in tons): 1.72 million

MPW Created in 2016 (in tons): 814511

Closing out the first part of our countdown of the countries that produce the most plastic waste is Tanzania where mismanaged plastic waste has more than doubled since 2016. Many areas in the country do not have proper waste collection and disposal systems which leads to plastic waste being improperly disposed of and ending up in the environment. In addition the country has a large informal sector that often lacks the necessary infrastructure to properly manage waste.

The government has launched campaigns to encourage the use of reusable bags instead of single-use plastic bags and to educate the public about the environmental impacts of plastic waste encouraging individuals to reduce their plastic consumption. However it clearly must do more to address the challenges it’s facing as it rises higher on this list.

(Photo by Matthew Lloyd/Bloomberg via Getty Images)

“The project developer said all is good” says Kampol Wadnoi a village leader from Thalang in the west of Thailand about a 7.9MW waste-to-energy plant being built near his community. “No pollution. No problem! Because it is technology from abroad where they also do it.” The project was presented to him and other community members as modern and clean using an advanced Hitachi Zosen incinerator from Japan and reverse osmosis wastewater treatment technology from Germany – and yet waste-to-energy plants like these are facing pushback from local communities and environmentalists across South East Asia.

For decades waste-to-energy has been a key waste management tool in developed countries. Waste-to-energy plants are supposed to burn household and similar waste that could not be prevented or recycled (and ideally should not be landfilled). The incineration process produces energy which can take the form of electricity (to feed into the grid) hot water (for district heating or cooling) or steam (for industry). There are more than 1500 incinerators in Japan and countries like Germany Sweden and Denmark burn tens of millions of tonnes of municipal waste every year generating more than 10GW of electricity in Europe and 4.2GW in Japan.

Now they are looking to developing markets. There are dozens of waste-to-energy incineration plants planned or under construction across South East Asia using Japanese and European technology and framed as clean or renewable. However in Thailand and two other key markets Indonesia and the Philippines there is active pushback from local communities and environmentalists who fear that incineration could lead to increased pollution harm local communities and perpetuate the production of fossil fuel-based single-use plastics as fuel for the plant.

“Waste-to-energy projects have potential health and environmental risks if they are not governed properly but instead of having a strict monitoring regulation Thailand is helping investors to easily and quickly invest in these projects” says Supaporn Malailoy from EnLAW a Thailand-based environmental legal aid group. NGOs say waste-to-energy plants often burn waste that could have been recycled or composted produce toxic emissions and contribute to climate change.

Renewable and circular

The first modern incinerator in Japan opened in Osaka in the 1960s using European technology. In Europe a total of around 500 plants are in operation and approximately 40 new ones are planned or under construction almost half of them in the UK according to the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants.

However Janek Vähk climate energy and air pollution program coordinator with the non-profit Zero Waste Europe questions their necessity. ""The industry reports very clearly say that the European market is saturated"" says Vähk. The same is true in Japan where even the industry itself acknowledges there is little space for more waste-to-energy plants.

“Waste-to-energy plants are already built all over Japan and for now the majority of the demand will be replacement of old plants” says Yutaka Sugimoto a spokesperson with Hitachi Zosen. “Also in the long term the population of Japan is expected to decrease so the Japanese market is not expected to grow.”

Facing saturated home markets and increasing concerns about pollution and climate impact plus a growing push to reduce waste not burn it European and Japanese waste-to-energy providers are shifting their focus to South East Asia. This region is home to 600 million people and faces a growing waste management challenge – strikingly visualised via clogged up rivers and wildlife choking on plastic.

""Disseminating these [waste-to-energy] technologies worldwide has the potential to resolve critical waste management issues for the benefit of the environment and the society” said Patrick Clerens secretary-general of the business group European Suppliers of Waste-to-Energy Technology (ESWET) at the IRRC waste-to-energy congress in 2019 in Vienna Austria.

Government agencies like the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and multilateral financial institutions such as the Asian Development Bank support this by providing financial or capacity-building support to interested local governments who see waste-to-energy as a quick fix to a growing problem.

""Many countries in Asia are panicking about landfills” says Yobel Novian Putra an Indonesia-based campaigner with GAIA Asia-Pacific an environmental non-profit. “There is no space to build new landfills and [they are] trying to compensate for it by building incinerators.”

Energy Monitor identified several waste-to-energy projects in South East Asia receiving support from European government-backed aid agencies or using European technology. This includes a 36MW waste-to-energy plant in Cebu the Philippines which has support from Netherlands-based Amsterdam Waste Environmental Consultancy & Technology and a 19MW plant in Pangasinan also in the Philippines financed by UK-based Allied Project Services. In addition we identified a Danish government-backed project for a 15–17MW plant in Semarang Indonesia and an 8.7MW project in Chonburi Thailand backed by French companies Engie and Suez Environment.

Groups like ESWET emphasise that waste-to-energy should only use waste that cannot be recycled – and would otherwise be landfilled – so framing the technology as part of a circular economy. Others argue that waste-to-energy is in fact a renewable energy technology that can play a role in helping regions like South East Asia transition away from fossil fuels.

""Waste to energy… is renewable energy generation"" says Sugimoto adding that landfills are a major source of methane a potent greenhouse gas. ""Our technology can solve those issues reduce pollution and contribute to power generation.""

In South East Asia Japan may be even more active than Europe with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs JICA and the Kitakyushu International Techno-cooperative Association all working to promote incineration. Projects in cities like Davao and Cebu in the Philippines and Bandung and Surabaya in Indonesia will use technology from major Japanese companies including Hitachi Zosen but also Marubeni JFE Engineering and Itochu.

South East Asia's massive waste-to-energy expansion plans

According to data collected by Energy Monitor there are more than 100 waste-to-energy projects recently constructed being built or planned across three major South East Asian markets – Indonesia the Philippines and Thailand.

There are 13 projects in the Philippines six of which are already operating with a combined installed capacity of 9.69MW. There is opposition from environmental groups to these projects. However local governments promote waste-to-energy incinerators as a ""long-term solution"" to their solid waste problem and technology providers are entering into agreements with local governments often with no bidding procedure according to Miriam Azurin at GAIA-Philippines.

“They push all this messaging to legitimise the technology and they also frame this as a solution for sustainable cities along with the [UN] Sustainable Development Goals frameworks"" says Azurin.

The most developed project is in the city of Davao where a Japanese government-funded waste-to-energy plant is currently under construction. Residents say they were poorly consulted about the project. Meanwhile in Cebu which has plans for a 36MW project garbage collectors who earn as little as 5000 Philippine pesos ($90) per month working seven days a week have little to no idea about their community’s solid waste management plans or the impact this might have on their livelihoods.

In Indonesia there are 17 proposed projects with a total capacity of at least 134.9MW. However one planned for the neighbourhood of Tebet in Jakarta has been postponed after opposition from local community members and environmentalists.

""There is a potential for dioxin discharge from burning garbage"" explains Muhammad ""Anca"" Aminullah a campaigner with WALHI Jakarta an environmental NGO that led the campaign against this project. “This will worsen Jakarta's current air quality which is already poor.” He adds: ""[We are also concerned about] odours and [noise and congestion from] the garbage trucks because the proposed location [for the incinerator] is only about 20m from residential areas.""

A 12MW project under construction in Surakarta Central Java with support from an Austrian company is also facing growing grassroots pressure. ""The danger of air pollution from waste treatment in the form of fly ash and bottom ash will pollute humans and cause cancer"" says Fahmi Bastian the executive director of WALHI Central Java. ""The quantity and quality of the surrounding water will also be disturbed because the incinerator will use groundwater.""

There are 79 waste-to-energy projects adding up to a generation capacity of around 600MW planned for Thailand. The one in Thalang has received attention due to mounting opposition to it. The local community does not feel it has been properly consulted. “If they intend to carry out a good project  why have they done everything in such a fishy manner?” says Chaloa Suwanachart a headman of the Thalang subdistrict leading opposition to the project.

For example the project’s initial public hearing was held at a military base located several kilometres from the community and was filled with representatives who were not from the community. When Suwanachart pointed this out he was sued for defamation by WPGE Phetchaburi Company (WPP) the Thai company leading the project for 150 million baht ($3.94m) along with a journalist who reported the issue.

However the actions of Suwanachart and others have had an impact: the incinerator is not yet operational and there is no timetable for it to start up. WPP declined an interview request in September 2022. It said there are still “some small steps"" to be taken before switching on the plant.

Missing green credentials

One major concern about the expansion of waste-to-energy in South East Asia is how very different waste streams could impact plants' sustainability and operational efficiency. In developed economies like Europe and Japan organic waste such as food only makes up 10–20% of municipal waste. Moreover long-standing and well-organised waste segregation systems allow Japan to limit the amount of non-burnable waste such as electronics metals and chemicals that end up in incinerators making them efficient and clean.

""The characteristics of Jakarta's waste are not suitable for waste-to-energy"" says Muhammad from WALHI Jakarta. ""The waste is mixed and wet and not well sorted.""

This is a common problem. In South East Asia according to GAIA Asia-Pacific organic waste can make up as much as 50% of municipal waste and there are limited formal systems for waste segregation. To reach the high temperatures that incinerators need to function effectively GAIA Asia-Pacific believes it is likely that waste-to-energy plants in South East Asia will require fuel beyond municipal waste streams. Most likely this will be plastic.

According to a report released in 2019 from the Center for International Environmental Law if incineration expands globally by 2050 global emissions from plastic incineration will increase to 309 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent.

Plastic is important due to its high combustibility. In order to operate incinerators have to burn at high temperatures. For South East Asia the high levels of organic waste may mean higher demand for plastic to feed incinerators.

This leads non-profits to worry that the long life spans of incinerators will lock in demand for plastic as well as the combustion of waste and its emissions for decades. In Japan this has made work with communities to reduce plastic waste and implement a circular economy more difficult says Akira Sakano founder of the non-profit Zero Waste Japan.

""We have already invested in incineration so there is no point for the government to invest in new facilities to promote recycling"" explains Sakano. ""We need plastics production to keep incinerating so there is no incentive to invest in plastic recycling.""

Japan has an effective system for recycling PET bottles but nearly all other plastics end up in incinerators. In fact Japan classifies waste that ends up being burned as ""thermal recycling."" Incineration accounts for as much as 60 percentage points of the stated 84% national plastic recycling rate.

Even proponents of incineration acknowledge that reducing emissions from waste-to-energy will be crucial for Japan to meet its 2050 climate neutrality goal; incineration currently makes up 3.2% of Japan's total greenhouse gas emissions or 31 million tonnes of CO2 a year.

""If we want to reach a carbon neutral society we may have to reduce waste-to-energy"" says Takaoka Masaki a professor and chair of the Waste-to-Energy Research Council at Kyoto University in Japan. ""Because at present the main source of CO2 from waste is [burning] plastic [in waste-to-energy plants].” (Incinerators produce more CO2 per unit of electricity than landfills but the latter do produce methane a stronger greenhouse gas.)

Factor it all in and waste-to-energy is potentially worse than using fossil fuels to generate power argues Vähk; its dependence on plastic means it will always be a high-emissions energy source. ""The energy produced by incinerators is at least 1.5 or two times more greenhouse gas-intensive than for example [burning natural] gas” said Vähk. ""It is the most climate-impacting way of producing energy if you have a lot of plastics in there.""

Industry proponents counter that when life cycle emissions and waste inputs are taken into account waste-to-energy is partly renewable. They also point to pilot projects in Copenhagen and Oslo that use carbon capture and storage (CCS) which they argue can make the technology carbon neutral or even carbon negative in future.

However in South East Asia no waste-to-energy projects are proposing CCS. This leads some to conclude that for this region waste-to-energy is harmful not only to communities but also to the region's climate and energy goals. ""Oil companies are looking for a new market plastic” says Yobel from GAIA Asia-Pacific. ""Asia is a new market for plastic and we are burning it.

""Incineration is not part of our climate solution. When people learn about the science that incineration is dirtier than a coal plant they feel this needs to be stopped.”

But Ecuadorians Have Yet to See a ...,"Steven Donziger is back in his airy mid-century modern apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan engaged over Zoom on a marketing call with a representative of the online publishing platform Substack.

Back and forth they wrestle with a complicated question—who is Steven Donziger—and quickly realize there is no easy answer.

Donziger is a crusading lawyer who led a team that won one of the world’s largest pollution judgments against Chevron on behalf of Indigenous peoples and other residents of the Ecuadorian Amazon in 2011.

He’s also wearing an ankle bracelet having spent the morning checking in at a Bronx halfway house for federal inmates. Connecting those dots is a fraught tale.

The $9.5 billion award he helped secure from an Ecuadorian court covered horrific pollution from oil production by Texaco (acquired by Chevron in 2001) that poisoned the rainforest with oil spills and billions of gallons of toxic wastewater.

But none of Donziger’s original 30000 Ecuadorian clients—suffering and dying from cancers and other diseases that many believe are related to the oil contamination—have received a penny since the original lawsuit was filed in 1993. Nothing.

Here’s what happened.

Three years after the Ecuadorian court ruled on their behalf a U.S. federal district judge in New York found in a countersuit brought by Chevron that Donziger’s team had obtained the Ecuadorian judgment through fraud bribery and extortion.

Among other things Donziger was accused in the countersuit of forging an expert’s signature blackmailing a judge facilitating the ghostwriting of a key piece of evidence and bribing other Ecuadorian judges—acts that Donziger either denies or says were not illegal in Ecuador.

He has criticized the ruling in the U.S. lawsuit which Chevron filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) as a “Manhattan trial judge purporting to overrule Ecuador’s Supreme Court on questions of Ecuadorian law.” Donziger was referring to one of two appellate court decisions in Ecuador that affirmed the $9.5 billion judgment.

Still the RICO lawsuit along with a similar decision from an international arbitration tribunal has so far made the $9.5 billion Ecuadorian judgment unenforceable despite attempts by plaintiffs to collect damages in Canada Argentina and Brazil among the many countries where Chevron has assets.

The ankle bracelet Donziger is wearing stems from Chevron’s attempts to recoup costs and legal fees in the RICO case after the company prevailed.

During the Zoom call with a female Substack representative Donziger’s prison-issued phone rings as he and the woman game out a “tagline” for his forthcoming account with the platform. “This happens multiple times a day” he says of the noise. “It’s crazy.”

Between 2018 and 2019 Donziger refused to turn over his computer and other electronic devices in the fight with Chevron over legal fees and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York declined to prosecute him for contempt of court citing a lack of resources.

The judge who ruled against him in the RICO case then took the highly unusual step in 2019 of appointing a private prosecutor to pursue criminal contempt of court charges for Donziger’s failure to turn over his personal devices. In that separate contempt of court case Donziger was placed on pretrial house arrest.

And then last fall after three more years of litigation a second federal judge in New York found Donziger guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to six months in prison of which he served about a month in a low-security federal prison in Connecticut and the rest on house arrest. On this afternoon in April there are about two weeks left in his sentence.

Donziger tells the Substack representative that he needs to monetize his writing because he’s been disbarred. “I’m a disbarred attorney not a discredited one—quite the opposite” he says defiantly.

Together they go on brainstorming about how to market his column—in other words why should people pay to read what he has to say? It’s a question Donziger has thought a lot about on the cusp of his release.

“So I would say that there’s the Ecuador case” Donziger says. “And then there’s like the lawyer who is probing issues at the intersection of climate human rights and the law. That to me is how to frame it. That’s a pretty good tagline. OK? Climate human rights and the law.”

He’s always been gifted at selling his causes and the wheels in his head are clearly turning. In real time he seems to be working out who he is and who he wants to be.

“Donziger on justice” he says finally satisfied that he’s reached the right conclusion. “Because of the fact that I fought for justice for 28 years for the people of Ecuador against Chevron.”

In Ecuador Plaintiffs With ‘Nothing’

Almost 3000 miles away in the Ecuadorian Amazon Emergildo Criollo speeds up the Aguarico River in a long motorized canoe. The Indigenous Cofán are known as water people and the canoe is their signature vessel. Criollo maneuvers the canoe in an eddy and hops out barefoot walking about 100 yards through a forested area to his two-room wooden aqua-blue home where five of his grandchildren are playing inside.

He believes Texaco’s oil exploration caused the deaths of two of his children and his wife’s uterine cancer by polluting their water. Criollo became involved in the lawsuit brought by Donziger and others in 1993 when he was a young man and went on to become one of the most visible plaintiffs. He appeared alongside Donziger in the 2009 documentary film Crude and was featured in Paul Barrett’s 2014 book about the case Law of the Jungle.

There is a weariness to Criollo now in his 60s as he remembers the day he lost his second child who accidentally swallowed oil-contaminated water while swimming. He’s told the story to many journalists over the last two decades. None of their articles and books have delivered justice for Criollo’s children. Neither have three decades of litigation spanning at least six countries at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars in legal expenditures and attorney fees.

“I’ve fought for 22 years on this case I have nothing to show for it” he says as one of his grandsons wearing a Spider-Man top crawls into his lap.

In the back of Criollo’s house is a large rainwater reclamation tank part of a project initiated by a nonprofit organization to provide communities in the area with safe drinking water now that their traditional sources of water—streams and rivers—are not safe to drink. Criollo said his community needs more reclamation tanks but lacks the money to purchase them.

“Today everything requires money” he says.

Criollo explains that Texaco’s oil exploration transformed the Cofán’s culture in ways that continue to draw many away from the traditional life they knew before the company arrived in the 1960s.

His family had lived upstream on the Aguarico River near the settler town of Lago Agrio about 180 miles east of Quito the Ecuadorian capital. In addition to the Cofán at least four other Indigenous peoples had been living in the region’s lush jungle for hundreds of years. Their ancestral history was culturally entwined with and dependent on the region’s near-pristine waters and mega-rich biodiversity.

After Texaco struck oil here in the late 1960s the company along with American missionaries and the Ecuadorian government carried out a policy to colonize the region and expel Indigenous peoples from their lands.

Forced onto smaller and smaller plots of land the region’s original inhabitants watched black crude and toxic drilling waste pollute their waters kill their animals and taint their food. This history was investigated and documented by the lawyer Judith Kimerling in her 1991 book Amazon Crude hailed by The New York Times as the “Silent Spring of Ecuador.” Now a professor emertius at The City University of New York Kimerling lives a few miles from Donziger in Manhattan.

In her groundbreaking book Kimerling wrote that from 1964 to 1990 Texaco dumped 3.2 million gallons of toxic “produced” water from oil operations and flared nearly 50 million cubic feet of noxious methane gas per day while spilling 17 million gallons of crude in the rainforest.

Texaco used virtually no environmental controls or monitoring Kimerling found despite regulations in the United States prohibiting such conduct. Her research inspired Donziger and other lawyers to file the original 1993 lawsuit. Yet she declined to be a part of their litigation team having doubts about the ethics of the lawyers behind the case after different Indigenous groups approached her asking how the lawyers could claim to represent them without their consent and how they could solve their problems without talking to them. She continues working with Indigenous communities trying to defend the forest from oil extraction in Ecuador to this day.

Shortly after the 1993 lawsuit was filed in U.S. federal court Texaco began settlement negotiations with the Ecuadorian government to end any liability it had for the pollution. By 1998 with the litigation continuing Texaco completed what it said was a $40 million cleanup. Yet independent reviewers of the corporation’s remediation report including the Louisiana-based chemist Wilma Subra said the cleanup was “cosmetic.” Still Ecuador without consulting Criollo or any of the other people affected fully released the company from further legal liability in a series of settlement agreements. The settlement agreements did not release the claims of third parties like Criollo. Kimerling criticized the settlement agreements and how the cleanup was carried out describing it as more like “an agreement between two polluters” to limit their liability than a serious clean up.

In August I visited some of Texaco’s remediated drilling sites that were not subsequently operated by PetroEcuador its local partner and eventual successor or by other oil companies. At first glance the sites looked unremarkably like other swaths of jungle in the area. But where the company’s former waste pits were located vast quantities of oil-like material had risen to the surface commingling with soil and rainwater.

Pools of water had a sheen from oil residue and chunks of oil-blackened soil had the viscosity of children’s Play-Doh laced with remnants of crude and emitting the stench of burnt rubber. Subra who has written U.S. oil industry regulations told me that it was entirely possible that waste from Texaco’s operations could still be traveling through aquatic systems in the region along with pollution from other oil companies contaminating plants animals and people with heavy metals radioactive material and other toxic materials including dioxin and benzene.

Beyond the pollution and displacement Criollo describes other ways in which expanding oil operations have affected the Cofán. The degraded and shrinking forest no longer able to fully provide for the community’s food and medical needs forced the Cofán out of self-sufficiency and into the market economy. The shift has opened a generational divide between older Cofán who want to protect the forest at all costs and younger leaders who are more open to negotiating with oil companies in exchange for payments that support Cofán families he said.

“What I’d like for my grandchildren—there’s a possibility that we can purchase more land and reforest it” Criollo said. “It’s hard for me to imagine my grandchildren anywhere but here in the forest. The question is where will we get the money to buy land?” He made no mention of the uncollected $9.5 billion Ecuadorian court judgment awarded to him and thousands of other plaintiffs.

To a Bronx Halfway House

Before his strategy session with Substack on Zoom Donziger paces around his apartment sipping from a giant plastic cup of iced tea. He is scheduled to check in at a halfway house in the Bronx at 2 p.m. but he’s spent the past hour talking on his cellphone with one of his assistants dictating tweets to his 196000 Twitter followers about the outrages of his confinement.

“Both of my judges had ties to Chevron” he says referring to the U.S. judges who presided over the RICO and criminal contempt cases. “Re-tweet that. People forget that.”

For Donziger social media has been a crucial tool in a war of words with Chevron over who the villain is in this long-running courtroom battle. Each side has crafted its own narrative by emphasizing different facts and using their respective megaphones including competing websites to push those narratives out.

Early on Chevron pounded its legal defenses: Yes the pollution was real but the company had done what it was supposed to do. It had negotiated settlement and release agreements with Ecuador and conducted the required cleanup. If Donziger’s clients had injuries from pollution it was the government of Ecuador and other oil companies they should be suing.

But once Chevron unearthed evidence of apparent misconduct by the attorney’s team the company began to claim that it was the real victim and that Donziger cast as a money-hungry plaintiffs’ lawyer was engaged in a shakedown. In a flash the dispute became all about him.

In a lengthy emailed statement about this article Randy Mastro an attorney representing Chevron said that Donziger had carried out a “longstanding corrupt campaign against Chevron” that he “is not a ‘human rights lawyer’ and that his attempt to hitch his wagon to climate change is a new invention as he tries to follow the media and the money.”

For his part Donziger says everything he did was aimed at helping grievously harmed clients obtain some type of compensation from one of the world’s most powerful corporations—one he contends that has benefited from a global legal system designed to protect it.

Early on in the litigation Donziger took out an advertisement in The New York Times warning Chevron investors that “Texaco comes with a lot of assets and one huge liability.” He helped broker friendly media coverage of his team like a Vanity Fair feature on the Ecuadorian lawyer Pablo Fajardo.

To help win public opinion Donziger commissioned the documentary filmmaker Joe Berlinger to follow his team of lawyers for the making of “Crude.” That decision ultimately led to Chevron’s RICO lawsuit after the company noticed that an early version of the film included a scene in which Donziger’s team privately met with a supposedly independent court-appointed expert.

Chevron invoked that scene in persuading American judges to force Berlinger Donziger’s team and others to turn over film outtakes and internal documents about the case. In one of the outtakes Donziger declares: “’The only language that I believe this judge is going to understand is one of pressure intimidation and humiliation.”

Once the RICO lawsuit was filed in 2011 Donziger shifted his attention to combating what he calls a “coordinated attempt to destroy him” by Chevron and a contingent of the federal judiciary.

He argued that the judge presiding over Chevron’s RICO lawsuit Lewis A. Kaplan showed a disdain for him and an affinity for Chevron throughout the proceedings. At one point Kaplan remarked that Chevron was a “company of considerable importance to our economy.” In a separate action before the RICO lawsuit Kaplan having reviewed some of the Crude outtakes suggested that “Donziger’s own words raise substantial questions as to his possible criminal liability and amenability to professional discipline.”

Donziger has also worked to focus attention on Kaplan’s appointment of a private prosecutor to pursue the contempt of court charges pointing out that the prosecutor worked for a law firm that had in the past represented Chevron. The contempt conviction was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York and a request for Supreme Court review of the case is pending. Donziger has called the situation a “private corporate prosecution.”

A report spearheaded by a former U.S. ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice found that the contempt proceedings violated international human rights laws and that there was “a reasonable appearance of bias” on the part of Judge Kaplan in appointing the prosecutor in the case. The report concluded that the contempt proceedings violated Donziger’s fair trial rights and that his detention was arbitrary.

Donziger has amassed a following of supporters including Bianca Jagger Sting and Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters. Other celebrities drop by his apartment to show their support.

U.S. Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and other members of Congress have written to President Joe Biden requesting a pardon for Donziger. The Guardian newspaper in London asked Donziger to write a regular column. He receives donations from people around the world to cover his living expenses and personal legal fees and another panel of international jurists has condemned Donziger’s nearly three-year detention. (In addition to his six-month contempt sentence Donziger spent nearly two and a half years in pretrial detention on house arrest because of delays linked to the Covid pandemic and continuance requests by his legal team.)

As Donziger walks into the Bronx halfway house there is a slight swagger to his step. He insists that he is winning: “Hugely successful” he says. In and out of the brownstone within 30 minutes he walks the quarter-mile to 188 Cuchifritos his favorite local Peruvian chicken joint. He knows he is expected to go straight home to Manhattan after his mandatory check-ins but he reasons it’s just a quick visit.

Standing at the counter Donzgier leans towards the waitress and in Spanish orders a half roast chicken rice and beans then towering over everyone else in the restaurant at 6 foot 4 watches her prepare his order.

“Eso es un poco pequeño no? [That’s a little small?]” he asks her with a serious face pointing to the piece of chicken on the plate.

The waitress substitutes a larger piece for the chicken and Donziger makes his way to the nearest table where he rips into his meal sucking the meat off the bones before discarding what’s left in a pile on his plate.

When he finishes he pops into a small store next door that sells fresh seafood marveling at how much less expensive fish is in the Bronx than on the Upper West Side. He leaves without buying anything and starts walking toward the subway station stopping to give a few dollars to a man who approaches him asking for money.

Rebel at Harvard Law

The son of a businessman and a schoolteacher Donzgier grew up in a well-to-do suburb of Jacksonville Florida. Early on his mother nurtured a sense of social responsibility in her son taking him to his first rally at a Winn-Dixie grocery store on behalf of farmworkers.

His parents divorced when he was 15 and Donziger became particularly close to his maternal grandfather Aaron E. Koota a former justice of the New York State Supreme Court and a Brooklyn district attorney known as a “tough crime fighter” with a fondness for media attention.

Donziger’s interest in Latin America began with a solo trip to Mexico during a summer break in college. He spent about a month hitchhiking around the country working odd jobs and learning Spanish. A Russian studies major at American University who wrote for the school newspaper Donziger graduated wanting to become a foreign correspondent.

At 23 he took off for Estelí Nicaragua to cover the war between the country’s leftist Sandinista government and the right-wing Contras backed by Ronald Reagan’s administration. Donziger said the experience particularly the U.S. role in the war opened his eyes to the way “government authorities and other forms of entrenched power” can abuse the law and people to get what they want.

At 28 he moved back to the United States with plans to apply to law school. He worked briefly in Atlanta with a legal aid society advocating on behalf of the Cubans incarcerated in the U.S. who had come to America en masse in the 1980 Mariel boatlift.

Then he was off to Harvard Law School where he jostled on the basketball court with a fellow student named Barack Obama and helped organize a 1991 trip to Iraq with a small group of classmates to document civilian casualties during the Persian Gulf War.

Donziger led the law-student contingent and acted as its spokesman. For the first time he had begun to merge his two interests law and the media. That approach would persist as a signature tactic throughout his career.

After his 1991 graduation from Harvard Donziger worked briefly as a public defender in Washington representing juvenile defendants before joining up with one of his former classmates John Bonifaz and his father Cristobol Bonifaz to file the 1993 lawsuit against Texaco in U.S. federal court in New York.

In 2002 Texaco succeeded in having the lawsuit dismissed on the ground that Ecuador was a more appropriate forum for the litigation to take place—a key turning point in the saga and an outcome lambasted by critics for among other things overlooking the fact that the important decisions about Texaco’s operations in Ecuador had been made from its headquarters in White Plains New York.

Donzgier who had been a junior member of the legal team representing the Ecuadorian plaintiffs in New York worked with a new team of lawyers to refile the lawsuit against Chevron in Lago Agrio the next year. Eventually he would ascend to the leadership of the team that won the $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in 2011.



A Sacrifice Zone

Silvia Yanez spent the first years of her young marriage traveling 17 hours by foot and bus every eight days from the Ecuadorian town of Coca to Quito to receive treatment for Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. She too became one of the 30000 individuals Donziger represented in the litigation against Texaco and Chevron.

Dressed in black and pink yoga pants with matching bright pink toenails Yanez now 34 tells her story while sitting on a sofa in her living room. Around her six small dogs and a new kitten vie for her attention.

Newly pregnant when she was diagnosed in 2006 Yanez was faced with a decision: keep the baby and delay treatment for eight months or terminate the pregnancy and receive chemotherapy that would effectively end her ability to have children. Too ill to decide for herself she left the decision to her family which chose the latter option in the belief that it was unlikely that either Yanez or the baby would survive if she tried to carry the child to term. The family scraped together funding for her chemo treatments by selling portions of their land and other possessions to save her life.

Yanez’s voice catches when she shares that she can no longer have children because of the chemotherapy. Her eyes well up as she looks down at the brown shag rug beneath her feet. Around the living room are five large stuffed animals and a collection of small figurines including a tiny childlike angel with its hands clasped in prayer.

Yanez’s story is not unique to Orellana and Sucumbíos Provinces in the Ecuadorian Amazon region. Despite having cancer rates higher than Ecuador as a whole the area has no oncology center. Women make up the majority of cases about 72 percen0 which researchers link to their washing clothing and other household goods in contaminated river water.

The two major cities here Coca and Lago Agrio have an abundance of infrastructure created by and for the oil industry. Instead of sidewalks pipelines line the roads in most places. At nighttime the orange-yellow glow of more than 400 gas flares lights up the sky. The best-paying jobs in town are with PetroEcuador—both Yanez’s husband and mother who is in remission from uterine cancer work for the state-run oil company.

The area is emblematic of the term “sacrifice zone” used by environmental and health advocates to describe parts of the world sacrificed to pollution so that people elsewhere can benefit from oil mineral or other types of production.

Now in remission Yanez works for the Union of People Affected by Texaco or UDAPT a nonprofit organization that represents people affected by oil contamination in the area. Yanez helps sick people make medical appointments arranges transportation for them counsels patients on day-to-day tasks and registers those with documented cancer cases as part of an ongoing research study carried out with the Swiss nongovernmental organization Centrale Sanitaire Suisse Romande and the Ecuadorian health organization Clínica Ambiental. The study began in 2018 after years of unanswered requests for such an accounting by the government.

With few doctors a dispersed population and a high number of rural poor simply counting the number of sick people here has its challenges. On a recent workday Yanez rode nearly an hour on the back of a colleague’s motorbike to visit a prostate cancer patient in palliative care. The man who lives alone in a modest wooden home has been unable to afford his prescribed medication.

Yanez performs reflexology a form of acupressure on his feet to help alleviate his pain. She also counsels his daughter on how she could raise money to help pay for his treatments; they settled on trying to sell homemade tamales in town.

‘Buen Vivir’

About a two-hour drive northwest from Yanez’s house in a small village called San Pablo de Kantesiya Simon Lusitande 70 ambles down a wooden staircase outside his home wearing the traditional clothing of the Siekopai peoples and navy blue crocs. He lowers his lean body onto a small red plastic chair beneath a corrugated tin roof.

Lusitande was also one of Donziger’s clients. Behind his home the Aguarico River audibly gushes through an area of dense rainforest that has belonged to Lusitande’s ancestors for centuries. From generation to generation the Siekopai have passed down knowledge both sacred and pragmatic about the rainforest through lines of shamans including Lusitande.

He understands the healing powers of hundreds of different types of plants as well as the rhythms of the forest. Those teachings long sustained a life of what he described as “buen vivir” which roughly translates into good living in balance with nature.

The Siekopai’s descriptions of buen vivir are backed up by anthropological studies showing that before Texaco’s arrival in the region in the 1960s the Indigenous peoples here had access to plentiful amounts of food and more leisure time than most in the modern Western world.

Lusitande who has childhood memories of that life said that after Texaco began operating in and around the Siekopai’s traditional territory the locals began contracting illnesses that their traditional medicine couldn’t treat.

To pay for Western medicine and associated travel costs some of the Siekopai have taken to growing palm oil trees and logging in San Pablo de Kantesiya. Like crude oil an international thirst for palm oil an additive to consumer products from body lotions to pizza dough has changed things here. Just outside the village palm oil plantations have overtaken swaths of what once was biodiverse forest belonging to the Siekopai.

Together with emissions from gas flares the Aguarico and other rivers and streams have transported pollution from oil operations onto the Siekopai’s land contaminating crops and other plants.

Lusitande said he has two main concerns: He wants someone to clean up the contamination from oil extraction and he wants medical assistance for his people.

Specifically he wants a nearby hospital where people with cancer and other diseases he attributes to the contamination can receive treatment. In 2018 Lusitande lost his wife after a multiyear battle with uterine cancer. She had to discontinue her chemotherapy treatments when the family could no longer afford the drugs and the onerous costs of travel to and from Quito.

According to data from the Swiss study death rates from cancer in this area are higher than the average of Ecuador as a whole in part because of the hardships associated with the costs and difficulties traveling to Quito for treatment.“It’s difficult so difficult” Lusitande says.

His son Nicolas joins him wearing a soft blue long-sleeved shirt and dark blue jeans. Side by side the father and son are the spitting image of each other though 26 years apart in age. Nicolas placed his hand on his father’s shoulder.

“Young people say to me ‘Abuelo (grandfather) you started this fight but you started it a long time ago and we haven’t seen the results’” Lusitande says. “Where’s the money?”

“Nobody listens to us” Nicolas says flatly. “We are at God’s mercy here.”

‘Free Donziger’

When the day of Donziger’s “Freedom Block Party” finally arrives in late April a crowd of about 100 gathers outside his apartment building to celebrate “Steven Donziger’s Release After 993 Days of Illegal Detention” as the event was described on social media.

Wearing a blue button-down oxford shirt that is half tucked in a black blazer and jeans Donziger takes to a makeshift stage under a bright blue spring sky to address the crowd and a livestream audience. “Neither myself nor my family could have done this without the support of each and every one of you and also the support of thousands maybe millions of people around the world” he tells the audience.

To his right a “Free Donziger Chevron Lies” banner hangs along construction scaffolding. Behind the stage are Chris Smalls the labor organizer known for rallying Amazon workers; the actress Susan Sarandon and members of Donziger’s legal team among others.

“It is so much bigger than me” Donziger says. “It is so much bigger. They attacked me to try to intimidate all of us and our whole society into not taking on the industry that is literally destroying our planet” he adds pointing at the crowd to indicate that Chevron had attacked them too. “That was the purpose of my detention.”

The crowd erupts into applause and cheers. Donziger is ebullient. He loves being in front of a crowd and feeling the energy. When he mentions that the federal judge who oversaw his criminal contempt case Loretta A. Preska is a member of the Federalist Society a conservative legal organization those cheers turn into loud boos. “Chevron’s a major funder of the Federalist Society” Donziger says as the boos grow louder and his grin widens.

He passes the microphone around to Smalls some of his lawyers and others. When it is Sarandon’s turn to speak the actress accuses the mainstream media of “a complete blackout” of coverage of Donziger’s case.

“Like everyone else when I heard this story I just couldn’t believe it” Sarandon says with a beaming Donziger behind her right shoulder. “I kept thinking there must be something I don’t know to explain this miscarrage of justice.”

Some lawyers who have closely tracked the litigation take a different view. Kimerling the lawyer whose work inspired the litigation in the first place has been critical of just about everyone involved in the dispute: Donziger Chevron the Ecuadorian government the American judiciary and the international legal system—all of which she argues have in their own way failed the people affected by Texaco’s operations.

Kimerling said that Chevron produced evidence of misconduct by Donziger and his team and that has made the Ecuadorian $9.5 billion judgment vulnerable. She believes that the team claimed to represent all of the affected people without getting their consent and listening to them and at times rebuffed efforts by affected communities who wanted to participate in decisions about their claims. “The oil frontier continues to expand environmental conditions are worsening people’s rights are still being violated and no one is taking responsibility” she says.

Robert Percival a professor of environmental law at the University of Maryland uses the legal dispute as a cautionary tale in his courses. He has called Texaco’s Ecuador operations “reprehensible” and accuses Chevron of “scorched earth” legal tactics in its litigation. And Donziger he says sank his clients’ case by among other things inviting a film crew to document the legal team’s internal deliberations.

Still both Percival and Kimerling say Donziger was treated unfairly by the American courts in the contempt proceedings.

As the sky overhead darkens and the street event winds down. Donziger takes the microphone back for one last word. He reminds people to support his quest for a presidential pardon and to sign up at his website freedonziger.com.

“We’re not going to change that by the way because I’m not fully free” he says referring to his website domain name. “We’re moving on to a new phase. It’s about going on offense and trying to make this company comply with the rule of law and pay the judgments that it owes to the people it poisoned in Ecuador.”

A Sort of Detente

On a backstreet in the town of Sushifindi in Sucumbíos Province Pablo Fajardo sits in his ground-floor law office typing out arguments on his laptop. Behind him hangs a framed photograph of an Indigenous man standing before a large banner on which the words “Justicia” and “Chevron” are visible.

As a young man Fajardo was part of the legal team that won the $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron and like Donziger he was named in the company’s RICO lawsuit. In his 497-page opinion Judge Kaplan found that Fajardo was involved in bribing the Ecuadorian judges and ghostwriting their opinion. Fajardo maintains that the team never engaged in illegal conduct and has accused the American judicial system of “looking down its nose” at Ecuador.

He has continued to practice law out of his Sushifindi office but after the RICO lawsuit had a falling out with Donziger in part over questions about the way litigation funding was spent—Donziger had raised millions of dollars to fund the lawsuits against Texaco and Chevron.

In 2017 the UDAPT organization represented by Fajardo accused Donziger of misappropriating some of that funding and declared him a persona non grata. Fajardo said his clients are the owners of the $9.5 billion judgment and entitled to know how the litigation funding was spent.

Donziger has denied the allegations and said he made a full accounting to his client the Amazon Defense Front an organization that he claims owns the $9.5 billion awarded by the court.

Donziger in turn has struck out at Fajardo accusing him of mishandling an opportunity to collect part of the judgment in 2016.

Donzgier’s grievances encompass two additional legal disputes related to Chevron’s operations in Ecuador that most likely will result in what would in the plaintiffs’ minds be the ultimate injustice: Chevron whose predecessor Texaco polluted the Ecuadorian Amazon walking away with hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in damages paid by the Ecuadorian government. If and when this happens it would also represent perhaps the last chance for the plaintiffs to receive at least a portion of the original $9.5 billion judgment by going after the damages paid by Ecuador—in Ecuador—to Chevron which years ago removed all of its other assets from the country.

The damages Ecuador is soon likely to have to pay to Chevron will come under a 1993 bilateral trade agreement between the United States and Ecuador that gives U.S. investors like Chevron certain protections covering their investments in Ecuador. Among those protections is the right to “fair and equitable treatment” by the Ecuadorian government. The agreement also gives foreign investors the right to institute legal proceedings against the Ecuadorian government before an international panel of arbitrators if those protections are not honored.

Using this arbitration system on a parallel track to the RICO case it brought against Donziger and others Chevron filed two cases against the government of Ecuador. The first filed in 2006 related to a commercial contract dispute over the amount of oil Ecuador claimed it needed for domestic consumption and the second filed in 2009 related to whether the Ecuadorian government treated Chevron unfairly during the lawsuit brought by Donziger’s team.

In its first arbitration against the Ecuadorian government on grounds that Ecuador breached its commercial contract with the company Chevron won a $96 million award in 2011 that by 2016 had with interest grown to $112 million.

This award Donziger believes gave plaintiffs like Yanez Criollo and Lusitande a $112 million asset in the country that they could fight to claim.

Ecuador’s president at the time Rafael Correa went to Fajardo who was then counsel of the Amazon Defense Front and asked him if his clients would waive their right to collect the funds—if the money went to them and Ecuador therefore failed to pay Chevron the government could lose access to desperately needed international funding.

Fajardo said he consulted with his clients about the request and they directed him to waive their claim on the $112 million allowing the government to pay Chevron. Donziger furious at the missed opportunity claimed that Fajardo unilaterally released the embargo giving up the chance to collect part of the $9.5 billion judgment. The Amazon Defense Front fired Fajardo over the dispute.

Chevron’s second arbitration case against Ecuador has caused even more controversy precisely because the company may walk away from the pollution dispute with another multi-million or billion dollar payment.

In 2018 three international arbitrators ruled in Chevron’s favor and against the government of Ecuador. In a 521-page opinion they found that the $9.5 billion judgment was “procured through fraud bribery and corruption and was based on claims that had been already settled and released by the Republic of Ecuador years earlier.” The evidence they cited was similar to the purported misconduct that Judge Kaplan outlined in reaching his conclusion in the U.S. RICO case.

The arbitrators’ ruling also said that the Lago Agrio judgment “should not be recognised or enforced by the courts of other states” making it difficult for the people of the Ecuadorian Amazon to lay claim to assets Chevron has in other countries.

Critics of the ruling including Fajardo argue among other objections that the arbitration unfairly excluded his clients from formal participation in the proceedings even though their right to enforce the $9.5 billion judgment was affected by the outcome.

The arbitration tribunal is now assessing the damages owed to Chevron in the second award. This potentially gives UDAPT or the Amazon Defense Front—depending on which has the rights to the $9.5 billion—another opportunity to lay claim to the damages payment to Chevron.

In recent weeks Fajardo has reached a sort of detente with Donziger with the two agreeing not to attack each other in view of the larger goal of trying to enforce the judgment. Fajardo said he has plans in the works for a new legal effort to claim the $9.5 billion for UDAPT but offered no time frame.

Harvard Law Redux

Late one afternoon last month Donziger dropped in virtually on a “Justice for Lawyers” seminar at Harvard Law School taught by Professor Charles Nesson a member of the legal team that represented Donziger in his New York disbarment proceedings.

Thirty years earlier Donziger sat in a similar classroom. On this night appearing via Zoom he says that if someone had told him back then where he would end up he wouldn’t have believed it. It has been a difficult journey he tells the class but “it turned out better than I thought because after all this time I have a much larger platform and I think I’m getting a lot of support I never had before because people looking at the situation realize what really happened.”

Nesson has called the RICO judgment by Judge Kaplan a “constructed lie” built on what he contends is faulty evidence such as the testimony of a controversial witness the former Ecuadorian judge Alberto Guerra. Guerra’s testimony was a basis for Kaplan’s finding that Donziger bribed Guerra and another judge to secure the Ecuadorian ruling.

Chevron disclosed that ahead of the RICO trial it had paid to relocate Guerra and his family to the United States and had also been giving them money each month to cover their housing and other living expenses.

In testimony before Kaplan Guerra admitted accepting payments from Donziger’s team and working with those lawyers to ghostwrite orders for the Ecuadorian judge who issued the $9.5 billion judgment. Later he repudiated parts of his testimony though not his account that Donziger offered him money to ghostwrite the judgment. Donziger vehemently denies offering such a bribe or participating in the ghostwriting of the judgment.

Nesson contends that Chevron did not prove that Donziger either bribed the Ecuadorian judges or ghostwrote the judgment.

“This idea of ghost writing … if they had proved it is a matter of a lawyer offering assistance in the form of some kind of documents that help a judge write the opinion” Nesson told me in an interview. “There is no law against it and it does not prove that the judge was bribed.”

In the Harvard classroom the professor’s students ask Donziger about the potential legacy of his litigation with Chevron. Donziger says he believes that more lawyers should be trained not just in the law but in how to carry out advocacy campaigns using the media social media and working with politicians to counter the disproportionate power corporations have over plaintiffs in some cases.

“Chevron went to the U.S. government we went to the U.S. government” he tells the students. “They wanted to take out paid ads to trash us; we got free media by holding press conferences. They think they’ll control the narrative; we worked with a documentary filmmaker.”

Donziger isn’t alone in touting his unconventional style. Sarah Leah Whitson a human rights lawyer and former Harvard classmate of the embattled lawyer praised him as brilliant and said “If Steven wasn’t Steven with all his flaws and all of his shortcomings which like any other human he has we wouldn’t have had litigation against Chevron.”

Graham Erion a former lawyer on Donziger’s team said that once the case was moved from the U.S. to Ecuador Donziger was forced to do battle in a context unlike any U.S. court case: “Both sides were in a constant battle” he said adding “I think U.S. courts mainly Kaplan came along and created this horrified impression of how the litigation played out in Ecuador and that’s unfair.”

Whether or not Donziger’s behavior in Ecuador was justified—what Kaplan derided as a “Robin Hood” defense—the Harvard students are intrigued by his story. One of the students asks him about his plans for the future.

He’s writing a book Donziger tells them and is in talks with a studio about a film that would tell his side of the story. And despite the ongoing legal issues stemming from his contempt proceedings he says he is hopeful.

“So I’m feeling pretty good” he says. “I’m not going to say it’s perfect because you know it never really is. But if you get the right perspective and you realize what we’ve accomplished I’m just really proud of everyone who’s worked on this.”

“I’m surprised at myself—I really didn’t ever know I would have the strength and resilience that I’ve had” Donziger adds. “I’m just pleased with myself. You know I’m proud of myself.”

Tami Stuart gained her angel wings on December 17 2022 after a long and courageous battle with a brain tumor. She was a caring and devoted wife mother grandma daughter sister and friend.

Tami was born to Wayne and Carol Weiher on March 6 1959. She graduated from McMinnville High School in 1977. After high school she continued living in McMinnville while working for her father at the Sheridan Dairy Queen. In 1980 she met her husband Kent Stuart. They were married on October 9 1982 and had three children.

Tami was a full-time mother until she began her career in banking after her youngest child reached school age. She worked for First Interstate in McMinnville which later became Wells Fargo. Tami left Wells Fargo with a team of co-workers in 1999 and together they became the inaugural crew at Citizens Bank in McMinnville. She was a customer favorite at the drive-up window.

Tami was known as the most dedicated sports mom proudly cheering from the stands at every game. In addition to her children’s sporting events she loved BINGO nights with friends and Can-Am rides with her husband. Her greatest joy came in 2011 when she became a grandma her proudest role ever. She spent her remaining years devoted to her grandchildren. Her love joy and laughter will be forever missed.

Tami was preceded in death by her father Wayne Weiher. She is survived by her mother Carol Weiher; her beloved husband Kent Stuart; daughters Kelsey Robinson (Nick) and Tara Gray (Matthew); son Shane Stuart (Lauren); brothers Scott (Teresa) and Steve Weiher; and eight grandchildren Caleb Kael Caiden Jaxson EveLynne Kent Isaiah and Elianna.

Finding the right one for you will likely have a profound impact on your financial future. Luckily these experts are here to help.

Edited by John Bruno Turiano and Nick Brandi

We didn’t need World Population Review to tell us that Westchester is one of the richest communities in the U.S. Yet as of this year that same demographics research company placed nine Westchester County towns among the top 100 richest towns in America — more than any other county in the U.S. With all that accumulated wealth it follows that Westchester would attract some of the most experienced and talented wealth advisors to be found anywhere. But isolating the best of the best is no mean feat so WM hired data-research company DataJoe to conduct an exhaustive multitiered survey to determine and document the county’s top 314 wealth managers.

From the November/December 2022 Issue

New treatments advanced medical devices and innovations in everything from human health to animal health are driving growth in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The biotech and pharma sectors continue to thrive as an aging population seeks prevention and treatment for a wide variety of issues new diseases change scientists’ focus and governments and private entities invest in research and development of new solutions.

According to a new report “The U.S. Bioscience Industry: Fostering Innovation and Driving America’s Economy Forward” the nation’s bioscience industry employed 2.1 million people across more than 127000 U.S. business establishments in 2021. The report from the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) and the Council of State Bioscience Associations (CSBA) in partnership with the research firm TEConomy also noted that the biosciences industry increased employment by 11% since 2018 while jobs in the overall economy decreased 1.5%. The October report also indicated that the bioscience industry’s economic impact on the U.S. economy amounted to $2.9 trillion dollars in 2021 as measured by overall output.

The pharmaceutical industry is also thriving. Research and Markets reports that the global pharmaceutical industry is expected to grow to $1.25 trillion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.8%. North America accounted for 46% of the market in 2020. Meanwhile the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) noted that the industry’s manufacturing footprint in the U.S. is extensive with more than 1500 facilities across 47 states and Puerto Rico currently manufacturing FDA-approved medicines and related products and employing nearly 120000 manufacturing workers in high-wage jobs.

Here are some regions that are attracting pharma and biotech companies.

Conroe Texas: Business-Friendly Boomtown

Located 40 miles north of Houston along I-45 Conroe is one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States. It was recently identified as the No. 1 “boomtown” in Texas and No. 3 in the nation by financial technology company SmartAsset. Conroe has seen its population swell by 26% to nearly 100000 over the past five years a remarkable surge even for Texas.

“Conroe is in the path of growth from Houston” says Mayor Jody Czajkoski. “This community will be the northern anchor of what will be the Houston-Conroe Metroplex. Conroe is the only city left that has land to grow.”

With abundant and affordable housing and safe streets Conroe is a family-friendly city with a burgeoning music and restaurant scene. With 157 miles of shoreline majestic Lake Conroe juts into Sam Houston National Forest a natural buffer to the north.

Talent is readily available with an expanding workforce of 1.8 million potential employees within a 40-mile radius. Conroe’s dynamic and diversifying economy is attracting robust investments in advanced manufacturing energy services logistics retail and—increasingly—top-flight industries such as healthcare and biotechnology.

For manufacturers Conroe boasts easy interstate access and proximity to the bustling Port Houston. For executives Conroe-North Houston Regional Airport offers its own customs facility a rare asset that smooths out the wrinkles of international business travel.

Targeted investments in infrastructure that helped to produce an enviable public school system also yielded two premium industrial parks one of which has an on-site community college. Totaling nearly 2000 acres Conroe Park North and the newer Deison Technology Park are crucial pillars of the city’s economic development strategy.

“We’ve got all the infrastructure in place” says Conroe Economic Development Council executive director Danielle Scheiner. “We’ve got our industrial parks and the airport. We have a strong manufacturing base that partners well with the corporate base in The Woodlands our neighbor to the south. You can have your corporate headquarters in The Woodlands your manufacturing plant here in Conroe and park your corporate aircraft at our airport.”

As Conroe Park North’s largest employer medical device manufacturer Steris produces more than 100 endoscopic products and employs more than 600 people in administration R&D and product manufacturing.

“The great thing about Conroe is that we’re on the north side of Houston which is the growth side” says Bruce Stoltzfus vice president of operations for Steris. “We have very very beneficial access to high-tech talent manufacturing talent and engineering talent. It’s a great technology area great for growth of life sciences. Every time we’ve expanded they’ve been very helpful with permitting and really everything else we need.”

Recently celebrating its grand opening as the initial tenant at the 248-acre Deison Technology Park VGXI is a contract manufacturer of plasmid DNA a key component in coronavirus vaccines. “We are a small but growing company” says COO Dorothy Peterson. “Deison Technology Park is the perfect fit for us. We love that the land in the park is designed to be a technology community.”

Delaware: Talent Government Access and Innovation ecosystem

Delaware’s location midway between New York City and Washington DC places it at the center of the largest U.S. consumer market and provides proximity to major airports seaports rail lines and highways. The state also has one of the nation’s three most favorable tax climates and lowest costs of doing business. These attributes are just part of what makes Delaware an advantageous location for biopharmaceutical companies.

Delaware ranks 9th on the Milken Institute Science & Tech Index 8th on Bloomberg’s Most Innovative States list 5th on WalletHub’s Most Innovative Environment list and 1st for most patents per capita. Delaware also is among the top three recipients per capita of National Institutes of Health Institutional Development Award funding and ranks 3rd in R&D inputs 7th in life sciences venture capital funding per capita and 7th in R&D spending per capita.

Global leaders like Incyte which was founded in Wilmington in 2002 and opened a 200000-square-foot research facility there this year as well as fast-growing innovators like Prelude Therapeutics and earlier-stage operations like Uvax Bio are thriving. A 190-acre campus for major CRDMO WuXi STA is underway. A rich scientific heritage begun by DuPont combines with world-class talent accessible elected officials and a networked innovation ecosystem to propel biopharma forward.

One of every six U.S. pharmaceutical industry employees and nearly 30% of all U.S. biochemists and biophysicists work in the Delaware region and the local concentration of R&D biotech workers is 1.5 times the U.S. average. Delaware also has the highest concentration of chemical engineers of any state and the fourth-highest concentration of employed PhDs in health science and engineering.

The regional talent pool created by more than 100 educational institutions includes University of Delaware (UD) and its chemical engineering program—ranked #2 nationally by U.S. News & World Report. Life sciences degrees awarded in Delaware grew by 64% since 2010 and feeding the bio workforce pipeline with UD through in-state degree training and continuing education programs are Delaware State University Wilmington University Delaware Technical Community College and the state Department of Education.

Government support of Delaware biopharma includes a generous research and development tax credit and strong legislation to protect intellectual property. It also includes a multimillion-dollar Delaware Graduated Lab Space Grant Fund and a Delaware General Assembly Life Sciences Caucus.

“The biopharmaceutical industry is part of Delaware’s DNA” says Governor John Carney. “Ensuring Delaware is a top-tier global hub of life sciences research and innovation is essential to both public health and our economic future and we will continue to invest in its long-term growth.”

Delaware’s innovation community also bolsters itself. UD’s Science Technology and Research (STAR) Campus DuPont Experimental Station Delaware Technology Park and Chestnut Run Innovation & Science Park offer collaborative environments that further advancements and commercialization.

The atmospheric floodgates have swung open and allowed bitterly cold air to spill south over the western half of Canada especially the Prairies. A piece of the polar vortex will bring in exceptionally cold air over the region with temperatures diving into the -30s and even -40s.

There is also the potential for Northern Canada to see its first -50°C-reading in eight years which is a sign of how potent this looming cold snap truly is.

DON'T MISS: Could a frigid lead-up to Christmas leave Canada coated in snow?

Make sure you are properly dressed if going outside for any amount of time which should be limited because of the health risks associated with exposure. The Arctic front will yield potentially dangerous cold temperatures in Western Canada for the next several days.

STAY SAFE: Understanding the warning signs of frostbite

Daytime highs will struggle to climb out of the -20s for much of Alberta and Saskatchewan throughout this week. Extreme cold warnings are in place for several regions.

The coldest temperatures are expected by mid-week when folks could endure temperatures dipping below -30°C. It's likely overnight lows will hit -40°C or below outside of urban areas. Any winds will make temperatures feel even colder.

Communities in the valleys of northern Yukon including Dawson and Mayo could see temperatures drop to or below -50°C this week. This would be the first reading of -50°C or colder in Canada since February 2014 when Eureka Nunavut hit -50.4°C."

Ebby Halliday Companies comprises Ebby Halliday Realtors Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate and Williams Trew.

And while financials are typically an impressive enough yardstick on their own the Ebby Halliday Companies brands rise to the top in several other categories as well. That is to say they are No. 1 in more ways than one.

Ebby Halliday represented the seller of this significant Old Preston Hollow estate property one of the largest sales of the year.

History

78 years of Ebby Halliday Realtors. It’s an achievement few companies live to tell about. The climb has been methodical and steady throughout that time and continues despite downturns and economic uncertainty. In fact in 2022 they acquired three established brokerages – two in East Texas and one west of Fort Worth – and were able to do so because of that heritage and reputation.

History was made when a young and determined Ebby Halliday transitioned from selling hats to selling houses.



Innovation

A best-in-class real estate experience would not be complete without the inclusion of end-to-end transaction services. When you work with any Ebby Halliday Companies brand – Ebby Halliday Realtors Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate or Williams Trew – you also gain access to in-house mortgage title and insurance teams creating an even more convenient and seamless process for you. It’s just one of the many ways the Ebby Halliday Companies put people first.

Ebby Halliday was part of the very first North Texas MLS transaction – talk about innovation!



Reach

This is a big one. Starting locally no other company has boots-on-the-ground agents in so many markets – but the real secret sauce is that EHC agents are connected with a collaborative spirit of cooperation. EHC agents have fellow colleagues (many would even go as far as to say almost like family members) who know every inch of North and East Texas as well as parts of Oklahoma. It’s these connections that when leveraged can make a difference for clients especially in a market like our current one. Because of EHC’s affiliation with HomeServices of America (a Berkshire Hathaway company) they are part of a nationwide network of brokerages that includes 850 offices and 43000 sales associates in 30 states. They also are founding members of Leading Real Estate Companies of the World and its luxury division Luxury Portfolio International. This worldwide network of companies and agents comprises 550 brokerages in 70 countries. In other words the properties they represent are promoted through these networks to a national and international audience – a big win for listing clients. On the buy side the company benefits from referrals made by fellow members of these invitation-only networks to help any clients who are moving to the North and East Texas markets.

Education

Ask any longtime agent where they spent the early years of their career and they’ll most likely tell you Ebby Halliday Realtors. Many have gone on to great success both with the brand and elsewhere but it was the training and continuing education they received through Ebby that gave them a solid foundation on which to build. EHC’s EDGE and Coaching programs are renowned for providing more than is industry-required and every office is well-stocked with mentors.

Graduates of the most recent EHC Coaching Program celebrate on the final day of the six-week class.



Support/Resources

Signing on with an EHC brand gives associates immediate access to game-changing tools that can elevate a personal brand. Drag-and-drop point-and-click – whatever the method the process couldn’t be easier for creating social media and print content that stands out. And should a custom approach be required there’s a 14-person Marketing Department and an IT Support Team standing ready to jump in as needed.

The Triple 7 expedition has a goal of raising $7 million for Folds of Honor a nonprofit group that provides scholarships to families of fallen or disabled military members and first responders. If the goal is reached the project will fund 1400 scholarships.

“If we really break it down … if we just think about a million people giving $7 we’ll reach our goal” Fred Williams said earlier this month when several team members sat down with KTAR News 92.3 FM’s The Mike Broomhead Show.

Williams a former Navy Seal and CEO of Complete Parachute Solutions in Coolidge Arizona is leading the jump team.

Legacy Expeditions the veteran-owned company behind Triple 7 held multiple training camps at Williams’ Pinal County facility this year totaling nearly 800 jumps.

The team members plan to convene in at Union Glacier Camp in Antarctica and wait for a weather break in the first week of January to perform the first jump of the mission.

The expedition then plans to move through Punta Arenas in Chile Cape Town in South Africa Perth in Australia Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and Barcelona in Spain before completing the mission in Tampa Florida.

Dan Myrick who co-wrote and co-directed “The Blair Witch Project” is leading the documentary crew filming Triple 7.

“They’re real people with real stories and I really want to bring it out in the film” Myrick said.

Alex Kunz co-founder of nutritional supplement company Frog Fuel is part of the expedition’s medical/wellness support team.

“I’m very passionate about things like this because we’re in a room of individuals that are successful in transition and now I feel it’s like an obligation or responsibility of ours to help others be successful as well” Kunz said.

Those were some of the songs that played in the background when Americans decorated trees baked cookies and wrapped presents.

Holiday classic:‘Christmas Wrapping’ an unlikely hit for The Waitresses spreads cheer 40 years later

“Great Songs of Christmas” a premium record produced annually for Akron’s Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. in the 1960s and 1970s holds a tender place in the hearts of many baby boomers and Gen Xers.

Featuring “the greatest artists of our time” the compilation albums were sold exclusively at Goodyear stores and dealers across the country.

The records were the brainstorm of New York marketing consultant Stanley Arnold whose corporate clients besides Goodyear included Ford Standard Oil United Air Lines American Tobacco Macy’s and General Foods.

“Santa Claus never used a tire but it occurred to me that Christmas had two deep connections with Goodyear” Arnold wrote in his 1967 memoir “Tale of the Blue Horse and Other Million Dollar Adventures.”

“First everyone is interested in Christmas; second Goodyear sells many many tires during the pre-Christmas season. That would be the million dollar idea for Goodyear I decided: an album of Christmas music.”

Goodyear executives liked the idea of having a premium unrelated to tires because it might introduce the company’s products to new customers.

As Goodyear advertising director John P. Kelley explained: “There are millions of people who have never been inside a Goodyear store not exactly sure where it is located don’t know exactly what we sell don’t know what price levels at which we sell things and don’t know that we have auto service. We want to get those people in there.”

The company signed a deal with Columbia Special Products a division of Columbia Records to produce a 33⅓ rpm long-play hi-fidelity record.

It had a retail value of $3.98 but Goodyear sold it for only $1.

What was on first record?

Released in 1961 the first album was a compilation of previously recorded songs from the Columbia archives:

SIDE ONE

“Silent Night” by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. “O Little Town of Bethlehem” by Eileen Farrell and the Luther Henderson Orchestra. “O Come All Ye Faithful” and “Jesu Bambino” by Perry Faith & Orchestra. “What Child Is This (Greensleeves)” by Mitch Miller & Gang. “O Holy Night” by Earl Wrightson and the Andre Kostelanetz Orchestra. “For Unto Us a Child Is Born” by Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic.

SIDE TWO

“Ring Christmas Bells” “The First Noel” and “We Wish You a Merry Christmas” by Frank DeVol & The Rainbow Strings. “Twelve Days of Christmas” by Burl Ives. “Carol of the Bells” by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” “We Three Kings” and “Deck the Halls” by the Norman Luboff Choir. “Sleigh Ride” by Andre Kostelanetz & Orchestra.

Not too shabby for a buck.

Customers raved about the album and Goodyear.

Goodyear executives initially believed that 30000 albums would be plenty for a first pressing but Arnold persuaded them to think bigger. Ultimately Columbia produced over 900000 copies — and that wasn’t enough.

Customers really really wanted the “Great Songs of Christmas” after seeing it advertised on network television and in local newspapers and national magazines. All 4000 Goodyear stores and dealers sold out immediately. Even after replenishing their stock five or six times they couldn’t keep up with demand.

In Akron Goodyear sold the album to its employees at 20 gatehouses and lobbies. The records sold out there too.

People wrote to Goodyear’s headquarters when they couldn’t find a copy. The company had so many requests that it just started mailing out records with notes asking customers to send $1 at their convenience.

The University of Akron’s Archives and Special Collections where Goodyear’s corporate archives are stored has preserved the 60-year-old correspondence. John Ball library associate senior found two long boxes filled with documents letters photos and receipts.

“This is just a line to tell you how much we are enjoying ‘The Great Songs of Christmas.’ I’m sure that this record is the finest thing a dollar has ever bought” wrote Gerald Moore of Fort Atkinson Wisconsin.

“Thank you very much. The record arrived today. It is very beautiful and I’m glad to have it” wrote Helen Rieckus of St. Louis.

“The recordings are very well chosen and beautifully reproduced. We feel you have made a real contribution to the enjoyment of the Christmas season” wrote Dr. Walter E. LeGrange of Bennington Vermont.

“We want you to know that we shall treasure this gift which will add so much pleasure during the Christmas season” wrote Charles Paul of East Hartford Connecticut.

“It has added much happiness to our Christmas season and we never seem to weary of playing it. I’m a Goodyear customer from now on” wrote Donna Johnston of Denver.

That’s exactly what the company wanted to hear. After the first record sold more than 1 million copies Goodyear began releasing a Christmas album every year. Columbia cranked out 1.5 copies in 1962 and 2 million in 1963. All sold for $1.

“It’s a terrific success” advertising chief Kelley noted. “ ‘Great Songs of Christmas’ is our biggest special.”

Other Akron rubber companies took notice. Firestone B.F. Goodrich and General Tire all released Christmas albums after Goodyear.

Performing artists such as Barbara Streisand Bing Crosby Mahalia Jackson Johnny Mathis Petula Clark Robert Goulet Diahann Carroll Ray Conniff Doris Day and the New Christy Minstrels sang on multiple Goodyear albums.

Album 10: Barbra Streisand Tony Bennett Petula Clark Percy Faith Ray Conniff Andy Williams John Davidson Isaac Stern Richard Tucker Anna Moffo Leonard Bernstein Mahalia Jackson Doris Day and Steve Lawrence.

Not all of the tunes were retreads from the Columbia archives.

“A great deal of special recording is commissioned for such an album” marketing consultant Arnold told Billboard magazine in 1966. “Recording teams were sent to England to record Barbra Streisand and Pablo Casals was flown in from Puerto Rico to participate.”

Some families collected all of the records. Some bought only one album and played it every year.

There must still be a lot of them in Greater Akron homes.

The first 10 albums were titled the “Great Songs of Christmas” but Goodyear switched it up with “The Joyous Songs of Christmas” (1971) “Christmas Is” (1972) “The Many Moods of Christmas” (1973) “Carols and Candlelight” (1974) “Henry Mancini Selects Great Songs of Christmas” (1975) “Mancini Moods at Christmastime” (1976) and by popular demand “The Great Songs of Christmas” (1977). RCA Records produced the last three before Goodyear discontinued the premium.

“The Christmas Song” by Johnny Mathis. “Toyland” by Doris Day. “Winter Wonderland” by Lena Horne. “Jingle Bells” by Nelson Eddy. “Sleigh Ride” by Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme.

For kids who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s those tunes on the old Goodyear albums bring back fond memories.

They really were the great songs of Christmas.

With mandatory quarantines easing ferry and airline service resuming and licenses renewed casinos hope 2023 marks a new beginning for the world's preeminent gambling destination Macao.

The Macao government awarded six companies new 10-year concessions to operate their integrated casino resorts. A concession essentially is an operating agreement with the government which in turn licenses the operators.

To win the permission the casino companies agreed to invest collectively nearly $15 billion dollars in Macao to achieve government goals of diversifying the local economy beyond gambling and encouraging international tourism.

CNBC has also learned MGM will benefit from the allotment of 200 more gaming tables though the award comes at the expense of competitors including Wynn's properties according to multiple sources.

""We are confident that our position allocations are more than sufficient to allow us to thrive"" in Macao Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver said. The company serves high-quality players who generate meaningful revenue and profit premiums compared to competing casinos he added.

Las Vegas Sands and Hong Kong-based Galaxy Entertainmen t have the largest real estate footprints in Macao and have committed to the biggest investments.

Sands' agreement for a $3.75 billion dollar investment or 30 billion MOP will be roughly split between capital expenditures and operating expenses. Most of the investment will go toward non-gaming projects like a new conference facility and a luxury yacht experience that appeal to foreign visitors according to a company statement.

An executive in the company who asked not to be named characterized the financial commitment as a win as it entails investments that likely would have been made anyway — as opposed to an operating fee forked over in exchange for a license.

The sentiment is similar at MGM Resorts  which plans to invest its $2.1 billion commitment in three main areas: culture entertainment and medical tourism.

This month Macao has seen an increase in tourism from mainland China from visitors trying to get an mRNA Covid vaccine. The BioNTech shots have not been approved in mainland China but in Macao a Special Administrative Region or SAR the Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST) Hospital offers vaccinations for tourists.

Wynn Resorts ' commitment to a $2.2 billion investment over the next decade will incorporate plans for state-of-the-art theater and restaurant experiences. It also plans to expand its sales presence around Asia and North America to boost international tourism.

Melco Resorts and Entertainment announced the return of its House of Dancing Water extravaganza which has been suspended since the beginning of the pandemic. It will also build an indoor water park. The company also plans to focus on medical tourism by building a clinic with MRI and other advanced imaging technology.

Galaxy will build Macao's first high-tech amusement park. SJM Holdings will renovate its defunct floating casino to offer non-gaming entertainment options.

As the government works to usher in a new era the days of junkets bringing in high rollers to the island is all but finished. Crackdowns had curtailed that segment of the gaming business even before the pandemic began. This week the Macao secretary of finance and the gaming enforcement agency DICJ announced they will increase monitoring and enforcement around even stricter limits.

A rise in Covid infections around China caused November gaming revenue in Macao to fall 23% from October and plummet 99% from November 2019 pre-pandemic levels according to government data.

Even with the resumption of the e-visa program where Chinese travelers can apply electronically for travel documents and the easing of quarantine requirements the Macao government said it anticipates gross gaming revenue or GGR in 2023 to mirror 2022's GGR of roughly $16 billion as Macao struggles with continuing Covid overhang.

But Macao's loss may be Singapore's gain. Sands reported third-quarter results that showed a stunning jump in visitation and spending after Singapore lifted Covid travel restrictions.

Fitch estimates Singapore will achieve 80% of its pre-pandemic gaming revenue in 2022 and 95% in 2023.

Allen Kessler Wins Limit Omaha 8B Championship

Allen Kessler

From December 13-14 the $1100 Limit Omaha 8B Championship took place. With 228 entrants the $100K guarantee was more than doubled as a $221160 prize pool was on offer to the top 23 finishers.

Among those to cash but fall short of the final table were Esther Taylor (10th - $4578) Nathan Gamble (11th - $4578) Calen McNeil (16th - $3178) Ari Engel (18th - $2864) and Barry Shulman (22nd - $2596).

Much to the delight of many poker fans worldwide Allen Kessler who has finished runner-up in four WSOP gold bracelet events closed it out by besting Clyde Gaskins in heads-up play. The victory was good for $52104 and a bit of redemption for the “Chainsaw” as he claimed a desired trophy.

It’s been a bit of a heater for the “Chainsaw” as back in October Kessler topped a field of 41 runners to win the 2022 Orleans Fall Poker Open $400 Eight-Game Mix for $3210. Prior to his recent victories Kessler hadn’t had a tournament victory since 2015 according to the Hendon Mob.

Esther Taylor

Back on December 8 the $3000 8-Game Mix $200K GTD attracted 131 entries which created a $360250 prize pool.

""If you were to look at how we compete against McDonald's in dinner and late night we're absolutely even"" Taco Bell CEO Mark King said during an event with investors this week. ""When you look at breakfast and lunch we're significantly behind.""

King explained that the reason for that gap between the two companies is ""product.""

""So let me talk about lunch"" King said. ""We don't we offer fries half the time. People that go to lunch want to have French fries. We know that. So we're looking at and testing bringing fries permanently on to the menu which would increase our lunch business dramatically.

TACO BELL OPENS FIRST RESTAURANT WITH HIGH-TECH DRIVE-THRU EXPERIENCE

Taco Bell launched its version of French fries known as Nacho Fries in 2018 and has offered them on the menu periodically since then.

King said that 65 million fast food consumers visit his restaurants 12 times a year or more and 100 million more consumers visit the locations once a year.

""So really our drive to more business is not only to keep our cult as we say coming to us but really to expand to these what we call light users. If we can get them to come more frequently we can do that.""

In order to do that King said the chain owned by Louisville Kentucky-based Yum! Brands needs to offer ""differentiated products.""

""We're going to do it with digital"" King said. ""We're going to do it through this one-on-one connection. We're going to do it through focusing on breakfast and lunch.""

It's one thing to enjoy a slice of your favorite delivery pizza in the comfort of your home but it's entirely another thing to eat a few well-deserved slices after completing a feat as grueling as the trek to Africa's highest summit. When Pizza Hut first came to Tanzania in 2016 that was exactly the challenge the popular pizza chain accepted as per a Pizza Hut press release. Luckily victory tasted like cheesy pepperoni.

Mount Kilimanjaro towers a whopping 19340 feet over the African plains its snow-capped peak being one of its most well-known features (via National Geographic). Tens of thousands of adventurers hike this dormant volcano every year making it a popular bucket-list-worthy destination for climbers to spend a few days winding their way to the top. With that being said Pizza Hut decided this was the perfect way to celebrate launching a store location in its 100th country so a team of hikers gathered and a pizza was made to be enjoyed once they completed this special milestone (per the press release). It may sound silly to some lugging a pizza box all that way in the name of celebration but this huge achievement ended up doing a lot of good for the town where Tanzania's first Pizza Hut was opened.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy80LWZhc3QtZm9vZC10cmVuZHMtdG8td2F0Y2gtaW4tMjAyMy0xNTE5MzM2NDcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 fast food trends to watch in 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy80LWZhc3QtZm9vZC10cmVuZHMtdG8td2F0Y2gtaW4tMjAyMy0xNTE5MzM2NDcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000024D80B7A6B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.
