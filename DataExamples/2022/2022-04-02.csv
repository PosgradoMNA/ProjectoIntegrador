The lawsuit filed in Rock Island County Circuit Court by Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul alleges that for decades 3M intentionally hid the dangers of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances from both the public and state officials. The suit also alleges that negligent operations by the company at its Cordova facility located along on banks of the Mississippi River have resulted in significant levels of contamination at and around the plant.

""3M's negligent intentional and reckless actions have contaminated property and natural resources … at and around the Cordova facility harmed property and natural resources … and placed Illinois residents at risk"" the suit states.

A statement from the company says ""3M acted responsibly in connection with its manufacturing operations and products containing PFAS and will vigorously defend its record of environmental stewardship.""

The group of toxic manmade chemicals — commonly known as PFAS or ""forever chemicals"" because they persist indefinitely in the environment — have been linked to serious adverse health effects in humans and animals including various cancers. Exposure to certain types of PFAS has also been associated with low birth weight in babies suppressed immune system response dyslipidemia impaired kidney function and delayed onset of menstruation.

The synthetic chemicals have been in use since the 1940s.

""For decades 3M has been aware of the dangers of PFAS or ‘forever chemicals'"" Raoul said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. ""Despite scientific evidence generated by its own research 3M downplayed or denied the health and environmental hazards connected to PFAS and even promoted these toxic chemicals as being safe to manufacture.""

The suit alleges sampling conducted by 3M and state and federal environmental protection agencies confirmed the presence of contaminated groundwater under and around the facility as well as in the Mississippi River.

""3M must be held accountable for the contamination its operations in Cordova have caused"" Raoul said in a statement. ""This lawsuit is an important step toward accountability and protecting the surrounding environment and public health.”

The attorney general’s office stated it is partnering on the case with a team of outside counsel who has been designated as special assistant attorneys general.

According to the lawsuit 3M has owned and operated its Cordova facility since approximately 1970. It is one of three facilities where 3M manufactures a number of chemical products including adhesives resins fluorochemicals and other specialty chemicals.

The Illinois attorney general alleges that 3M was aware as early as the 1960s that PFAS are toxic and do not biodegrade in the environment. Further the suit alleges 3M testing throughout the 1970s and 1980s confirmed the toxicity of PFAS to aquatic wildlife including fish species.

""Despite that 3M continued to manufacture discharge and dispose of PFAS at the Cordova facility while it promoted PFAS as being safe to manufacture and use' according to a statement from the attorney general's Office.

The lawsuit alleges that 3M leaked and spilled PFAS and PFAS-containing waste from its Cordova facility resulting in significant levels of contamination in groundwater under and around the facility as well as the Mississippi River. In some cases at levels hundreds to thousands of times higher than state and federal health advisory levels.

Testing done at one groundwater monitoring well in 2020 showed PFAS levels several thousand parts per trillion higher than proposed state standards. In addition 3M discharges more than 8 million gallons of contaminated wastewater directly into the Mississippi River each day.

Sampling conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also recently detected levels of toxic PFAS in the wastewater from the Cordova facility at ""levels injurious to public health and welfare and to the environment.""

In addition to sampling performed onsite at the Cordova facility 3M completes annual sampling in the spring of residential wells located near the facility according to the suit.

""3M has detected concentrations of PFBA (perfluorobutyrate one of a group of related chemicals known as perfluorochemicals) at nearly every residential well sampled during every year that sampling has occurred"" the lawsuit states. ""The 2020 residential well results show that multiple residential wells has sample results that exceeded Illinois EPA's current Health Advisory Levels and proposed groundwater standards.""

For example results at two residential wells detected concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) at 5.1 and 10 parts per trillion. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency's current health advisory level and groundwater standard for PFOA is 2 parts per trillion.

""3M has earned extraordinary profits form its PFAS manufacturing business"" according to the suit.

The company agreed in 2000 to stop making forms of PFAS under pressure from the U.S. EPA. That same year 3M reported making almost $500 million per year from the use of these types of products according to testimony former Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson delivered to a U.S. House environmental oversight committee in 2019. 3M is based in St. Paul Minn.

Swanson also testified before the congressional committee that in 2006 the U.S. EPA fined 3M $1.5 million for withholding studies about the toxicity of PFAS that were required to be reported under the Toxic Substances Control Act.

""Despite its explicit knowledge of the dangers of PFAS 3M deliberately and intentionally concealed the dangers of PFAS from governmental entities including the state of Illinois and its agencies and the public at large to protect profits and avoid public responsibility for injuries and damage caused by their toxic products"" according to the Illinois lawsuit. ""To this day 3M continues to actively deny the adverse effects on the environment and human health caused by PFAS contamination stating on its company webpage that the weight of scientific evidence from decades of research does not show that PFOS and PFOA causes harm in people at current or past levels.""

Raoul’s lawsuit seeks monetary damages for the cost to identify monitor and remediate contamination caused by the release of ""forever chemicals"" from 3M's Cordova facility. The lawsuit also seeks civil penalties of up to $50000 for each violation of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act and associated regulations and additional civil penalties of $10000 for each day the violations continue.

In addition the lawsuit seeks damages arising from contamination and injury to the environment and natural resources as well as injunctive relief requiring 3M to prevent ongoing contamination and remediate contaminated areas ""and restore resources injured or impacted by PFAS released from the Cordova facility.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2Jyb29rbHluLWJlY2toYW0tc2lnbnMtcHJlbnVwLWFoZWFkLTA4MDAwMDY4MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brooklyn Beckham signs prenup ahead of £3m wedding to heiress Nicola Peltz,"Brooklyn Beckham has reportedly signed a prenuptial agreement ahead of his £3 million wedding to heiress Nicola Peltz next weekend.

XFILES

Brooklyn’s ex American actress Chloe Grace Moretz 25 may well be among the guests. The pair dated from 2014 to 2018.

But one of the groom’s former flames who definitely will not be in attendance is Brit singer-songwriter Tallia Storm 23 who made a thinly veiled dig last month saying of his wedding: “I couldn’t care less . . . we were together when we were kids.” Nicola once dated model Gigi Hadid’s brother Anwar 22.

YARMULKE

It will be a Jewish ceremony to honour Nicola’s heritage. Brooklyn said he will have on a yarmulke the head covering worn by Jewish men.

Similac PM 60/40 has now also been recalled after a baby exposed to this powdered baby formula died.

Our lawyers are pursuing Similac recall lawsuits in all 50 states for severe injury and wrongful death claims.

When the Similac recall was announced our attorneys were under the impression there would be a handful of severe injury and wrongful death cases from this recall.

We were wrong. While 2023 has seen new cases mostly die out our law firm received hundreds of calls many of which are from parents whose child has suffered severe injury or death from food poisoning from Similac. It is an awful thing that happened and it exacerbated a baby formula shortage that also caused a lot of pain. The government and Abbott are working now to make sure it never happens again.

April 3 2024 Similar Lawsuit Update

Yesterday Abbott Laboratories successfully defended against a class action lawsuit concerning economic losses linked to its baby formula. The lawsuit was brought forth by purchasers of Abbott’s powdered infant formula including Similac Alimentum and EleCare which was allegedly contaminated. However the plaintiffs could not prove they had purchased contaminated products or that they had suffered personal injury leading to the dismissal of their case by a federal appeals court. This does not impact personal injury or wrongful death claims related to the Similac recall.

The plaintiffs based their legal standing on potential economic harm due to unsanitary conditions at Abbott’s facility in Sturgis Michigan. Nonetheless the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit deemed such harm too speculative noting that at the time of purchase the risk of contamination was not apparent. Additionally Abbott had offered refunds following warnings from the FDA and CDC negating any immediate risk to the plaintiffs.

The court highlighted that the plaintiffs did not experience a loss of value or pay more than the product’s worth having received the infant formula as intended. He further clarified that their claims lacked specificity since they could not demonstrate that the formula they bought was indeed contaminated rendering their alleged injury too broad and non-specific.

December 12 2023 Similac Lawsuit Update

Two infants are said to have been seriously affected by cronobacter sakazakii infections in 2023 after consuming powdered infant formula made by Abbott Nutrition. The infections resulted in the death of a child in Kentucky and significant brain damage in a Missouri infant. Federal health officials have stated there is no evidence linking the infections to formula manufacturing processes and no recall has been issued. The bacteria which are commonly found in the environment can contaminate formula after it is opened.

November 28 2023 Similac Lawsuit Update

Judge Kennelly has established a bellwether trial process for the Similac lawsuit to assess the strengths and weaknesses of various claims. The bellwether trial process in a multidistrict litigation (MDL) involves selecting a small group of representative cases from a larger pool of similar lawsuits for early trial. These trials are used to gauge the reaction of juries to the evidence and arguments providing valuable insights that can guide settlement discussions and strategies for the remaining cases in the MDL.

So this involves preparing a small number of representative cases for jury trials. This summer Similac recall lawyers on both sides were instructed to select five cases each for the initial bellwether discovery pool with specific types of cases required including cronobacter salmonella diagnosis and meningitis injury claims.

Out of this came nine lawsuits were chosen as the initial bellwether cases with some overlap in selections by both parties. These include cases involving salmonella food poisoning linked to Similac and a Cronobacter Sakazakii case.

November 8 2023 Similac Lawsuit Update

Two parents from Georgia have filed a lawsuit against Abbott accusing the company of negligence and other misconduct after their infant became severely ill from consuming Abbott’s powdered baby formula which was allegedly contaminated with bacteria.

The legal action initiated on Thursday in a Georgia federal court claims Abbott was aware of the contamination five months prior to issuing a recall. The lawsuit alleges that Abbott had been notified of similar contamination issues by the FDA after a September 2021 investigation by the Minnesota Department of Health linked an infant’s illness to the company’s formula.

With four additional illness cases reported from November 2021 to January 2022 resulting in hospitalizations and two deaths the plaintiffs argue they would have avoided using the contaminated formula if they had been warned. They are suing for a range of charges including fraud negligence and violation of Georgia’s deceptive trade practices laws. This looks like a strong case because it was well after Abbott had a lot of information on the problems in Michigan

October 26 2023 Similac Lawsuit Update

The FDA recently sent Abbott Laboratories a strong warning letter advising the company that its Similac Tri-Blend infant formula product contains ingredients that may be harmful to infants. The letter identified 2 specific ingredients in the formula that are unsafe or lack adequate information about their safety. This comes on the heels of a bad 2 years for Abbott and Similac formula.

August 17 2023 Similac Lawsuit Update

There are now a total of 52 pending cases in the Similac formula recall class action MDL against Abbott Laboratories. This is a somewhat lower number that we initially expect for this MDL which was created 11 months ago.

July 27 2023 Similac Lawsuit Update

Earlier this week the parties in the class action MDL involving the bacteria contamination of Similac formula submitted a joint proposal for selecting and scheduling the first round of bellwether test trials.

Under the plan each side will pick 5 cases to go through case-specific bellwether discovery. After discovery 5 of the 10 cases will be selected as candidates for bellwether trials with the final selections made by the MDL Judge.

Another baby formula manufacturer reports concerns of bacteria in its product.

November 21 2022 Similac Lawsuit Update

Last week the FDA announced it is considering implementing a new strategy to avoid future bacteria contamination at infant formula factories. This comes in response to the nationwide infant formula shortage caused partly by the shutdown of a significant formula manufacturing plant in Michigan due to contamination issues.

Under the proposal the FDA would form a new team of formula inspectors and increase its involvement and regulatory oversight.

October 1 2022 Similac Lawsuit Update

There is a new Similac recall class action lawsuit.

The JPML has agreed to consolidate all lawsuits in federal court involving Abbott’s infant formula recall which was traced back to contamination from its plant in Sturgis Michigan in February 2022.

The new MDL Abbott recall class action lawsuit will include personal injury cases and consumer class action cases alleging economic loss related to the formula contamination and recall.

Illinois is the epicenter of baby formula lawsuits. The MDL class action has been assigned to Judge Matthew F. Kennelly in the Northern District of Illinois where Abbott is headquartered.

July 20 2022 Similac Recall Update

Just 11 days after production finally resumed at its embattled infant formula facility in Sturgis MI Abbott was forced to announce on Wednesday that the plant was again being shut down temporarily. Abbott can’t seem to do anything right.

The facility is being shut down this time because torrential rains caused flash flooding at the plant. The plant had spent the last four months on the shelf as the FDA investigated bacteria contamination in powdered infant formula.

The Sturgis plant has recently become the focal point of public anger as an acute baby formula shortage has plagued the U.S. The reopening of the plant two weeks ago was fast-tracked in a desperate effort to help alleviate the shortage but now that will be on hold until the flood damage can be addressed.

July 13 2022 Similac Recall Update

Just as the embattled baby formula plant in Michigan is finally resuming operations it is now being reported that a former Abbott employee filed a whistleblower complaint about the facility with OSHA back in February 2021. The complaint reported various concerns about the plant and claimed that records were being falsified. More significantly it shows that federal authorities noticed the problems at the Sturgis MI facility over a year before those conditions eventually led to a Similac recall and an acute shortage of baby formula.

June 6 2022 Similac Recall Update

At the end of last week (June 4) the FDA finally allowed production operations to restart at Abbott’s formula manufacturing plant in Sturgis MI. A dangerous bacteria outbreak was linked to the facility and the FDA’s subsequent investigation identified numerous violations and unsanitary conditions. This prompted an emergency shutdown of the entire plant which lasted several months before operations finally resumed last week.

Infant formula shortages were starting across the U.S. even before the issues at the Michigan facility arose. Still the shutdown worsened and became the focal point of public outrage. The Sturgis facility can reopen under the terms of a strict consent decree between Abbott and the FDA.

June 1 2022 Similac Recall Update

FDA Commissioner Robert Califf was called before Congress last week to testify about the Similac recall and the shutdown of the Abbott formula plant in Michigan.

The shutdown and related Similac recall have played a large part in the acute baby formula shortage that has hit the U.S. this year and captured national attention recently. Commissioner Califf provided lawmakers with the details of the various sanitation deficiencies at the Abbott plant in Michigan that prompted the shutdown.

Califf also admitted that it took his agency several months to respond to the initial whistleblower report that alerted the FDA to the problem.

I have been saying I think the settlement amounts in severe injury and death lawsuits involving the Similac recall will be very high. This provides a further foundation for my prediction on settlement. Because everyone screwed this up.

Does this mean you will see high settlement payouts for insignificant injury Similac recall lawsuits? No. But the serious injury and death cases may have very high settlement amounts.

May 3 2022 Similac Recall Update

One of the plaintiffs who recently filed a Similac recall lawsuit on behalf of his infant daughter is seeking a class action lawsuit.

Her Similac recall lawyer has filed a motion asking the JPML to consolidate all other lawsuits involving the Similac recall into a new mass-tort MDL.

The motion identifies 18 pending Similac recall cases in 6 different federal districts. Sixteen of the eighteen instances are putative class actions that seek to represent the interests of thousands of unidentified infants.

The plaintiffs allege that their infants developed bacterial infections from the recalled Similac formula.

March 30 2022 Similac Recall Update

The FDA released a preliminary report detailing the findings of its investigation into the recent contamination of powdered Similac at Abbott’s plant in Michigan. Not surprisingly the FDA accuses Abbott of failing to take appropriate steps (such as regularly cleaning surfaces) to prevent product contamination.

Inspectors noted similar deficiencies in previous routine inspections of the Sturgis Michigan plant where a great deal of Similac was made. It will issue later more detailed findings and conclusions.

Abbott has issued a statement saying it has “already begun implementing corrective actions.” This is not helpful for children who have already suffered from Similac food poisoning. Nor is the baby formula shortage that this recall has exacerbated.

Cronobacter sakazakii Bacteria Recall

The recalled products from this facility may be contaminated with Cronobacter sakazakii a dangerous bacterium that can pose a grave risk to infants. At least four reported cases of infants being hospitalized due to the contaminated formulas.

Our firm is now accepting cases from parents of infants who developed a bacterial infection from consuming contaminated Similac formula.

FDA Launches Investigation of Cronobacter Contamination in Powdered Formula

On February 17 2022 the FDA issued a public announcement stating that the administration was investigating possible bacteria contamination in powdered infant formula products manufactured at the Abbott Laboratories plant in Sturgis Michigan. The powdered infant formula products produced at this facility include Abbott’s flagship brand Similac and lesser brands EleCare and Alimentum.

The investigation was initiated after the FDA received four complaints of infants hospitalized with Cronobacter sakazakii infections.

All four infants in the complaints were infected after consuming powdered baby formula products made at the Abbott plant in Michigan. The infected infants came from three different states (Minnesota Ohio and Texas) and one of the infants died due to complications related to the infection.

The FDA stopped inspecting the Michigan plant during COVID. When they resumed inspections they found evidence of Cronobacter sakazakii. Alarms went off because we knew this deadly bacteria can survive for years in powdered baby formula.

The FDA public announcement cautioned consumers to avoid purchasing or using powdered baby formula products made at the Sturgis Michigan plant. FDA investigators are conducting an onsite inspection of the Abbott plant in Michigan and testing environmental samples. This inspection has already found evidence that confirms the presence of Cronobacter contamination at the facility.

Here is a quote from Politico on March 5 2022 that summarizes this mess:

“It’s kind of alarming that we know more about Russian military tactics in Ukraine than we do about FDA’s actions regarding the Abbott facility.” – Brian Ronholm Director of Food Policy at Consumer Reports.

Cronobacter Infections Are Hard on Babies

Cronobacter sakazakii (previously known as Enterobacter sakazakii) is a type of bacteria that is found naturally in various environments. Cronobacter is known to thrive in certain dry foods and high-starch mediums such as powdered milk herbal teas and powdered infant formulas. In adults Cronobacter can be a nuisance that triggers intestinal distress diarrhea and in some cases urinary tract infections.

Cronobacter infections can be very harmful and potentially life-threatening for newborns and infants. Infants have underdeveloped gastrointestinal systems that are less able to contain dangerous bacteria. Cronobacter infections in infants (particularly premature infants) can rapidly progress into deadly systemic infections such as sepsis (an infection of the bloodstream) and meningitis (infection involving the brain and spinal cord).

Initial symptoms of Cronobacter infections in babies include fever and refusal to feed often accompanied by lethargy. Cronobacter infections in infants are relatively rare but when they occur they are almost always the result of contaminated powdered infant formula. This is because Cronobacter germs can survive in the dry environments of powdered food stores.

Abbott Announces Recall of Powdered Formula Products

A day after the FDA publicly announced its investigation Abbott Laboratories initiated a “voluntary” recall of all powdered formula products made at the company’s Sturgis Michigan facility. The recall covered powdered versions of Abbott’s formula products including Similac Alimentum and EleCare formulas.

According to Abbott the recalled products were distributed across the U.S. and to several other countries worldwide. Abbott established a Similac recall website to help consumers determine whether the recall covers their product.

Abbott Hardly Surprised by Cronobacter Sakazakii in Formula

No one at Abbott could be stunned about the Cronobacter sakazakii in baby formula. Abbott had already found cronobacter at the plant five times in the last two years. Worse still this deadly bacteria twice found its way into baby formula. Abbott did not send those cans out for sale. It pulled those batches out of the distribution chain. But Abbott did not recall any others and we don’t know exactly what they did to address the problem.

But the whole Michigan plant was a mess. The FDA found drying equipment with a history of pits and cracks. This is a haven for cronobacter to hide and multiply.

Recall Is More Bad News for Infant Formula Makers

The recent Similac recall due to possible contamination is just the latest in a string of adverse events related to Similac and other infant formulas.

Over the last 16 months Abbott and Mead Johnson (the maker of Enfamil) have been defending a growing number of baby formula lawsuits alleging that they failed to warn that their formulas put premature babies at increased risk of a dangerous infection called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). These NEC lawsuits are about to be consolidated into a new class-action lawsuit. Abbott and other manufacturers have also had to deal with supply-chain-related shortages that have made headlines recently.

Similac Recall Class Action Lawsuit

Parents of babies who develop a Cronobacter infection from consuming contaminated Similac from Abbott’s Michigan facility will be entitled to financial compensation for their medical expenses and pain & suffering. A large number of Similac recall lawsuits are expected to be filed which could lead to a new class-action MDL in which all Similac recall lawsuits in federal court would be consolidated together.

The Similac recall lawsuits are now in a class action. These lawsuits will follow a path similar to other mass torts involving recalled consumer products. The Similac recall lawsuits are consolidated before a single judge who would oversee a process of consolidated discovery as additional lawsuits are added to the class action. A few representative cases will be selected for jury trials known as “bellwether” trials. The results of these test trials should then facilitate some global settlement in which Abbott agrees to pay a lump sum to resolve all pending cases.

FAQs: Similac Recall

Why was Similac recalled? Abbott recalled powdered Similac formula products manufactured at its Sturgis Michigan facility due to a possible Cronobacter contamination at the plant that may be linked to 4 cases of infant hospitalizations. Cronobacter infections can be perilous for newborns.

What Similac products were recalled? Only powdered Similac formula products manufactured at the Abbott facility in Sturgis MI were recalled. No liquid formula products have been recalled.

Should the NCAA and universities be pressured or forced to change its longstanding policy?

This notion while seemingly sensible at first glance is badly misguided. If colleges were required to pay athletes salaries the entire fabric of amateur college sports could unravel harming the interests of fans colleges and — most important — players themselves. Let’s see why.

The National Collegiate Athletics Association is a nonprofit organization that regulates student-athletes and organizes the athletic programs of its member colleges and universities in the United States and Canada. The NCAA also “helps over 480000 college student athletes who compete annually in college sports.”

In its 1984 NCAA v. Board of Regents decision the Supreme Court ruled that “artificial limits” on the quantity of televised football games imposed by the NCAA reduced competition and violated antitrust laws. But at the same time the court emphasized that certain other NCAA restrictions on athletes — including salary bans — were key to the preservation of the college football “product”:

“In order to preserve the character and quality of the (NCAA) ‘product’ athletes must not be paid must be required to attend class and the like. … Thus the NCAA plays a vital role in enabling college football to preserve its character and as a result enables a product to be marketed which might otherwise be unavailable.”

The court believed that loss of amateur status will cause a popular alternative to big-time pro sports to lose its luster. But there are lots of other bad things that will happen if the NCAA drops restrictions on paying salaries to athletes.

Eliminating “no salary” rules will favor large well-funded athletic programs over others likely undermining already tenuous competitive balance among schools. Think of an NCAA March Madness tournament where an even-higher percentage of elite players have been snapped up by big-name schools and “Cinderella stories” all but disappear.

It will also incentivize the shifting of large college athletic departments’ funds to bidding for big-name high school basketball and football superstars whose presence will attract future lucrative contributor donations endorsements and television deals. In addition to reducing team cohesion between stars and other players this could eventually transform college football and basketball into little more than ugly minor leagues for their pro counterparts.

The tiny proportion of superstars who would receive a year or two of high salaries will gain relatively little because they are destined for far larger professional contracts in the very near future. Meanwhile the vast majority of college athletes — who never go pro — will end up losing.

The biggest losers will be the myriad scholarship athletes — young men and women alike — who compete in non-revenue producing sports such as swimming wrestling gymnastics volleyball and track and field just to name a few. These athletes cannot realistically expect significant salaries.

Even worse they can expect reduced funding and fewer scholarships due to the increased focus on paying big-revenue sports superstars. As such a key quality of their college experience will be diminished as amateurism is swept aside.

Sticking with the existing NCAA rules would allow many more promising but non-superstar athletes in revenue-generating sports to develop their skills over time without pressure enhancing their ability for some to eventually compete at the professional level.

In addition the current rules climate already allows for many student athletes to receive endorsements and even those who do not can develop personal connections that serve them well in their professional and personal lives including connections derived from the university’s popularity. (Think of wealthy and well-connected alumni who are huge fans of their colleges’ athletic programs.)

Finally it’s not clear that college athletes who are compensated with scholarships and living expenses are materially “underpaid” and are “exploited.” One major economic study of NCAA rules by economists Richard McKenzie and Dwight Lee for example rejected this idea.

The conclusion is clear. The NCAA has its reasons for keeping its rules against paying college athletes. These should remain for the good of fans and college athletes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL2FiYm90dC1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LW5leHQtZ3JlYXQtc2l0Y29tL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Abbott Elementary Could Be the Next Great Sitcom,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL2FiYm90dC1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LW5leHQtZ3JlYXQtc2l0Y29tL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjIvMDQvMDIvYmV0by1vcm91cmtlLXRvdXRzLWVkdWNhdGlvbi1qb2JzLWFuZC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS12b3dzLXRvLWZvcmNlZnVsbHktaGFtbWVyLWdvcC1nb3YtZ3JlZy1hYmJvdHQv0gGjAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMi8wNC8wMi9iZXRvLW9yb3Vya2UtdG91dHMtZWR1Y2F0aW9uLWpvYnMtYW5kLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLXZvd3MtdG8tZm9yY2VmdWxseS1oYW1tZXItZ29wLWdvdi1ncmVnLWFiYm90dC8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beto O’Rourke touts education jobs and health care vows to forcefully hammer GOP Gov. Greg Abbott,"GRAND PRAIRIE — With the uproar over last year’s winter storm in a holding pattern Democratic nominee for governor Beto O’Rourke is trying to sell Texas voters on bread-and-butter issues that he hopes will compel them to fire incumbent Greg Abbott.

In varied events across the state O’Rourke is pounding three topics — jobs education and health care — as critical reasons to elect him governor.

It’s a transition of sorts. O’Rourke is coming off of a 20-city tour designed to highlight the state officials’ failure in securing the Texas power grid which resulted in sweeping power outages and more than 240 deaths. While he still discusses the grid issue O’Rourke hopes to better connect with Texas voters by discussing basic -- but sometimes elusive --government services.

“I want to make sure that we always begin with and focus on the big important things. And so I keep coming back to jobs schools and the ability to see a doctor because almost all of us can agree on those things” O’Rourke said during a recent campaign stop in Grand Prairie.

“You and I may disagree on the issue of abortion or may have different opinions when it comes to transgender children. But we can agree that we should be creating more higher paying jobs in the state of Texas.”

O’Rourke is the underdog in his race against Republican Abbott who has been casting the Democrat as a flip-flopper who is trying to gull Texas voters. Though he’s traveled to towns in Texas big and small his crowds have been pedestrian compared to what he attracted in his 2018 Senate campaign against GOP incumbent Ted Cruz.

What’s more O’Rourke still bears the stain from his 2020 presidential bid in which he moved to the left on positions like gun control and energy policy.

“Beto O’ Rourke has run one of the most lackluster campaigns ever changing policy positions daily depending on which part of the state he happens to be in” said Abbott campaign spokesman Mark Miner. “The only thing Beto has been consistent on is his complete inconsistency on issues. No matter how hard he tries to reinvent himself we will continue reminding the public of his support for gun control open borders and the Green New Deal that will kill hundreds of thousands of Texas energy jobs.”

Along with his core issues the former El Paso congressman said he’s going to be more of a fighter than pacifist a major change in his campaign style. In his 2018 race against Cruz O’Rourke shied away from directly confronting or criticizing his rival leaving such contacts up to his allies. O’Rourke said he’s now taking the fight to Abbott a renowned political brawler who likes the contact.

“I’m going to vigorously and aggressively prosecute the case on why we need to retire Greg Abbott from this office and hire me” O’Rourke said.

O’Rourke said that in 2018 he left it up to voters to form their own opinions on Cruz but this time it will be different.

“People need to know why we lost power last February why we are doing so poorly in our schools why we are struggling when it comes to career opportunities” he said.

Democrats applaud O’Rourke’s aggression.

“You can’t win if voters don’t decide to fire who has the job now” said Democratic strategist Harold Cook. “He’s more disciplined about a number of the issues and his focus seems to be based on data and he’s making it relevant to the incumbent’s shortcomings. I don’t know if it’s going to show up in the results or not but he’s going to be a lot better off as a candidate doing it that way.”

O’Rourke’s campaign for governor is in stark contrast to his 2018 Senate bid when he built star power that led to mega-rallies and prolific fundraising. Now a known player on the political scene O’Rourke’s events are no longer jamming up traffic.

Still O’Rourke hopes his campaign for governor will lead to not only a strong voter turnout effort but a crash course in how to move Texas forward.

“Focusing on the things that matter most to us instead of the things that divide us or keep us apart that’s not only the right thing to do it’s the way I want to lead as governor” O’Rourke said. “It gives people including Democrats Republicans and independents alike a campaign that they can be part of.”

Jobs health care education

Abbott and fellow Republicans are in the driver’s seat for this year’s midterm elections and are engaging voters through issues like border security parental rights in schools increased restrictions on abortion curbing the use of mail-in ballots and outlawing some medical treatments given to transgender kids.

These culture-war topics are tried-and-true motivators for Republican base voters and they are expected to still be key for them in November general election.

But in 2018 Democrats gained traction by talking about health care issues including the need to block then President Donald Trump and the GOP from repealing the Affordable Care Act.

O’Rourke came within 2.6 % of defeating Cruz then while Democrats gained 12 seats in the Texas House and two in the state’s congressional delegation including the seat currently held by Dallas Democrat Colin Allred.

O’Rourke hopes kitchen table issues will propel Democrats again.

“The sensational stuff can catch our attention and can rile us up in the short term but the big basic things like the kind of job you can look forward to working or the kind of career that you can have over the course of your life that’s what’s most important to us” O’Rourke said.

At his campaign appearances the former Congressman has been trying to connect basic service issues to the experiences of Texans.

In a March roundtable in Crockett O’Rourke listened to residents concerned about health care in rural communities. According to O’Rourke 26 hospitals in 23 Texas rural communities have closed.

Jackie Redwine a traveling nurse said rural residents don’t have access to the same health care services as city dwellers.

“There is no pediatric neurologist within 200 miles of here” Redwine said. “That’s par for the course with rural hospitals. You have to go to the big cities to get a specialist. In the rural communities you have to wait for care because you don’t have that access to care.”

“It really is a crisis right now” O’Rourke said at the event. “We have to meet it with the urgency that this kind of crisis demands.”

Julie Ross a Dallas health care and disability rights advocate said O’Rourke should continue to press the health care issue including the need for Texas officials to expand Medicaid and accept the federal dollars that would come to the state under the Affordable Care Act.

“I know that Beto has talked about this but now more than ever we need to expand Medicaid” Ross said. “We’re already subsidizing it with our federal dollars anyway. It’s foolish to leave that money on the table and allow Texans to suffer.”

In Grand Prairie O’Rourke with his family with him met with union members who teach an apprenticeship program that prepares residents for jobs as electricians.

“In our schools we should focus on the fact that seven out of 10 fourth-graders cannot read at grade level right now” O’Rourke said after the meeting. “So with that being the case why is the current governor focused on which kids can play which middle school athletics and turning in the parents of certain transgender kids for accusations of child abuse? Let’s focus on the big things on the things that we can agree on on the things that pull Democrats and Republicans together.“

On the attack against Abbott

Democrats are also pleased that O’Rourke is trying to match Abbott punch for punch. He comments on social media with criticisms of the governor and blasts Abbott at rallies.

“Taking the fight to Abbott is the right approach” said state Rep. Chris Turner D-Arlington.

O’Rourke’s constant criticism of Abbott over state power grid issues continues to surface even though Texas got through winter this year without major problems.

“We certainly have to make the case about where we have been failed by those in power right now and what happened last February is central to this argument” O’Rourke said.

Abbott and his campaign team have accused O’Rourke of hoping the grid fails to help his political prospects. They point to the slew of legislation signed into law last year to fortify the grid though experts say more work is needed particularly with on natural gas concerns.

“He continues to run a campaign based on tearing down Texas” said Miner Abbott’s campaign spokesperson.

At his events O’Rourke does say Texans need to unify around a common set of goals.

“We’ve had enough of fighting the culture war stuff and polarization and division” O’Rourke said in Grand Prairie. “Let’s get back together again. And I think these three issues have the power to do it.”"

A pair of management consultants have joined the election fray on opposite sides of the country and for opposing parties. Former McKinsey & Company partner Simon Kennedy has been elected as a Liberal candidate for the Sydney seat of Bennelong while Labor has selected Azure Consulting’s Yannick Spencer as its candidate for the Perth seat of Curtin.

Accenture’s Andrew Charlton has meanwhile been confirmed as Labor’s candidate for Parramatta.

Simon Kennedy

Having now resigned Kennedy was with McKinsey & Company for over 14 years and is credited with co-founding the management consulting giant’s public sector practice in Australia – which is today its biggest money-spinner pulling in almost $60 million in the last financial year from the federal government alone. He was admitted to McKinsey’s partnership in 2016 and had previously spent seven years with the firm in Washington.

According to reports Kennedy comfortably defeated the centre-moderate favourite Gisele Kapterian a former ministerial advisor who has since 2019 served as a senior director of APAC Public Sector Strategy for Salesforce.

As a traditionally safe Liberal seat currently held by retiring former tennis player John Alexander Kennedy has a good chance of joining energy minister and fellow McKinsey ex-partner Angus Talyor as a member of parliament.

Yannick Spencer

Indeed another McKinsey alumus could also enter parliament in May with Yannick Spencer contesting the seat of Curtin – where he’ll incidentally be up against independent Kate Chaney a former principal at Boston Consulting Group. Spencer spent three years with McKinsey in Melbourne and Perth before later going on to join recent Oliver Wyman acquisition Azure Consulting where he was promoted to associate director last year.

With Azure since 2016 Spencer works predominantly in the energy and natural resources sector with a focus on climate and sustainability work (action on climate change is a campaign platform) advising on corporate strategy business unit strategy and organisational design and effectiveness.

According to his Azure bio he also has extensive experience in the utilities government and policy aged care retail higher education and industrial products sectors.

Andrew Charlton

Meanwhile Labor has confirmed Accenture managing director Andrew Charlton for the seat of Parramatta after being elected unopposed. Charlton was one of two candidates the federal branches of both major parties have been attempting to parachute into Sydney seats alongside PwC management consultant Alex Dore – the latter which still remains unresolved at the time of writing although the Liberal federal executive cancelled a pre-selection ballot last week.

“I’ve spent the last 20 years as an economist and a business owner building stronger economies and stronger communities and that is exactly what I want to do as the member of Parramatta” Charlton said. “Helping people with the financial pressures on families especially childcare costs creating the building blocks of opportunity skills and infrastructure and helping to ensure Parramatta is a jobs hub for good high paid high skilled jobs and strong small businesses.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJ1c2luZXNzZGVzay5jb20vd2VzdG1pZGxhbmRzL25ld3MvMjA2MjY2NS0zMDAtam9icy10by1iZS1heGVkLWJ5LXNhaW5zYnVyeSVFMiU4MCU5OXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,300 jobs to be axed by Sainsbury's | TheBusinessDesk.com,"300 jobs to be axed by Sainsbury’s

Sainsbury’s is set to cut 300 jobs across its store support centres in Ansty in Warwickshire Manchester and Holborn London.

The supermarket giant will now outsource its commercial finance operations people services and HR to Accenture.

The move follows the announcement made in March where the supermarket put 2000 jobs at risk due to its plans to shut its 200 in-store cafes.

A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We are focused on our plans to put food back at the heart of Sainsbury’s.

“To achieve this we are becoming a more simple nimble and efficient business so that we can reinvest in what matters most to customers – low prices exciting new products and convenient ways to shop.

“We are talking to a small proportion of our store support centre colleagues about some changes we are proposing to the way we work.

“Colleagues affected will enter into a consultation process and we are supporting them through this in any way we can”.

It also is discussing with a number of staff plans to close less popular hot food counters in 34 stores and changes to how it runs its bakeries."

After indie rocker Nina Diaz left her native San Antonio for Los Angeles she discovered the local theater community that would go on to create Adobe Punk  a play about three young punk musicians squatting in a vacant adobe house in the working-class community of Bell Gardens.

The show set in the early 1980s was co-created by playwright and director Theresa Chavez and her son Gabriel Garza. Diaz co-wrote the songs with Chavez.

The two met on a 2019 production of Evangeline the Queen of Make-Believe  which Chavez co-wrote and directed. Diaz played in the show’s band.

That play followed 1968’s East L.A. high school walkouts and featured music by local rock legends Los Lobos. It was Diaz’s first time working on a play since second grade and she said she fell in love with theater company About Productions and the way it gives voice to Latin artists.

When she heard Adobe Punk was in the works the resonance with her own story had her hyped. She likened the project’s vibe to that of one of her favorite movies SLC Punk .

“In my mind I was thinking ‘Please ask me to be part of it in some way. It’s so up my alley. Please please please please please.’ But I didn’t have the confidence yet to say ‘Hey if I can be involved in any way’” Diaz said.

A Working Class SoCal Story

Diaz now 34 performed with punk band Girl In A Coma in the 2000s and 2010s but she eventually quit the band got sober and began to follow her solo rock star dreams.

Though she’s not from around here Diaz said she knows more about California than San Antonio and she connects with the world of Bell Gardens and the working class environment depicted in the play.

“It felt like this is a part of me in some way” Diaz said.

Her father her grandfather “everybody worked in the fields” she said “so I can understand when you’re breaking your back to earn nothing.”

Diaz struggled creatively while living in L.A. writing just three new songs because she was consumed by her day job and other personal issues. But she used the time to collect personal experiences to have something to write about.

“I just listened to anything and took in the stories and made space for what it was all about” she said.

Diaz moved back to San Antonio shortly before the pandemic but the experience stayed with her.

“I love who I am in Los Angeles” she said. “I made roots there. I made friends there I made family there.”

Finding A “Kindred Spirit”

It was in the summer of 2021 well into the coronavirus pandemic that Chavez contacted Diaz about getting involved. Chavez asked her to write music to go with Chavez’s lyrics. While Diaz tried to play it cool she said yes right away.

“I have a horrible poker face” she said.

Diaz connected with the way Chavez and Garza talked about the show likening it to how she herself talks about an album or a song.

“You can tell the difference between somebody that’s talking about something because ‘Oh this is going to give me a peg up in the industry’” Diaz said. “It felt like ‘This is a passion of mine.’ Of course we want to make a living out of what we do but there didn’t seem [to be] any malicious strings attached to this creative process.”

Diaz said it was unusual for her to find someone she connected with so well.

“Usually you’re like ‘OK this is nice but I know I’m never going to work with you again’” Diaz said. “With Theresa I’m like ‘We’re gonna form a band’ … beyond Adobe Punk.”

The two had a similar approach to their work “which sometimes might not seem the most stable to a lot of people” she said “but we get it done. We get it done with passion with power. And I felt like I found a kindred spirit of ‘I’m not crazy to work like this.’”

Healing While Finding Her Old Punk Rock Mindset

According to Diaz co-writing this show’s songs put her back in the mindset of her Girl In A Coma years.

“I was writing some pretty cool stuff at 13 14 years old” Diaz said. She was hard on herself at the time but now she tells herself “‘You’re a good writer you know what you’re doing. Just stop stopping yourself.’”

Diaz said she found it both refreshing and cathartic to put herself back in that mindset. She said she’s still healing and learning to forgive herself after some traumatic experiences in her teens and early 20s.

“Sometimes if the most traumatic thing happens during that time you’re forever that age in a weird way” Diaz said. “So I felt some sort of connection to these characters especially as they’re trying to find themselves. That’s the time right? Where do I fit? What do I do?”

Diaz said she knew when she was young that she wanted music to be her life but she wasn’t sure where it would lead.

“The fact that these characters were still trying to figure out what are they going to do but they know they have a passion I felt like I could get something out of it” she said.

Diaz also used composing for Adobe Punk as a stress relief from working on her second solo album which she recently completed (it’s set for release this summer). It’s her first time engineering and recording an album herself. She’s also taking classes online with the L.A. Film School to continue growing her skills as an engineer — she recently set up her own home studio and production company with a goal of supporting women in San Antonio who want to become engineers.

Creating The Sound Of Adobe Punk

Chavez continued writing straight into the middle of the rehearsal process working with Diaz to create the show’s sound. Diaz would record demos getting notes back from Chavez along the way.

For Diaz the show was a chance to put some of her recent musical development to use. She had made money during much of the pandemic by recording cover songs in a wide variety of styles for people on the Internet which she described as “online busking.” Beyond punk she’d do songs by Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez. The experience was like going to music school for her.

This show was also Diaz’s first time starting with lyrics and adding the music rather than riffing musically and finding the lyrics from there. As she and Chavez worked Diaz would help tweak the lyrics to fit the music or pull in a line from elsewhere in the play.

Diaz said she wants the experience of going to see Adobe Punk to be like live screenings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show or the show Hedwig and the Angry Inch with audiences yelling and fully participating.

Adobe Punk’s songs are catchy Diaz promises thanks both to her music and Chavez’s lyrics. She said she hopes the songs get released outside the show.

Meanwhile the actors who play the members of Adobe Punk’s Bell System have formed an actual band and they might even play some of their own live shows.

Diaz had the chance to play with them at a benefit show providing vocals while they backed her up. It took her back to that second grade theater production. In that show she was supposed to hold up signs with the days of the week on them but she accidentally held them upside-down. As a second grader the audience found it adorable. Years later in Adobe Punk they put up their own sign for Bell System — and they too managed to put it up backwards.

“I loved it” Diaz said.

You can see the final shows of this run of Adobe Punk through this Sunday. There are hopes of mounting a future production in Bell Gardens and if that happens Diaz said she wants to go back to see it there — and visit the community while she’s at it.

Little did she know she was about to embark on some fun tied to history arts crafts and even goats.

“I was very excited” she said Saturday.

“Kids Day at the Adobe” at Peña Adobe Park hosted by the Peña Adobe Historical Society brought families out to the centuries-old Adobe for some fun and opportunities to learn more about the history of one of the oldest buildings in Solano County.

Peña Adobe Historical Society President Cricket Kanouff expressed enthusiasm for the event which had long been postponed due to the pandemic.

“We were very excited (to host) because we are volunteers and we can’t help ourselves” Kanouff chuckled.

Those in attendance found themselves with plenty to do. As they walked up they were greeted by the sweet sounds of the Vacaville Jammers playing songs from the past and the present including from the likes of Darius Rucker and John Denver.

Eventgoers could enjoy learning to make a corn husk doll with Darlene Stewart a fifth-generation Peña or join a group of volunteers to play instruments made by Native Americans.

However if you asked seven-year-old Ryley Musial of Vacaville the goats from McQueeney’s Goat Ranch was his favorite stop.

“I was really excited I like feeding the goats” Ryley said.

Gathering at a tent pitched at the center of the park kids inched close to hear the story of cat that learns the importance of listening in “Mr. Cat and the Mat” written by Robert Magarrrell. Having attended children events hosted by the Peña Adobe Historical Society in the past the author was excited to read his story in person.

“I had to remind myself of some of the words because I haven’t been reading it face-to-face” Magarrrell said. “It’s been great to have that human connection face-to-face to see their reactions face-to-face. I’ve loved every moment of it. ”

Tailing their kids throughout the park parents shared a sense of gratitude for an event that gave them a chance to get their kids out of the house and outdoors to enjoy the sunshine.

Russ Gier a Vacaville resident attended with his wife Wanda and their kids Johanna Ava and Melina.

“They (volunteers) did a really good job with the kids having things for them to do and teaching them how to do different things” Russ said.

While the focus was fun opportunities to learn presented themselves by way of the historic Peña Adobe and Mowers-Goheen Museum.

“I learned about the history of this whole area and about the house and everything” Johanna said.

The Giers said that this won’t be the last time they visit Peña Adobe.

“It’s nice to come to a place that’s not so expensive” Wanda said.

“It’s kid friendly yet historical at the same time” Russ added.

And like the virus the financial situation stemming from the pandemic is lingering longer than many expected. To strike back CFOs are taking a page from the private equity playbook and turning to procurement as major lever for EBITDA improvement.

Instead of viewing procurement as a back-office function CFOs are embracing many of the same complex procurement strategies PE firms have relied on for years to make quick improvements in a portfolio company’s finances. Now leaders see what good looks like and more companies are starting to catch on and adopt this fool-proof cost optimization method.

Working alongside their CFOs procurement officers can dramatically improve their company’s EBITDA through procurement-related optimization mitigate risk through supplier resiliency and achieve a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

Speedy procurement changes mean speedy savings

From the very beginning of the massive and unprecedented disruption caused by COVID-19 companies had to look for new avenues to drive savings. Private equity – long known for acting with speed – discovered long ago that procurement strategy is one of the fastest ways to accelerate value in their portfolio companies. Procurement changes can generate savings in months as opposed to revenue growth which can take years. When the pandemic hit PE operators started using procurement as a lever almost immediately while other organizations lagged. But they’re learning.

Over the last decade most PE firms have invested in building operating teams focused on exiting several key strategies often in parallel to generate value focused on both top line (revenue) growth and margin improvement. In an environment where companies are being valued at >12x multiples of EBITDA many private equity operating partners rely on procurement as a key lever to reduce costs. When utilizing this strategy procurement value can be achieved in months and the savings have a direct dollar-for-dollar impact on EBITDA. As an example if a PE-owned portfolio drives $10 million of bottom-line savings this could have a >$100 million impact on the company’s valuation.

Procurement in an inflationary market

Prices on nearly all goods and services from raw materials to labor and transportation services are skyrocketing. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic demand for goods have surged and supply chains are currently strained like never before.

And while it’s recognized that it’s difficult to lower procurement costs at a time of raging inflation private equity operating partners are ensuring their company’s procurement strategies are not solely based on cost and price alone. Rather using a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) approach that includes utilizing demand and process levers has proven to be an effective strategy to counter pricing increases and inflation growth.

As procurement leaders and CFO’s are taking a more aggressive view of procurement’s ability to impact earnings and earnings per share (EPS)—similar to PE’s view of valuation enhancement— below are examples of procurement’s TCO approach within an inflationary market:

Price – With inflation continuing there’s less room to reduce the cost of goods and services. So which pricing levers can help a company achieve the most value for its spend? A full competitive bid incumbent renegotiations extension of a current deal to avoid price increases and protection from future price increases should all be part of one’s procurement toolkit.

Demand – How can an organization influence the demand or need for goods and services? Possibilities include SKU rationalization schedule optimization complexity reduction usage rationalization item substitution or rationalization and demand reduction.

– How can an organization influence the demand or need for goods and services? Possibilities include SKU rationalization schedule optimization complexity reduction usage rationalization item substitution or rationalization and demand reduction. Process – How does a company procure goods or services in a way that maximizes value? Answering that question requires looking at parameters such as order size compliance and lifecycle cost management.

Supplier continuity helps mitigate risk

Beyond cutting costs reducing demand and changing processes we’ve seen a major focus in the last 18 months on supplier continuity programs to mitigate supplier risk. If you can’t rely on key suppliers to fulfill orders for materials you need to make finished goods you cannot drive revenue. When risk management begins in the sourcing stage through identifying and closely managing suppliers threats can be identified early in the process.

To reduce risk they need to broaden their supplier base by identifying new partners including potential second- and third-tier suppliers. Other risk mitigation strategies include moving production to less expensive countries; relocating it to nearby companies to shorten the supply chain; and shifting to JIC (just-in-case) supply chains which involves purchasing in greater volume to maintain extra inventory.

Procurement changes can add up to 40% EBITA improvement

Do these procurement strategies work? The answer is yes.

A 1% decrease in spend will increase EBITDA by more than 1% our experience shows. In most cases a company’s procurement spend is many times its EBITDA so a 10% reduction in spend may improve EBITDA by 20% to 40% improvement. Compare those results to the $5 to $20 in new net sales companies need to generate a single dollar in EBITDA impact. There are few savings levers that offer such a dramatic immediate impact.

Significant cost savings through smart procurement strategies can change that – as can vastly improve procurement data collection and analysis a weak point of many organizations. Savings that make a measurable difference to EBITDA achieve the financial predictability C-level executives are looking for. Alignment between procurement leaders and CFOs can be a company’s greatest weapon in difficult financial times – and help leave competitors in the dust – pandemic or no pandemic.

AMD,Advanced Micro Devices,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vaG93LXRvLXBhc3MtdGhyb3VnaC1wY2llLW5pY3Mtd2l0aC1wcm94bW94LXZlLW9uLWludGVsLWFuZC1hbWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Pass-through PCIe NICs with Proxmox VE on Intel and AMD,"A quick one today is the super-simple tutorial for getting NICs passed through to virtual machines on Promxox VE. Passing-through NICs avoid the hypervisor overhead and also can help with compatibility issues using virtual NICs and some firewall appliances like pfSense and OPNsense. The downside is that unless the NICs support SR-IOV they most likely will not be shared devices in this configuration.

Step 1: BIOS Setup

The first thing one needs to do is to turn on the IOMMU feature on your system. For this the CPU and the platform need to support the feature. These days most platforms will support IOMMU but some older platforms do not. On Intel platforms this is called “VT-d”. That stands for Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d.)

On AMD platforms you will likely see AMD-Vi as the option. Sometimes in different system firmware you will see IOMMU. These are the options you want to enable.

Of course since this is Proxmox VE you will want to ensure your basic virtualization is on as well while you are in the BIOS. Also since it is going to likely be a main focus for people using this guide if you are making a firewall/ router on the machine we usually suggest setting the On AC Power setting to “Always on” or “Last state” so that in the event of a power failure your network comes up immediately.

Next we need to determine if we are using GRUB or systemd as the bootloader.

Step 2: Determine if you are Using GRUB or systemd

This is a newer step but if you install a recent version of Proxmox VE and are using ZFS as the root (this may expand in the future) you likely are using systemd not GRUB. After installation use this command to determine which you are using:

efibootmgr -v

If you see something like “File(\EFI\SYSTEMD\SYSTEMD-BOOTX64.EFI)” then you are using systemd not GRUB.

Another giveaway is when you boot if you see a blue screen with GRUB and a number of options just before going into the OS then you are using GRUB. If you see something like this you are using systemd:

This is important because many older guides are using GRUB but if you are using systemd and follow the GRUB instructions you will not enable IOMMU needed for NIC pass-through.

Step 3a: Enable IOMMU using GRUB

If you have GRUB and most installations today will then you will need to edit your configuration file:

nano /etc/default/grub

For Intel CPUs add quiet intel_iommu=on:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""quiet intel_iommu=on""

For AMD CPUs add quiet amd_iommu=on:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""quiet amd_iommu=on""

Here is a screenshot with the intel line to show you where to put it:

Optionally one can also add IOMMU PT mode. PT mode improves the performance of other PCIe devices in the system when passthrough is being used. This works on Intel and AMD CPUs and is iommu=pt. Here is the AMD version of what would be added and we will have an Intel screenshot following:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""quiet amd_iommu=on iommu=pt""

Here is the screenshot of where this goes:

Remember to save and exit.

Now we need to update GRUB:

update-grub

Now to go Step 4.

Step 3a: Enable IOMMU using systemd

If in Step 2 you found you were using systemd then adding bits to GRUB will not work. Instead here is what to do:

nano /etc/kernel/cmdline

For Intel CPUs add:

quiet intel_iommu=on

For AMD CPUs add:

quiet amd_iommu=on

Here is a screenshot of where to add this using the Intel version:

Optionally one can also add IOMMU PT mode. This works on Intel and AMD CPUs and is iommu=pt. Here is the AMD version of what would be added and we will have an Intel screenshot following:

quiet amd_iommu=on iommu=pt

Here is the Intel screenshot:

Now we need to refresh our boot tool.

proxmox-boot-tool refresh

Now go to Step 4.

Step 4: Add Modules

Many will immediately reboot after the above is done and it is probably a good practice. Usually I like to add modules just to save time. If you are more conservative reboot then do this step. Next you will want to add modules by editing:

nano /etc/modules

In that file you will want to add:

vfio vfio_iommu_type1 vfio_pci vfio_virqfd

Here is what it should look like:

Next you can reboot.

Step 5: Reboot

This is a big enough change that you will want to reboot next. With PVE a tip we have is to reboot often when setting up the base system. You do not want to spend hours building a configuration then find out it does not boot and you are unsure of why.

We will quickly note that we condensed the above a bit for more modern systems. If something fails in the verify step below you may want to reboot before adding modules instead and also not turn on PT mode before rebooting.

Step 7: Verify Everything is Working

This is the command you will want to use:

dmesg | grep -e DMAR -e IOMMU

Depending on the system which options you have and so forth a lot of the output is going to change here. What you are looking for is the line highlighted in the screenshot DMAR: IOMMU enabled:

If you have that you are likely in good shape.

Step 7: Configure Proxmox VE VMs to Use NICs

For this we are using a little box very similar to the Inexpensive 4x 2.5GbE Fanless Router Firewall Box Review. It is essentially the same just a different version of that box. One of the nice features is that each NIC is its own i225-V and we can pass through each individual NIC to a VM. Here is a screenshot from an upcoming video we have:

In the old days adding a pass-through NIC to a VM was done via CLI editing. Now Proxmox pulls the PCIe device ID and then also the device vendor and name. This makes it very easy to pick NICs in a system. One point that is nice about many of the onboard NICs is that the physical ordering as the NICs are labeled on the system should mean that we have sequential MAC addresses and PCIe IDs. In the above 0000:01:00.0 is the first NIC (ETH0). The device 0000:02:00.0 is the second and so forth.

At this point you are already done. You can see we have this working on both OPNsense and pfSense and the process is very similar. The nice thing is that by doing this pfSense/ OPNsense have direct access to the NICs instead of using a virtualized NIC device.

A Few Notes on IOMMU with pfSense and OPNsense

After these NICs are assigned there are a few key considerations that are important to keep in mind:

Using a pass-through NIC will make it so the VM will not live migrate. If a VM expects a physical NIC at a PCIe location and it does not get it that will be an issue.

Conceptually there is a more advanced feature called SR-IOV that allows you to pass through a NIC to multiple devices. For lower-end i210 and i225-V NICs that we commonly see in pfSense and OPNsense appliances you will be conceptually dedicating the NIC to the VM. That means another VM cannot use the NIC. Here is an example where we have the pfSense VM (600) using a NIC that is also assigned to the OPNsense NIC. We get an error trying to start OPNsense. The Proxmox VE GUI will allow you to configure pass-through on both VMs if they are off but only one can be on and active with the dedicated NIC at a time.

Older hardware may not have IOMMU capabilities. Newer hardware has both IOMMU and ACS so most newer platforms make it easy to separate PCIe devices and dedicate them to VMs. On older hardware sometimes how PCIe devices are grouped causes issues if you want to as in this example pass-through NICs separately to different VMs.

You can utilize both virtual NICs on bridges along with dedicated pass-through NICs in the same VM.

At 1GbE speeds pass-through is not as big of a difference compared to using virtualized NICs. At 25GbE/ 100GbE speeds it becomes a very large difference.

When we discuss DPUs one of the key differences is that the DPU can handle features like bridging virtual network ports to physical high-speed ports and that happens all on the DPU rather than the host CPU.

This is an area where it takes longer to setup than a bare-metal installation and it adds complexity to a pfSense or OPNsense installation. The benefit one gets is that doing things like reboots is usually much faster in the virtual machine. One can also snapshot the pfSense or OPNsense image in the event one makes a breaking change.

We suggest having at least one more NIC in the system for Proxmox VE management and other VM features. If one uses pass-through for all NICs to firewall VMs then there will not be a system NIC.

This is probably not exhaustive but hopefully this helps.

Final Words

This is a quick guide to setting up a PCIe pass-through NIC on Proxmox VE for when you are virtualizing pfSense OPNsense or another solution. It is more geared towards newer hardware made since 2017 or 2020 so if you have an older system there may be more tweaking required. This used to be a feature that companies like Intel used for heavy segmentation for its chips in markets but most will support VT-d these days.

Most of the nominated acts boycotted the ceremony and were met with industry-wide support. In the years following the Grammys have been a Hip-Hop controversy hot-bed whether artists decide to speak out against the lack of mutual camaraderie between the culture and the Recording Academy top-selling emcees absent from nomination lists and without a win on their resumes or a mindblowing win (see Macklemore beating Kendrick Lamar in 2014).

Porsche has been making 911-based spec racers since Carrera Cup Germany began in the 1980s. It quickly became a global phenomenon with 911 GT3 Cup-based categories now racing in a dozen markets worldwide. At the very top of that ladder is the Carrera Supercup that follows Formula 1 through Europe and at the very beginning of the Carrera Supercup is a field of 964-based cars that debuted in the 1993 season. One year later a new 3.8-liter variant based on the 993-generation 911 debuted. Only 35 of those air cooled racers were produced in that spec. This is one of those cars.

Although it is an actual race car this specific 993 Supercup did not race at the top level of spec sports car racing. Instead it served as a pace car throughout that 1994 season before being sold into private ownership ahead of the 1995 season. It was raced at the club level throughout its life after that but it never lost the original bodywork and paint it wore as a pace car.

This being a 993-based Carrera Cup car it is an air-cooled naturally-aspirated 911 race car. It being one built in the mid-1990s it also features a six-speed manual transaxle. That makes it just about as desirable a track car as any in the world.

In this market it also makes this car exceptionally valuable. Bidding on Bring a Trailer is up to $169993 with three days remaining.

Reggie Miller doesn't cross the country for everyone he's ever worked with.

But the Indiana Pacers' all-time leading scorer wouldn't miss this sendoff.

Senior media advisor David Benner is retiring after the season and the team honored him before Sunday's game against the Detroit Pistons.

In a surprise Miller showed up at midcourt at the end of the recognition.

Monumental moment for Benner: Jordan returns from retirement against the Pacers

Miller and Benner developed a routine over their course of Miller's career. Before a game Benner would stand courtside and Miller would walk over to him to jokingly chastise Benner pointing a finger close to Benner's face.

Of course they had to recreate that Sunday.

Benner covered the Pacers for IndyStar before joining the franchise 28 years ago.

But on a rainy day or a lazy evening after a day of sightseeing sometimes a good streaming TV session is in order.

Enter Roku. You may have noticed that many vacation rentals are equipped with a Roku. And the ones that aren't well they probably should be. How do Airbnb hosts choose which streaming platform to use? We don't recommend putting an expensive Apple TV box in that cozy beachside cottage. A Chromecast with Google TV or an Amazon Fire TV are options too but a Roku is our top choice for people with vacation rentals thanks to these devices' affordable price ease of use and convenient guest mode.

Here's why so many Airbnbs come with Roku devices and why we think it's the best choice for vacation rental hosts. And if you're a host yourself read on for three reasons we think you should take our advice.

Read more: Best Roku to Buy in 2022

1. Roku devices are inexpensive

First off Roku smart TVs and streaming devices offer great value -- a small Roku TV costs less than $200. If you want to splurge and create a more luxe experience for your guests you can buy a larger Roku TV model. Our favorite Roku TV is from TCL but Roku smart TV models are also available from other brands.

Roku has numerous streaming devices that work with any TV but our pick is the Roku Express 4K Plus. It costs between $30 and $40 and has basically everything you need in a streamer. It's the cheapest Roku with a remote that can also control any TV meaning guests don't have to juggle clickers.

The most basic streaming device is the Roku Express available for $25. Though it lacks 4K and the voice control feature of its siblings it's easy to install with an HDMI cable. The downside is that there is no TV control on the remote so we think stepping up to the Express 4K Plus is worth it.

The $30 Roku Voice Remote Pro is also worth considering. It can be added to any Roku streamer or TV and provides a few more guest-friendly perks the coolest being the remote finder. If the remote gets lost -- which can easily happen when there's a steady stream of guests coming in and out -- you can pinpoint its location by simply calling out to it. The Pro remote also has a headphone jack so guests can watch their favorite shows or movies without disturbing others.

2. Roku's system is the easiest to use

Though Amazon Fire TV and Chromecast options are also reasonably priced Roku has them beat for simplicity. Roku devices operate smoothly and are a snap to set up but the best part is the intuitive interface on the main screen. Guests of any age can easily navigate to apps by clicking icons for Hulu Spotify HBO Max Apple TV Plus or Disney Plus.

Roku's simple grid of apps wins over the rest. Compared with Amazon's clunky (and mildly infuriating) search process for Prime Video content it's a cinch to find titles or genres on a Roku. And Chromecast with Google TV has a home menu that focuses on the content rather than on the streaming apps themselves so it can get cluttered with shows and movies guests might not find relevant.

3. Roku Guest Mode is a host's best friend

Hosts who don't want to share their login credentials with visitors can activate Guest Mode (formerly known as Auto Sign Out Mode) on any Roku TV or streaming player. This feature allows guests to sign in to their own subscriptions for services like Netflix Sling or Hulu. Guest Mode can be enabled for any Roku-linked device in any room of your rental property. Airbnb hosts on Reddit give it the thumbs-up over competitors.

In order to set up this feature you'll need to add a PIN to your Roku account first and then launch it either directly on the device or from a remote location. Because the PIN is attached to the owner's personal account guests won't be able to access the owner's profile to watch content or make purchases.

Once guests click on Guest Mode they'll be prompted to enter a sign-off date which means Roku will automatically log them out of the account when they leave. They also have the option to sign out manually anytime before their departure date. In either case their login credentials will be removed from the system.

The home screen has default channels such as Netflix and Prime Video but guests can add channels or stream from their personal Roku library. If they forget to log out at the end of their stay the host can do it for them.

Google Chromecast devices offer a guest mode but it's not as sophisticated as Roku's -- it's mainly designed to let people more easily cast from their phones to the TV. Fire TV devices require an Amazon account to work although you can set up a PIN to prevent purchases.

And because Roku devices are inexpensive it may not hurt as much if a guest decides to snatch the host's when they leave. At least you can disable access from any location in the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8va3V0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tYW4td2hvLWF0dGVuZGVkLWRyYXBlci1haXJibmItaG91c2UtcGFydHktcmVjYWxscy1zaG90cy1maXJlZC1pbi1kZWFkbHktc2hvb3RpbmfSAXFodHRwczovL2t1dHYuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21hbi13aG8tYXR0ZW5kZWQtZHJhcGVyLWFpcmJuYi1ob3VzZS1wYXJ0eS1yZWNhbGxzLXNob3RzLWZpcmVkLWluLWRlYWRseS1zaG9vdGluZw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man who attended Draper Airbnb house party recalls shots fired in deadly shooting,"Investigations continued Sunday evening after  outside a party at a rented house in Draper early Sunday morning

Police were still searching for the suspect who has been described as a stocky Hispanic man with face tattoos.

One of the attendees said he heard about the party in Draper from a friend and decided to attend. When he was leaving with two friends he said he heard arguing and then the gun shots.

ALSO:

“I think it started from throwing beer bottles — that’s literally it"" said the man who asked to have his name withheld. ""Something so small caused something so big.""

When it happened he said he moved to protect his friends but a man standing nearby was hit.

“So then I pulled them down"" he said. ""I couldn’t pull him down fast enough.""

In that moment the individual said he felt lucky.

MORE:

“I lucked out because we were right next to each other"" he said.

The man said he checked on his friends and tried to help the man who was hit.

“After that I was just trying to keep him alive with whatever we knew to do"" he said.



He said he saw another man had been shot sitting in a Tesla nearby.

ALSO:

Neighbors like Daniel Conder heard the gunshots and called 911.

“We look out they’re doing CPR on some guy and there’s cars fleeing the scene"" he said.

Conder's son Zachary pulled up seemingly seconds after shots were fired.

“I’m trying to get home. My first thought is I need to call 911 because I see someone on the ground getting CPR"" Zachary said. ""I see blood I’m not sure what’s going on but it’s kind of scary.”

He said he was nearly hit by a car trying to leave the area.

MORE:

Airbnb said they have removed the booking guest from their platform deactivated the listing while they investigate and are offering their assistance to Draper police.



The individual who attended the party came back to the street Sunday to get his car. He said he’s trying to keep how close he came to getting hurt out of his head.

“Really lucky but I try not to think about it"" he said. ""You can only lookout so many times.”

Airbnb provided 2News the following statement Sunday:



We join the Draper community in condemning this senseless gun violence. We ban parties and we have removed the booking guest from our platform as we conduct a thorough investigation. We have also reached out to the leadership of the Draper Police Department to offer our assistance as they work to find the person responsible for this criminal act.

A 2020 article in The New York Times highlighted “their chairs their dozens of experimental movies or their famous house on the Pacific Ocean” as key elements of their collaborative work. But the full scope of their work remains vast the subject of museum shows and biographical analyses.



And now they’re getting a new nonprofit dedicated to their work — with the couple’s granddaughter Llisa Demetrios on board as chief curator. As a new article in Designboom points out initial funding for the memorably named Eames Institute of Infinite Curiosity comes from Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia.



The Eames Institute’s website offers more information on the project which also incorporates a new magazine Kazam! named for the machine that was key to the look of some of their signature furniture.

In practice this also includes everything from an in-depth online exhibition looking at the Eames’s lives and work to a working ranch that also houses an abundance of items created by the Eameses.



In a Kazam! article the organization’s president and CEO John Cary explained the genesis of the project. “The Eameses’ vision remains relevant today for what it stirs within us; their work is compelling because they found in everyday objects and materials the inspiration to shape a new perspective new forms new purpose” Cary writes. It has all the makings of a welcome resource for those who like their design and their theory to converge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kbnJvbmxpbmUuY29tL2Rucm9ubGluZS9jb3VudHktc2Vlcy1zdGVhZHktaW5jcmVhc2UtaW4tc2hvcnQtdGVybS1yZW50YWwtcHJvcGVydGllcy9hcnRpY2xlXzZhOGViYmEwLWZlMzUtNTZlOS1hOGZmLWU2NmUzMWUyZjliMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,County Sees 'Steady Increase' In Short-Term Rental Properties,No subscription is required to sign up for News-Record newsletters.

One of the biggest challenges for Ukrainian refugees is finding affordable housing and Nova Ukraine is teaming up with Airbnb's nonprofit Airbnb.org to help out.

PALO ALTO Calif. (KGO) -- As millions of Ukrainians flee their country the Bay Area is bracing to welcome a portion of the 100000 refugees set to land in the U.S.

""We are on the edge of our seats just like everyone else knowing that and anticipating that we could see large numbers of folks"" said Robin Mencher Executive Director Jewish Family & Community Services.

The East Bay-based refugee resettlement agency is readying itself and counting on the community to stop up again.

""We saw it really kick into gear this last August with the Afghan evacuation"" said Mencher noting the agency's helped settle more than 500 Afghans with more than 200 set to arrive in the coming months.

TAKE ACTION: Local and national support for people in Ukraine

The Bay Area community has been helping with financial donations and more.

""Everything from diapers to Chromebooks to dishes and everything in between"" said Mencher ""to providing necessary services like transportation or language translation.""

One of the biggest challenges is finding affordable housing for newcomers and Nova Ukraine is teaming up with Airbnb.org to help out.

""So many ordinary people are reaching out to Nova Ukraine offering their home so this is a great systematic way to create a database of people who are in a position to offer help"" Yulia Zimmermann with Nova Ukraine said noting you don't have to be an Airbnb host to offer up space. You can simply go to Airbnb.org - the company's charitable website - and sign up to open up your home.

Bay Area nonprofit Transform a Street Dog has saved hundreds of dogs from Ukraine and has no plans of stopping.

Airbnb.org will also be providing vouchers to partners like Nova Ukraine as part of its commit to help resettle 100000 Ukrainian refugees worldwide.

""These nonprofits can also just book regular supplies on the Airbnb platform as well - whatever best meets their needs we will cover the cost of that.""

If you'd like to donate to the voucher program you can do that as well at Airbnb.org.

""Airbnb and other short term rental opportunities are really critical because when the volume of folks is really high it's almost impossible to get people their first night from the airport into their home - their new apartment rental makes all the difference"" said Mencher.

Members of the Lake Geneva City Council unanimously approved a conditional use permit March 28 to allow the second floor of the Dungeon Hobby Shop Museum 723 Williams St. to operate as a commercial indoor lodging facility.

The plan commission members unanimously approved the permit March 21.

The second floor of the museum is set to be operated as a short-term rental facility and will include two bedrooms and an in-suite kitchen with two assigned parking spaces available for guests.

Attorney Timothy Brovold representing the owners of the Dungeon Hobby Shop Museum said guests will be welcome to visit the museum and participate in any games that may be held at the museum.

“The purpose would be to allow guests to stay upstairs then come downstairs and view the Dungeons & Dragons museum and allow them to stay and check out the museum and do game playing” Brovold said. “There is a big push for that and people who want to do that.”

City council members unanimously approved June 28 2021 to rezone the property from general business district to central business district to allow the museum to be established.

The council members also unanimously approved June 28 2021 to allow a commercial apartment to be established on the second floor of the building to serve as a residential space for the curator of the museum.

Brovold said the curator is no longer residing at the facility which is part of the reason the museum owners decided to use the space as a short-term rental facility.

“It’s already set up really for this purpose with the two bedrooms” Brovold said. “They put in the parking lot last year also along those lines and made all the parking space requirements.”

Jackie Mich associate planner for Vanderwalle & Associates Inc. said the museum owners have met all the requirements for the second level of the building to be operated as a short-term rental facility.

“This is basically a change of use going from a commercial apartment to a commercial lodging land use on the second floor” Mich said. “We have two parking spaces provided onsite which would be sufficient for the commercial indoor lodging. Because this business is zoned central business there is additional parking requirements for the hobby shop museum. From a zoning standpoint they are covered in terms of parking.”

The Dungeon Hobby Shop Museum which opened in July 2021 features books artifacts games and memorabilia related to Dungeons & Dragons.

The Geneva Lake Museum 255 Mill St. in Lake Geneva is in the process of establishing a Dungeons & Dragons-themed exhibit entitled “A Legacy of Imagination. The Creation of a Culture.”

Lake Geneva often is referred to as the “birth place of Dungeons & Dragons.”

Co-founder Gary Gygax developed the idea for the fantasy role playing game at his former home at 330 Center St. which in recent years has also been rented out for overnight stays and game days.

Coach K retires with a record 1202 wins five NCAA titles and a robust bank account.

Duke hired Krzyzewski in 1980 after five seasons at Army and his paycheck soared as he racked up Final Four trips—13 in all but only three since 2004. Duke University tax returns show that the coach earned at least $87 million over the two decades from 2000 through June 2020. Add in his first 20 years on the job along with his pay the past two seasons—filings are not available yet—and Coach K earned more than $100 million while in Durham. In addition he’s pocketed millions pitching for Allstate American Express Chevrolet Nike and more.

Duke has also contributed to the Emily K Center a nonprofit founded by Coach K and named after his mother to help students from populations often underrepresented in higher education. The annual grant in the most recently available tax filings was $228500.

Krzyzewski earned $7.3 million from Duke during the 2019-20 season and his total compensation peaked at $9.7 million for 2011-12. He fell outside of Sportico’s ranking last year of the highest-paid coaches across all U.S. sports based on average salary. In college basketball only John Calipari cracked the top 25 at No. 15 with $8.6 million. Seven NBA coaches made the cut led by Gregg Popovich at $11.5 million.

Krzyzewski was offered chances to make the NBA leap multiple times including a bid by the Boston Celtics in 1990. He turned down the Los Angeles Lakers in 2004 despite a reported offer of $40 million over five years. After Mikhail Prokhorov bought the Nets in 2010 he was rumored to want Coach K and was willing to make him the sport’s highest-paid coach at up to $15 million a year.

While he never coached in the NBA Krzyzewski had an outsized impact on the league. He has had nearly 70 players selected in the NBA Draft including 42 first-round picks and three top selections overall. He got a taste of coaching its players as an assistant for the 1992 Dream Team and later as head coach of the U.S. national team which he led to three Olympic gold medals. Not the only gold for the Hall of Fame coach.

–With assistance from Daniel Libit",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbXlkYWtvdGFuLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0L2NoYW5nZXMtb24tY29sbGVnZS1jYW1wdXMtd2l0aC1uYW1lLWltYWdlLWFuZC1saWtlbmVzcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Changes on College Campus with Name Image and Likeness,"Very few divisive topics have hit centered stage more in college athletics than allowing players to receive financial compensation for their play. For years the NCAA has argued that paying players transcends the athletes from amateurs to professionals. This has changed with the new Name Image and Likeness (NIL) rule added to the NCAA this year. Athletes are not specifically being paid while a weekly or monthly check like professional athletes but they can receive financial compensation through the usage of their Name Image and Likeness. This means all college athletes are allowed to make money through their promotion and branding with companies.

When the rule first came out many believed only major Division I athletes from big football and men’s basketball programs would benefit from the NIL rule. At most DI universities usually only football and men’s basketball programs make money. It would make sense that only the high-profile football and men’s basketball players would have a brand big enough to earn NIL opportunities. That is not the case however; all levels of NCAA athletes can receive compensation. It was recently released that 4 of the 5 highest NIL value at this year’s Final Four players in March Madness are women’s basketball players.

Division II athletes are also allowed to receive NIL opportunities they may not be as big as some of the DI athletes are receiving but these deals can have a big impact on these athletes. Barstool Sports has started a campaign allowing all levels of college athletes to apply to become a Barstool Athlete. Several athletes at Minot State have been given opportunities to sign an NIL deal this year myself included.

I was fortunate enough to sign 2 NIL deals. For my 2021 AFCA Allstate Good Works Team selection I was given the opportunity to do a social media campaign with Allstate and AFCA to promote the award and in return I was financially compensated. There are also local NIL opportunities here in Minot. For being named the United Community Bank and Scheels Community Athlete Spotlight I was given a smaller NIL deal with Scheels. It was a much smaller financial compensation but even a little bit can go a long way for college athletes.

With NIL in full effect the compliance office for is one of the best resources athletes have to gain a full understanding of NIL and maximize their opportunities. When the rule passed the NCAA put out universal restrictions and then tasked each university with setting their own guidelines. At Minot State Madeline Schorlemmer the Assistant Director of Athletics Compliance and Student Life is the major resource for MSU athletes when it comes to NIL.

“The Minot State Athletic Department developed a NIL Policy which mirrors many of our conference schools and can be found on msubeavers.com. This policy outlines the do’s and don’ts of NIL opportunities. Our student-athletes need to be aware that there are still NCAA policies in place that NIL does not condone such as pay-for play inducement and partnerships with gambling/sports wagering vendors. In addition per Minot State’s policy NIL compensation opportunities must not conflict with academic or team related activities nor can our student-athletes utilize our athletic facilities to promote their NIL opportunity. Additional institutional restrictions can be found in our NIL policy online” Schorlemmer explained.

As NIL begins to gain traction there are several things athletes should consider before signing any deals and Schorlemmer is the resource MSU athletes should look to first.

“It’s important that student-athletes pursue opportunities that they are passionate about. NIL opportunities should not feel like extra work nor should they cause more stress on a student-athlete’s day-to-day life. In addition it’s important that they fully understand the NIL opportunity before signing a contract. At the end of the day they are still a student-athlete representing themselves and their institution and must follow all policy” Schorlemmer said “Prior to signing a NIL opportunity it is encouraged that the student-athlete meet with the Compliance office. Although Minot State employees are prohibited from assisting student-athletes in the negotiation of NIL agreements and cannot facilitate any communication between student-athletes and a party seeking an NIL agreement the compliance office is more than willing to read through any NIL contract to confirm if the NIL activity follows all policy.”

My NIL deals were both one-time deals that went along with awards I was nominated for. On the other hand several other athletes on campus have signed long term NIL deals. Two of those athletes include Minot State Baseball player and pitcher RJ Martinez and Minot State Track and Field Thrower Leif Nelson.

“My NIL is with Liquid IV. They are a hydration company and my deal includes me posting them on social media twice a month and I get free liquid IV packages every month” Martinez explained “got in contact via Instagram. They then had me fill out a form and got in contact with me to tell me I was accepted.”





Nelsons NIL deal is also with a hydration company and got in contact with his deal in a similar way to Martinez.

“My NIL is with Body Armor and what the deal entails is if I post on my social media promoting their products they send me free drinks” Nelson explained “How I got in contact with Body Armor is through Instagram direct messages.”

Nelson was a part of the majority who though NIL deals were only for major DI athletes.

“My initial reaction was I didn't think I had enough followers to get a company to sponsor me. A few weeks later I heard of my teammate getting sponsored so I talked to him about how he did it” Nelson said.

With NIL in full effect for student athletes both Martinez and Nelson have seen the importance of NIL; however they see the importance in different ways.

“I think it is important because you are finally able to do something good with your own 'brand.' You can find good companies that will help you out and take care of you” Martinez said.

“NIL is important because it's a way for college athletes to get paid. Most of the time college athletes don't have time to get a job during the school year and if they aren't on full scholarship they need income to pay for school” said Nelson.

Martinez and Nelson are far from the only athletes on campus with NIL deals Nelson has several teammates who also have Body Armor deals. For the athletes who have not signed a deal Martinez encourages them to look into potential NIL opportunities.

“If you are a student athlete you should try and reach out to any company that aligns with your morals and standards and find a company to partner with to create something bigger than yourself” Martinez said.

NIL is not even a year old in college athletics and has already had a big impact on the NCAA. As the rule continues to ripple within the NCAA and more athletes get in contact with brands it will be interesting see how it shapes the future of college athletics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3JleS1teXN0ZXJpby13cmVzdGxlbWFuaWEtZG9taW5pay9hcnRpY2xlNjUyODA2NzAuZWNl0gFhaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHUuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvcmV5LW15c3RlcmlvLXdyZXN0bGVtYW5pYS1kb21pbmlrL2FydGljbGU2NTI4MDY3MC5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Standing out in a world of giants: Rey Mysterio on completing 20 years in WWE Wrestlemania 38 and more,"April 01 2022 10:48 pm | Updated April 02 2022 01:03 pm IST

Over 17000 people thronged the Allstate Arena at Rosemount Illinois. It is the 22nd edition of Wrestlemania an event the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) hypes up as the grandest stage of them all. Kurt Angle is defending his World Heavyweight Championship title against Randy Orton and Rey Mysterio. With Orton down Angle attempts Angle Slam one of his signature moves on Mysterio. The latter counters – he slips from Angle’s shoulder locks his left elbow with Angle’s and brings him down. Mysterio then quickly recovers to dropkick Orton onto the middle rope. He connects his signature move – the 619 which is a swinging kick between the ropes. Next he jumps from the top rope on Orton and pins him.

One two three.

The crowd erupts. Mysterio collects the championship belt from the referee hugs it like it is his lost-and-found baby and displays it to the crowd standing on the middle turnbuckle. His mask barely hides his emotions.

Mysterio in a recent video call with The Hindu fondly recalled that Wrestlemania night 16 years ago when he became one of the shortest wrestlers ever to win the world title. It he said was the most defining moment of his 20-year WWE career.

“That was an important obstacle I crossed. That opened up doors for other wrestlers of my size and style of wrestling” he said.

WWE has always been a giants’ world. Close your eyes and think of five high-profile WWE wrestlers that come to mind. Chances are that most (or even all) of them are six feet tall or more. Mysterio at 5’6’ (shorter than an average American male) stood out in a roster mostly filled with big brawny men. It was not that WWE did not see short wrestlers before Mysterio but none of them went to accomplish things that he did inside the ring. He has won all the major titles in WWE outlasted 29 other wrestlers to win the Royal Rumble in 2006 as the No. 2 entrant and has been a fan favourite for two decades.

Mysterio is especially proud of popularising the ‘Lucha Libre’ – Mexican freestyle wrestling. “A few people including me brought the Lucha style to WCW (World Championship Wrestling the company started by Ted Turner)” he says “It was suddenly seen worldwide. The fans were like ‘Wow what is this? This is really cool.’ That kind of moulded the generation that came right after us. You can see a change in their style of wrestling – you can see the influence of Lucha.”

Mysterio started his career in 1989 when he was just 14. He was already a star when he made his WWE debut. Very few WWE stars have had careers as long as his. He admits however that his journey has not been easy.

“There was definitely a moment of exhaustion. I had been going non-stop since my debut. I was tired I was homesick I didn’t know if I had the energy to keep going at that level. So (taking a break from WWE) was the best thing I could have done.”

Mysterio ended his WWE hiatus in 2018. A year later his son Dominik made his debut. Dominik is a third-generation wrestler from the Mysterio family. “There’s a lot of respect the name Mysterio has earned over the years. Because of that and the way my son conducts himself backstage a lot of other wrestlers including his peers pull him aside to advise him” adds Mysterio.

The father-son duo will be in action at WrestleMania 38. On April 2 or 3 they will face Logan Paul and The Miz in a tag team match. It will be a significant moment in both their careers.

“WrestleMania is one event you don’t want to miss whether you are a WWE wrestler or fan. It is that time of the year we all wait for. It has witnessed some amazing moments over the years.”

There have been record numbers of new investors entering the market in the past two years fueled by a variety of factors not least of which is the greater ease and lower cost of doing so.

According to a recent survey by Investing.com 86% of new investors in 2021 plan to increase their stock holdings in 2022 not scared off by the fact the market has been down sharply since last November.

Not overreacting to market volatility is indeed a good lesson already learned. The market downturn has brought down valuations of many high-quality companies making it a good time to buy. Given the fact most new investors are younger and unafraid to take more risky positions according to the survey there's one exchange-traded fund in particular that jumps out as a great option for new investors -- the Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC 1.60%).

Investing in a broad swath of the IT market

The Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF is not a small fund by any stretch of the imagination with some $6.4 billion in net assets. But it's far less popular than its larger rivals the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund which are each hovering around $50 billion in assets. All three are great funds but let's look at why the Fidelity fund may be the best option for a new investor.

The Fidelity ETF tracks the MSCI USA IMI Information Technology 25/50 Index one of the broadest benchmarks used for technology-sector ETFs. The IMI in the index's name stands for ""investable market index"" which means it draws from the entire universe of IT -- large mid and small-cap names. Then it applies certain limits and screens to ensure diversification. The result is a fund that holds about 367 stocks including software companies information technology firms and technology hardware and equipment companies.

However it does not include three notable names -- Amazon Meta Platforms and Alphabet -- as they are categorized as communication services or retailers. But it does include Apple Microsoft and Nvidia -- its three largest holdings.

Why this ETF stands out for new investors

There are a few primary reasons why this ETF stands out for new investors. It invests in a sector that has produced some of the best long-term returns on the market: technology. If you're a new investor and have a long time horizon for your holdings you can afford to be more aggressive and invest in a sector that may have more short-term volatility (see the current market) but typically produces excellent long-term returns.

This ETF which launched in 2013 has returned 21.9% per year since its inception as of Feb. 28. Over the last five years it has returned 25.5% on an annualized basis. And in the past 12 months as of March 31 it's up 18.2% despite shedding over 9% year to date. Those are very good results among the best in its category comparable to its aforementioned larger brethren.

Another reason to like it compared to other technology-focused ETFs is its broad diversification within the sector which gives it a lower standard deviation -- a measure of performance volatility -- than many of its competitors.

The two other factors are its expenses and its price. The Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF has the lowest expense ratio in its class just 0.08%. That means the investor pays just $0.80 per year for every $1000 invested.

Finally the ETF is currently priced at about $123 per share which is among the lowest in its class. If you're a new investor and don't have a ton of capital to invest you may find this price level more accessible while still enjoying strong performance at a low cost."

According to the data on The Quantum Insider’s proprietary data platform D-Wave and MagiQ are the oldest pure quantum technology companies (as in founded specifically for that purpose) in existence both founded in 1999. However if you really want to knit pick you can find companies working with quantum/quantum computing technology these days that were founded prior to these enterprises’ existence such as Toptica (1998) Kelvin Nanotechnology (1997) FormFactor (1993) IronCap (1992) Cryofab (1971) and even Oxford Instruments which was founded way back in 1959!

This is without even talking about the large multinationals like IBM (1911) Intel (1968) Microsoft (1975) and Google (1998) that are the major players (along with several others) in the space in 2022.

This brings us to the focus of today’s article two companies founded in 2022 the Chinese Year of the Tiger.

Whether this founding year will be lucky for them is anyone’s guess; yet with the trajectory the quantum technology industry is heading all the signs look positive.

If you want to learn more we’ve compiled the most comprehensive list of the top quantum computing companies available!

Let’s do it then:

1. OklahomaQuantum Inc.

Based out of Norman Oklahoma OklahomaQuantum Inc. designs and manufactures Quantum inertial sensors that provide position when GPS is unavailable. Used in many industries such as autonomous vehicles submarines aircraft and spacecraft Quantum inertial sensors can provide near-absolute accuracy of acceleration because atoms are extremely sensitive to their environment. However quantum technology has many shortcomings to be put into practical use. OklahomaQauntum is developing a quantum inertial sensor that is highly integrated and compact for navigation.

Founded by CEO Saesun Kim a tech entrepreneur and winner of the international quantum hackathon hosted by Creative Destruction Lab — whose graduate work on generating atomic resonance quantum light has been selected as Editor’s Pick at the Optics letter — Kim also serves as co-lead of the IBM Qiskit localization project for an open-source project.

There have been record numbers of new investors entering the market in the past two years fueled by a variety of factors not least of which is the greater ease and lower cost of doing so.

According to a recent survey by Investing.com 86% of new investors in 2021 plan to increase their stock holdings in 2022 not scared off by the fact the market has been down sharply since last November.

Not overreacting to market volatility is indeed a good lesson already learned. The market downturn has brought down valuations of many high-quality companies making it a good time to buy. Given the fact most new investors are younger and unafraid to take more risky positions according to the survey there's one exchange-traded fund in particular that jumps out as a great option for new investors -- the Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC 1.60%).

Investing in a broad swath of the IT market

The Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF is not a small fund by any stretch of the imagination with some $6.4 billion in net assets. But it's far less popular than its larger rivals the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund which are each hovering around $50 billion in assets. All three are great funds but let's look at why the Fidelity fund may be the best option for a new investor.

The Fidelity ETF tracks the MSCI USA IMI Information Technology 25/50 Index one of the broadest benchmarks used for technology-sector ETFs. The IMI in the index's name stands for ""investable market index"" which means it draws from the entire universe of IT -- large mid and small-cap names. Then it applies certain limits and screens to ensure diversification. The result is a fund that holds about 367 stocks including software companies information technology firms and technology hardware and equipment companies.

However it does not include three notable names -- Amazon Meta Platforms and Alphabet -- as they are categorized as communication services or retailers. But it does include Apple Microsoft and Nvidia -- its three largest holdings.

Why this ETF stands out for new investors

There are a few primary reasons why this ETF stands out for new investors. It invests in a sector that has produced some of the best long-term returns on the market: technology. If you're a new investor and have a long time horizon for your holdings you can afford to be more aggressive and invest in a sector that may have more short-term volatility (see the current market) but typically produces excellent long-term returns.

This ETF which launched in 2013 has returned 21.9% per year since its inception as of Feb. 28. Over the last five years it has returned 25.5% on an annualized basis. And in the past 12 months as of March 31 it's up 18.2% despite shedding over 9% year to date. Those are very good results among the best in its category comparable to its aforementioned larger brethren.

Another reason to like it compared to other technology-focused ETFs is its broad diversification within the sector which gives it a lower standard deviation -- a measure of performance volatility -- than many of its competitors.

The two other factors are its expenses and its price. The Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF has the lowest expense ratio in its class just 0.08%. That means the investor pays just $0.80 per year for every $1000 invested.

Finally the ETF is currently priced at about $123 per share which is among the lowest in its class. If you're a new investor and don't have a ton of capital to invest you may find this price level more accessible while still enjoying strong performance at a low cost."

Amazon workers on New York's Staten Island just made history becoming the first group to vote in favor of unionizing at a U.S. facility operated by the country's largest e-commerce company. After a hard-fought battle the result is a major defeat for Amazon which has used all of its might to keep organized labor off its premises. As of Friday the tally at the Staten Island warehouse known as JFK8 was 2654 votes in favor of joining the union and 2131 opposed with 67 ballots being challenged. The fulfillment center doesn't flip to becoming a union shop overnight and there's potentially a long road ahead. But the wheels are in motion for change. Here's what happens next:

Delays challenges and negotiations

The Amazon Labor Union didn't even exist until last year. Now the grassroots organization that relied on a crowdfunding campaign to fund its organizing is responsible for negotiating a collective bargaining agreement on behalf of roughly 6000 employees at Amazon's largest fulfillment center in New York. The ALU is led by Christian Smalls a former JFK8 manager who was fired by Amazon in 2020 after the company claimed he violated social distancing rules. Rather than getting to dictate pay benefits and working conditions as it does across its massive network of offices data centers and warehouses Amazon will now have to negotiate those key details with union leadership when it comes to JFK8. Contract talks between the ALU and Amazon could start soon. But don't bet on it. ""Amazon will delay"" said David Rosenfeld a labor lawyer at Weinberg Roger and Rosenfeld and a lecturer at the University California at Berkeley School of Law. ""They’re not going to walk in and do the right thing because that will encourage organizing everywhere else. They'll do everything they can to avoid a contract and it will be a big long nasty fight."" According to an analysis published in June by Bloomberg Law it takes on average 409 days for CBAs to be signed between employers and their newly unionized workers.

If the goal is delay Amazon has unlimited resources to hire the top lawyers and consultants. The company has already expressed its disappointment with the outcome and said it's considering its options including ""filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence"" of the National Labor Relations Board. Amazon didn't specify instances of improper meddling but said the National Retail Federation and Chamber of Commerce witnessed the same behavior. Either Amazon or the union can raise objections over conduct during the election. Both parties have left that door open. Any objection must be filed to the NLRB regional office by April 8. The agency will investigate the claims and if there's sufficient evidence will schedule a hearing where each side can present its case. Challenges don't have to end there. If they're unhappy with the regional director's ruling either side can escalate its complaint to the NLRB board in Washington.

Why wait?

Precedent is Amazon's principal concern. JFK8 is one of 100-plus Amazon fulfillment centers in the U.S. and there are many truckers and delivery drivers who aren't part of those facilities. Workers in Bessemer Alabama just wrapped up a second vote on whether to unionize and while the effort appears to have failed again the count was significantly closer than the first contest last year. Amazon has no interest in seeing the movement gain further momentum. And the company says there's no need for that to happen. Pay at fulfillment center starts at $18 an hour well above minimum wage in every U.S. state. Amazon also offers health insurance paid parental leave and educational opportunities. That sort of package has proved enticing to many workers particularly in parts of the country where older industries have died out and well-paying blue-collar jobs are scarce. But Amazon's warehouse model isn't built on retention. As The New York Times reported last year the company has adjusted to a pattern that involves extremely high employee churn. As it stands Amazon gets to control everything. If employees are unhappy they can walk out the door. Adding a union to the mix changes that dynamic completely because employees get bargaining power and a seat at the table. Amazon has the opportunity to embrace that reality said Anastasia Christman a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project in New York. ""They have this choice they can make"" Christman said. ""They can either decide to continue to fight this in a very negative way or say that workers have identified problems in the workforce and let's hear them out."" While the enforcement mechanisms facing Amazon may be limited public pressure is growing and the labor movement is gaining support. Starbucks baristas in several locations have voted to unionize and in late March Google Fiber contractors in Kansas City Missouri supported a union effort becoming the first workers with bargaining rights under the Alphabet Workers Union. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted his congratulations on Friday after the Amazon vote and said ""it's going to be a shot in the arm for this country's labor movement."" Amazon has thrived for almost three decades without the presence of unions in its U.S. operations. But in the last few years the company has drawn the ire of politicians and regulators for alleged anti-competitive behavior paying little in taxes and mistreating workers. This may be a time for the company to play nice and avoid a protracted battle said Tom Kochan a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. ""I would expect now that there is this first victory on the part of a union that Amazon is going to have to reassess its labor relations strategy and begin to negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement"" said Kochan an expert on work and employment policies. ""They will add fuel to the flames if they continue to stonewall in negotiations as they have so vigorously resisted in the organizing phase."" WATCH: Workers vote for union at Amazon NYC warehouse",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL25ld3MtYW5kLXBvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjIvMDQvYW1hem9uLXVuaW9uLXN0YXRlbi1pc2xhbmQtY2hyaXN0aWFuLXNtYWxscy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Amazon employees won their first union.,"It’s rare to call a unionization victory historic but it’s hard to avoid calling this week’s win at a giant 8000-employee Amazon warehouse in Staten Island anything but that.

Amazon is an American juggernaut a hugely powerful corporation that is the nation’s second largest private employer with nearly one million workers. It is also one of the fiercest anti-union companies in the United States. Not one of its facilities in the country has been unionized—until now.

Much like the first union victory at a corporate-owned Starbucks—which happened last December in Buffalo—the union win in Staten Island will inspire many workers and many more unionization drives at Amazon and elsewhere. Indeed the unionization effort in Staten Island must have gotten some momentum and lift from the union wave spreading across the U.S. not just at Starbucks but at REI and the Art Institute of Chicago and among New York Times tech workers and elsewhere.

The effort was led by Christian Smalls and Derrick Palmer both of whom worked at the Staten Island Amazon fulfillment center. Palmer still works there but Smalls was fired from the job in March 2020 after he led a protest outside the warehouse asserting that Amazon was not doing enough to protect workers from Covid including not having adequate social distancing. As its reason for firing Smalls Amazon said he violated social distancing rules.

Last year when Smalls first set his sights on unionization it looked like a quixotic venture.

He was creating a new union the Amazon Labor Union from scratch and was raising money for the campaign through GoFundMe. It seemed like a mark of desperation. Moreover Smalls was tilting his lance at a $470-billion-a-year giant which was employing an army of anti-union consultants some of whom were paid $3200 a day.

But it turns out that Smalls had many things going for him. The pandemic helped his union drive: Amazon’s business revenues and profits boomed during the pandemic and Jeff Bezos’ net worth soared by tens of billions of dollars. Amazon employees in Staten Island and elsewhere felt they were working harder and faster than ever but weren’t sharing adequately in Amazon’s increased profits. Many viewed unionization as a way to get a fairer deal and make their high-stress jobs less unpleasant.

It didn’t help that Bezos took a rocket ship into space in the summer of 2021 making Amazon workers think he had billions of dollars to waste—money they thought could have gone to higher wages. Celebrating the union’s victory on Friday Smalls said “We want to thank Jeff Bezos for going to space because while he was up there we were organizing a union.”

From the beginning Smalls deliberately took a different tack than traditional unions. He wanted to show that he and his team of organizers—current and former Amazon workers—knew Amazon through and through and that he and the other organizers knew what Amazon workers wanted.

Smalls boasted that his effort would succeed even though a union drive at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer Alabama failed last year because the Staten Island effort was led by current and former Amazon workers and included few outsider organizers. Many employees including Palmer vigorously talked up unionizing inside the break room and during lunch. They also distributed literature in the workplace and wore pro-union T-shirts. Palmer and others showed a fearlessness that encouraged their coworkers to speak up and show their pro-union colors publicly.

The Staten Island effort also found a handy location to reach out to workers: a bus stop just outside the warehouse. Many Staten Island Amazon workers take public buses to work so Smalls and the other organizers had easy access to them frequently talking to people as they were coming and going from shifts. That was far different from the Amazon Bessemer warehouse—and many other workplaces—where organizers can have a hard time getting a word with workers except by visiting their homes. Companies often prohibit organizers from setting foot on company property including parking lots.

Amazon employed a dour the-union-is-bad message while the union had a winning hopeful message. The union promised to seek longer rest breaks and minimum pay of $30 an hour up from the current $18 minimum. In contrast Amazon repeatedly warned workers that their wages and benefits could decrease if they voted to unionize. But with the nation’s jobless rate low and wages rising across the country Amazon’s warnings looked dark and disingenuous.

In February Amazon unwittingly helped turned Smalls into a hero and martyr when it had the police arrest him as he was delivering lunch to some workers at the Staten Island warehouse. By then the union drive was in many ways a popularity contest and the union had already won.

Smalls and his fellow organizers were cool and likable fighting the Amazon beast raging against the Bezos machine. They made the union fun posting pro-union TikTok messages having picnics and parties and delivering free pizzas to the warehouse’s breakroom. Meanwhile many workers saw Amazon despite its comparatively good benefits as a harsh taskmaster that made employees do very repetitive jobs rapidly day after day with constant monitoring and computer apps often warning about small infractions.

When push came to shove the workers saw an attractive way to seek change: unionizing. According to results the National Labor Relations Board released on Friday Amazon’s Staten Island employees cast 2654 votes to be represented by the Amazon Labor Union and 2131 against giving the union a win by more than 10 percentage points.

This historical union victory bucked several tides. Unions rarely win organizing drives at large factories stores or warehouses against aggressively anti-union companies like Amazon Walmart or Target. And in a nation where the percentage of workers in unions has declined from one in three in the 1950s to one in five in the 1980s to one in ten now the tide has been ebbing for organized labor.

But now we are perhaps seeing a shift. The historic union win in Staten Island and the string of highly publicized union wins at Starbucks—plus a revote at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer that is too close to call (challenged ballots still to be counted could deliver victory to either side)—are all examples of courage and determination that are giving many unionization efforts energy and publicity. Some labor experts talk of a possible new pro-labor surge.

Young Americans are helping power these efforts. A recent Gallup poll found that 77 percent of young Americans (between ages 18 and 34) approve of unions. Undergraduate student workers are unionizing at Dartmouth Wesleyan and Grinnell. So are thousands of grad students and adjunct professors. Thousands of twenty-somethings and thirty-somethings in newsrooms museums and non-profit organizations are also unionizing. It certainly doesn’t hurt that Joe Biden is a pro-union president helping improve the atmosphere for organizing.

What happened in Staten Island this week shows that change is in the air. The big question now is: Can America’s unions and its workers overall somehow seize on the moment and turn this into a bigger wave?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA0LzAyL2FtYXpvbi1sYWJvci11bmlvbi1zdHJhdGVneS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Worker-led win at Amazon warehouse could provide new labor playbook,"The unorthodox but stunningly successful unionization campaign by Amazon employees in New York was propelled by a burst of new energy by many worker groups which have emerged from the coronavirus pandemic with new tactics and edge.

But if you're hoping to skip the crowds it might be in your best interest to opt for a fall trip to Europe.

Not only are hotels cheaper and attractions less crowded but you might also be able to take advantage of a special sweet spot award: American Airlines' 45000-mile off-peak economy award.

If you travel to Europe between Nov. 1 – Dec. 14 this year you'll save 25% on the usual redemption rate. With American's sizeable route network between the U.S. and Europe you'll also have many options that don't involve hefty taxes and fuel surcharges.

Here's everything you need to know about American AAdvantage off-peak award tickets to Europe:

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

Why it's special

An economy class award ticket to Europe normally costs around 60000 miles round-trip. Redeeming just 45000 AAdvantage miles is a significant discount. Thanks to American not adding fuel surcharges to its own flights it's possible to book these awards with minimal taxes and fees. You'll pay just $5.60 out of pocket on a one-way flight that departs from the U.S. to Europe.

This award is even more attainable due to how easily you can earn AAdvantage miles. In fact you can book this award with just a single credit card sign-up bonus. More on that later.

How to book this award

The great thing about this American Airlines sweet spot award to Europe is that you can book it online in minutes. Award availability is also great in the fall when travel demand tends to be lower. Here's how to book this award step-by-step:

Step 1: Log into your account

While you can search award space without logging in doing so saves you an extra step when you're ready to book. You can log in by heading to aa.com and selecting ""login"" on the upper right corner of the homepage.

Step 2: Enter your trip information

Step 3: Confirm your travel dates

You can look through all the available flight options on the search results page and change your date if you can't find saver award space.

You can choose the ""calendar"" function for a more extensive search and find availability across several months.

When selecting a flight keep an eye out for any abnormally high taxes. These tend to appear on flights with British Airways segments transiting through London.

Step 4: Confirm and pay

Once you've found your flights you can proceed with redeeming your award. If you're logged in most of the fields will be pre-filled and you'll need to remember to enter your Global Entry PASSID and pay for your flight. Ideally you'd use a credit card that offers bonus miles on airline spending to pay the taxes and fees.

(Screenshot courtesy of aa.com)

You can transfer points from Bilt Rewards to American at a 1:1 transfer ratio if you're short on American miles. Alternatively you can transfer Marriott Bonvoy points to American at a 3:1 transfer ratio with a 5000 mile bonus added to every 60000 points transferred. This means that 60000 Marriott points equal 25000 airline miles.

Or if you're really in a pinch you can buy miles. That can work out favorably if you're buying them during a sale but it can take several days for your miles to post.

The good news is that American Airlines does allow you to put award tickets on hold for up to seven days. That should be enough time to process any mileage purchases.

It's A Little More Complicated.,"To much fanfare American AAdvantage announced that its elite members would have access to JetBlue extra legroom ‘Even More’ seats if available at check-in.

I inquired whether this benefit was available during online check-in not just for JetBlue operated and marketed flights but whether it would also work when booking an American Airlines codeshare for travel on JetBlue. A spokesperson told me it would “customers will need to use the JetBlue online check in path or go to an agent to request these seats.”

Except right as the announcement was being made American Airlines reservations agents were being told the opposite. When booking an American Airlines codeshare traveling on JetBlue AAdvantage elites cannot select extra legroom seats during online check-in and they cannot even select extra seats at airport kiosks  either.

In fact AAdvantage elites can only request extra legroom seats in-person with an agent at the airport on these tickets. Here’s the meat of the March 23rd memo to American Airlines reservations agents:

This much-touted benefit isn’t quite ready for prime time despite the hoopla surrounding it. Extra legroom seats free at the airport is something but there may be less inventory available when you show up for your flight than there would have been checking in online 24 hours prior to your flight.

Once again booking a codeshare is rarely a good idea unless the price if low enough to make up for the hassle and inferior experience. That’s hardly limited to the American-JetBlue relationship.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFqb3ItdXMtYWlybGluZXMtZGVsYXllZC1jYW5jZWxlZC1tb3JlLXRoYW4tMTAwMDAtZmxpZ2h0cy13ZWVrZW5kLTIwMjItNNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFqb3ItdXMtYWlybGluZXMtZGVsYXllZC1jYW5jZWxlZC1tb3JlLXRoYW4tMTAwMDAtZmxpZ2h0cy13ZWVrZW5kLTIwMjItND9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US airlines delayed or canceled more than 10000 flights this weekend,

The notion didn’t carry much credibility in the boating world since water’s high drag caused batteries to deplete quickly and severely limited range. And who wants to be stuck offshore with dead batteries?

Technology may have finally caught up to the concept with more than two dozen builders (and counting) having recently launched new EV runabouts. Range remains the restricting factor but these inshore craft now make sense to four-wheeled EV owners who understand the charging routine. In return: no emissions instant acceleration and silent running likely acceptable tradeoffs for boaters who typically use their vessels for only limited periods anyway.

He held a number of positions at Central and Southwest Corporation subsidiaries (now known as American Electric Power) including the Executive of the British Utility Seeboard and went on to retire as President of SWEPCO in 2003. Upon his retirement Mike was hired as Chief Operating Officer of CLECO Corporation in Pineville LA. After two years he was promoted to President and Chief Executive Officer. Mike was instrumental in the development and design of a powerplant that now holds his name Madison Unit 3. It is because of his vision and dedication that the highest honor in the electrical industry the Edison Award was awarded to CLECO in June of 2011. In 2012 Mike retired from CLECO and went on to serve with the Board of Directors for Blackhill Corporation in Rapid City SD until 2021.

Mike held many other positions and titles during his career including President of the Committee of 100 an organization of leading business executives helping to develop Louisiana's economy.

Mike Madison as we all know was a very successful man with a distinguished career but if you were to ask him what his biggest accomplishment was… he would say his family. There was nothing more important to Mike than his wife his two daughters and his four grandchildren.

Honoring Mike as pallbearers will be his sons-in-law Urban Farmer and Christopher Lutz and grandchildren Briar Stott Madison Stott Hunter Farmer and Colton Lutz.

In a Feb. 3 news conference Gov. Greg Abbott listed the reasons why he believed Texans should have confidence in the grid: ""As compared to last year Texas has about 15% more power generation capacity.""

Seasonal data from grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas indicates available generation capacity is at 85000 megawatts for winter 2021-2022 up from 83000 megawatts in winter 2020-2021.

That comes out to be a 2% increase. So where did Abbott get 15%?

More:'She was my everything': A chaotic week of preventable deaths in Austin as Texas froze

Abbott referred to installed capacity

Abbott's office referred PolitiFact Texas to the Texas Public Utility Commission which oversees ERCOT.

According to ERCOT and PUC officials the 15% cited by Abbott describes an increase in total installed capacity from 102874 megawatts in winter 2020 to 118257 megawatts in winter 2021.

Total installed capacity refers to the maximum amount of power that can be generated under ideal conditions.

""That's just if everything we had on the grid was operating at its full output. That's what it could make"" said Joshua Rhodes research associate at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute and Webber Energy Group.

However at any given time the grid isn't producing at 100% potential experts told PolitiFact Texas. For example the sun isn't always shining for solar energy or the wind isn't always blowing for wind energy Doug Lewin energy consultant and president of Stoic Energy Consulting said as example.

""It's sort of more of a theoretical potential"" Lewin said.

""There is no resource that has a 100% operational capacity"" Lewin said. ""That does not exist but generally thermal plants have a higher operational capacity. But when you start to put together enough wind and solar and they're spread out across a broad enough geographic area their overall capacity factors or operational capacity increases.""

Rhodes also said a lot of the capacity added in the last year included wind and solar which would not operate at 100% capacity all the time.

""We don't expect all the wind and all the solar to be available during a winter peak event"" Rhodes said.

ERCOT officials said in February that the grid has a total generating capacity at about 86000 megawatts if needed the American-Statesman reported then.

More:We're tracking power outages in Austin and Central Texas plus ERCOT grid updates

The value Abbott cited described what the grid is capable of creating though the amount of available power might be less than total installed capacity.

""I don't think there's anything wrong with saying we added a whole lot of capacity in the last year"" Lewin said.

Aidan Tuohy program manager of Grid Operations and Planning at the research and development firm Electric Power Research Institute said resource adequacy assessments have processes to account for wind patterns and sunlight in its seasonal estimates.

""One that let's say ERCOT used they look at historical performance and then take either an average during stressful conditions or some other statistical measure during stressful conditions"" Tuohy said. ""And then another way to do that is to actually simulate operations. For example in California they simulate a thousand different patterns of generator outages and wind and solar patterns based on historical data and then try to come up with what the expected observed load will be.""

ERCOT included risk assessments for thermal resources based on historical information Tuohy also noted.

More:Abbott touts grid's performance during freeze. But was last week's storm a true test?

Our ruling

As Texas braced for the effects of cold weather Abbott assured Texans: ""Compared to last year Texas has about 15% more power generation capacity.""

Experts say Abbott was referring to the total installed capacity if power generation infrastructure were running at 100% capacity. However that is a theoretical figure. Instead stations generate at a fraction of the total installed capacity. The amount of available power in an emergency situation would be less than the installed capacity.

We rate this as Mostly True.

The renewable electricity will be supplied from the Pampa Energía and Parque de la Bahía wind farms and the agreement considers a future expansion of Parque de la Bahia which will start to generate wind power in March 2023.

Increasing the use of wind solar and other sources of renewable electricity is one of the ways Bunge is striving for its science-based targets which call for an absolute reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. This agreement in Argentina follows similar recent partnerships between Bunge and renewable electricity providers in North America and Europe which underscore the company’s commitment to climate action.

“We are focused on creating clear and measurable pathways to achieve our sustainability goals toward climate action in our operations and across our value chains” said Ramón Fernández Asenjo vice president industrial operations for Bunge. “This agreement reinforces our strategy in providing sustainable low-carbon solutions in food and ingredient production to consumers around the world.”

Bunge is among the top agricultural exporters in Argentina having shipped 12.7 million tonnes of grains and grain byproducts from the South American nation in 2021 according to the Rosario Stock Exchange.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWFtZXJpY2FuLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDQvMDIvc2h1dC1vZmYtbW9yYXRvcml1bS1saWZ0ZWQtcGVuZWxlYy1jYW4taGVscC13aXRoLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1pc3N1ZXMvNjUzNDc3NTIwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shut-off moratorium lifted: Penelec can help with financial issues,"For individuals and families strapped for money to pay utility bills there is help out there.

On Friday the Pennsylvania winter utility disconnection moratoriums were lifted and shut-offs for nonpayment resumed.

""There are a variety of resources available to assist at-risk consumers and the first/best step consumers can take to explore these options is to reach out directly to their public utility"" according to Nils Hagen-Frederiksen press secretary office of communications Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.

""Customers who are in danger of termination know who they are. It is a long process to disconnect that includes 10-days written notice mailed out and subsequent phone calls and visits before someone ever comes out to turn off the power"" said Todd Meyers senior communications representative FirstEnergy Corp. Penelec merged with FirstEnergy in 2001.

According to Hagen-Frederiksen each major utility has a team of representatives trained to help consumers explore the many options that may be available and connect those families with the necessary resources. The utilities can explain about the assistance programs available in their communities for income-qualified consumers operated by utilities and non-profit organizations.

""The last thing we want to do is apply a late fee or issue a disconnection notice to a customer facing financial hardship when it can be avoided by simply giving our customer service team a call and explain their situation and see what help is available to them"" Meyers said.

Why:Energy costs rose 33% last year. Here's what to do to lower those bills in 2022.

Customers experiencing financial hardship are urged to contact their electric utility as soon as possible to establish affordable payment arrangements or obtain assistance he said.

""We find many customers are unaware of the help that is out there for them or may be embarrassed or afraid to reach out for assistance with past-due balances on their electric bill"" Meyers said.

In responses Penelec developed a campaign entitled “We’re Customers Just Like You” where personal experiences of the utility's employees are highlighted in a video he said. Additionally there is a bill assistance web page at www.firstenergycorp.com/billassist displays available programs based on income and household size Meyers said.

The most recent publicly available figure in a 2020 report from the Pennsylvania Public Utility placed the number of customers behind on their electric bills at around 56000 or 11% of Penelec's customer base.

And the payment services giant advises that some users may continue to experience issues online or over the phone.

The issues reported by users included being unable to log in to their Amex accounts make payments or get to an Amex customer service representative over the phone.

BleepingComputer was able to briefly reproduce issues right before Amex confirmed partially restoring services.

Broken two-factor authentication

American Express customers around the world were left without the means to make payments as hours-long outages prevented users from logging into their accounts.

The online systems of the payment card services provider went down on Friday April 1st and kept malfunctioning for hours as also observed by BleepingComputer.

Amex put up a banner on its homepage that it was ""aware that technical difficulties"" were affecting phone lines online account services and the Amex mobile app.

Amex announced on its homepage it was experiencing issues (BleepingComputer)

In multiple tests by BleepingComputer we observed the log-in screen prompted for a ""one-time verification code"" multiple times; upon every successful log-in attempt—even though we were signing-in from the same device previously used to access the account. The mobile app also exhibited this behavior:

Amex repeatedly prompted for MFA code even when logging from the same device

(BleepingComputer)

As services started coming back up BleepingComputer was able to get past the two-factor code screen after successful authentication only to land on a ""not found"" page where the Dashboard should be.

Amex redirected users to 'not found' page instead of Dashboard (BleepingComputer)

Technologist Jacob Rothstein suspected whether the issues were connected to Amex's recently introduced ""one login for all accounts"" feature. The new feature integration would enable customers to access both Savings accounts and credit cards from one dashboard Amex had previously announced.

But that still fails to explain the telephone service disruptions.

Cyber threat intel analyst Anis Haboubi surmised if the recent hacks on Okta Sitel and Globant by Lapsus$ could've played a role—both Sitel and Globant list Amex among their clients.

However BleepingComputer hasn't seen hard evidence just yet establishing a link between these incidents.

'Add a Debit Card' took you to ATM locator map

The claims of users facing difficulties making payments towards their Amex account balances were also reproduced by BleepingComputer.

When navigating to the 'Make a payment' page payment history did not load. Clicking on 'Add a Debit Card' button redirected us to a map of nearby ATMs.

As of this morning the Amex online account services do allow payments via bank account a newly introduced feature especially for UK customers in addition to accepting debit card payments.

This indicates the payments giant quite likely broke something while rolling out the new functionality as far as the online services outage is concerned.

'Don't do business without it.®'

On April 1st after multiple reports of problems faced by customers American Express did confirm that the online account services were back up on both web and mobile:

Amex resolved these issues after hours (Twitter)

However in its latest tweet American Express has backtracked and explains some customers may still face issues:

""We're experiencing a systems issue resulting in some Card Members being unable to access products & services on web & mobile app. Most systems have been restored but some customers may experience longer-than-usual hold times. We apologize to our customers for any inconvenience.""

The reason behind these multi-hour disruptions is yet to be known. The impact to Amex phone lines in addition to the web and mobile app outages makes this case especially interesting.

It isn't unusual for call centers and websites of companies to go down at the same time following a cyberattack. However a person familiar with the matter tells BleepingComputer that the Amex disruption is not related to a cyberattack.

Update April 5th 01:05 AM ET: Added that a source familiar with the matter says the Amex outage is not from a cyberattack.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FtZXgtb2ZmZXJpbmctNDAtYm9udXMtb24tdHJhbnNmZXJzLXRvLWJyaXRpc2gtYWlyd2F5cy1hZXItbGluZ3VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amex offering 40% bonus on transfers to British Airways Aer Lingus,"American Express currently has a few transfer bonus opportunities that could help cardholders maximize their points this spring. Amex is offering 40% bonuses to members who transfer Membership Rewards point to British Airways Executive Club and Aer Lingus AerClub Avios.

Amex is also offering 25% bonuses to members who transfer their Membership Rewards to the Marriott Bonvoy program. All of these offers expire next month.

Get the latest points miles and travel news by signing up for TPG's free daily newsletter.

This is a chance for travelers to get great value converting their points to Avios which transfer easily to British Airways and Aer Lingus accounts. It could also help travelers reach their points goals with Marriott for a hotel stay in coming months. Check your American Express account to see if you're eligible for these deals.

Eligibility

In order to be eligible for these types of offers in the future you need to earn Membership Rewards points with an American Express card. Here's our guide to picking the right one for your spending habits.

Transfers to Avios

The Amex offers for both British Airways Executive Club and Aer Lingus Aer Club involve 40% bonuses when you convert Membership Rewards to Avios. That means the transfer is happening at a 1:1.4 ratio so if you transfer 1000 Amex points you'd get 1400 Avios. This offer is valid through May 15 and is capped at transfers resulting in 999000 Avios.

This particular transfer bonus is an intriguing opportunity for Amex cardholders not just because of the size of the bonus but the flexibility you'll have by converting your points into Avios.

For one British Airways operates a multitude of flights between the U.S. and London. If you're looking to get to Europe this summer the carrier has flights to London from major U.S. airports which could get you directly to the United Kingdom or connect you to another destination in Europe Africa or Asia.

On top of that your Avios can also be used on flights operated by British Airways' Oneworld Alliance partners like Alaska American Iberia and Qatar among others.

Aer Lingus also uses Avios as its reward currency which gives members the chance to use their bonus miles on several other international airlines including Avianca and Vueling.

Spending Avios

Even if you live in a U.S. city that does not have an airport served by British Airways or Aer Lingus you can still make use of this Amex bonus transfer opportunity.

For instance I'm based in the Raleigh/Durham area and British Airways does not fly to RDU. But I can still book a direct award flight from RDU to London Heathrow Airport (LHR) this June because Oneworld partner American Airlines is resuming direct service to Heathrow.

Randomly picking a seven-day round trip in June I found nonstop service to Heathrow and back for 41500 Avios on flights operated by American. If I had 30000 Amex Membership Rewards points in my account I'd get a 12000 Avios bonus if I transferred those Amex points into a British Airways Executive Club account giving me 42000 Avios – just enough to cover the cost of this round trip with the exception of a fairly significant $650.47 in carrier charges.

Transfers to Marriott Bonvoy

The 25% bonus transfer opportunity from Amex Membership Rewards to Marriott Bonvoy points could also be a great opportunity if you're looking to cover the cost of a hotel stay you're planning in the near future. This offer ends May 31.

Keep in mind Marriott recently implemented dynamic pricing to its rewards program so that could impact the deals you're able to find. That being said let's take a look at some options for that June week I was looking at in London.

A six-night stay at the Moxy London Stratford a Marriott property comes to approximately $1428 depending on conversion rates. The same stay goes for 131000 Marriott Bonvoy points including one free night when you book with points. So if you had 105000 Amex Membership Rewards points transferring those into your Marriott Bonvoy account would get you a 25% bonus or 26250 extra points bringing your total to 131250 – just enough to cover your stay.

Bottom line

If you're starting to make travel plans for the summer this bonus transfer offer could help boost your points or miles stash. Be sure to check your Amex account to see what offers you've received and consider how moving your points to each of these rewards programs might help you maximize your rewards.

Adding an authorized user to your credit card account can be a great way to meet spending requirements accrue more points and even help a novice build their credit history. While it can be highly beneficial there are also risks associated with adding an authorized user — or even being one yourself.

It's important to choose someone who is responsible and able to repay their debts even if they're not legally obligated to do so. That's just the tip of the iceberg so here is everything you need to know about authorized users.

What is an authorized user?

An authorized user is a person who has been added to a primary credit cardholder's account. Authorized users receive cards with their names on them linked to the primary cardholder's account. They're able to use those cards to make purchases just like they would with their own cards.

Benefits of adding authorized users

Adding authorized users can be beneficial to both the primary cardholder and the authorized user for a few reasons:

The authorized user can help meet spending requirements on the primary cardholder's account.

The authorized user can establish a credit history early on.

But perhaps the best reason to add authorized users is the ability to take advantage of various card benefits for authorized users.

For example you can add up to 10 authorized users for free on the Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard® granting each of them (plus two guests or immediate family members) access to Admirals Club lounges when flying American or its partners.

Meanwhile you can add up to four authorized users for free on the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card extending access to Capital One and Priority Pass lounges for your authorized user and up to two guests.

Additionally having authorized users on your Ultimate Rewards credit card allows you to transfer rewards directly to their loyalty program accounts. This is really great if you have a stash of Ultimate Rewards points you want to transfer to a family member's MileagePlus account. Sharing United miles carries a fee of $7.50 per 500 miles plus a $30 processing fee. But you can transfer Ultimate Rewards points directly into the United MileagePlus account of an authorized user without violating any rules or incurring hefty fees.

While Chase allows household members to transfer Ultimate Rewards points to each other in order to transfer Ultimate Rewards directly into another loyalty account (e.g. United Southwest Hyatt) the other account must be held by an authorized user on your Chase credit card.

The downside of adding authorized users

The downside of adding authorized users is that it may become more difficult to track spending when two people are using the same card. Also the primary cardholder is responsible for all charges to the account. So if your authorized user goes on a spending spree and refuses to cover the charges you'll be on the hook for their purchases.

Making someone an authorized user carries risk. Only add an authorized user you completely trust and be sure to communicate ahead of time about your expectations for repayment.

Who can be an authorized user?

Barring issuer-specific age restrictions anyone can be an authorized user. American Express requires authorized users to be at least 13 years old and have no defaulted accounts with the bank. Discover imposes a minimum age of 15 and U.S. Bank requires authorized users to be at least 16 years old.

Bank of America Capital One Chase Citi and Wells Fargo do not impose age restrictions.

Can I remove an authorized user?

Removing an authorized user is as simple as calling your credit card issuer. Some banks including Citi even let you do it online. Once the user has been removed from the account which is typically done in a matter of minutes the credit card becomes inactive.

However it may take several weeks for the card to no longer be listed as an active account on your authorized user's credit report.

Get the most benefit for adding an authorized user

Some credit cards will provide incentives for adding authorized users to your account. For example the Virgin Atlantic World Elite Mastercard® currently offers 30000 Flying Club bonus miles after spending $1000 or more in purchases within the first 90 days of account opening.

Additionally you can earn up to 15000 Flying Club bonus miles every anniversary after qualifying purchases and up to 5000 Flying Club bonus miles when you add additional cardholders to your account.

The information for the Virgin Atlantic card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Furthermore if you have a credit card that offers a big spending incentive adding an authorized user is a great way to help you meet that requirement. For example spending on your Southwest credit cards counts toward the coveted Companion Pass. Earning 125000 points per year is a little easier when you have a big-spending (and responsible) authorized user to help you get there.

Another way to benefit from having an authorized user on your card is with the The Platinum Card® from American Express. The card carries a flat $195 fee to add each authorized user (see rates and fees). However this includes key benefits like lounge access complimentary Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors Gold elite status and more.

Note that you can add up to five authorized users to the American Express® Gold Card for free (see rates and fees). These authorized users can then earn Membership Rewards points at the same rate as the primary cardholder: 4 points per dollar at restaurants and 4 points per dollar at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25000 in purchases per calendar year then 1 point per dollar).

This is a great way for household members to get many of the best benefits of two rewarding cards.

How do authorized users affect my credit — and their own?

Adding an authorized user will not impact your credit unless the additional card racks up a large amount of spending and increases your credit utilization ratio. This can be avoided by paying off large balances before the statement closing date.

Meanwhile authorized users can see a positive credit impact by having access to an additional credit line and lowering their own credit utilization ratios. For those building a credit history being an authorized user can be a huge boost.

When I was in high school my sister added me as an authorized user on her Bank of America credit card. By the time my 18th birthday rolled around I had a two-year credit history and got approved for the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express. It worked out well for me and because I didn't use the card for crazy spending sprees my sister's credit wasn't negatively impacted.

It takes responsible people on both sides to mitigate possible negative impacts of adding an authorized user.

Should you open a joint account or add an authorized user?

The difference between a joint account and an authorized user comes down to liability. Joint account holders share liability for charges while authorized users do not. Primary cardholders can also limit the amount of credit an authorized user can utilize. Joint account holders together can access the full credit line.

Being a joint account holder may prevent you from qualifying for your own version of the same card in the future. For example my mom was added as a joint account holder to my dad's Chase Sapphire Preferred Card years ago. When she applied for her own card last year she was denied because Chase viewed her as already having the card. If she had been an authorized user (as opposed to a joint account holder) she would have qualified for her own card.

There isn't much of an upside to joint accounts other than lessening the burden of liability on the primary cardholder. Ideally you shouldn't be adding anyone to your credit card (as an authorized user or joint account holder) unless you trust them to use it responsibly.

Bottom line

Adding an authorized user can be widely beneficial to both parties. However it's important to be aware of the risks as the last thing you want to do is sour a relationship because of one person's financial irresponsibility. Only add an authorized user whom you completely trust to be responsible with your credit line and pay their share of the balance on time.

PHOENIX Ariz. – It was a beautiful morning at the Arizona Cup the largest United States Archery Qualifier Series event in history as senior and 50+ archers took the field for qualification.

In a tough compound men’s field 17-year-old Sawyer Sullivan made his senior USAT debut coming up just two points off his U18 world record with a stout 712 in the wind to outscore the Netherlands’ Mike Schloesser’s 711 and take the top seed. James Lutz was third with 708 while 13 men broke 700 in a tight race. “I started out pretty nervous today but I found my rhythm” shared Sullivan who said his legs were shaking and the wind tripped him up a few times. While Sullivan will also make his world cup debut later this season he said his primary goal right now is just to hang in there with the tough competition in the senior field. “I had a lot of fun shooting with my bale today we had a really great group and a great time” added Sullivan.

Tough international competition led the compound women; Great Britain’s Ella Gibson took the pole with a 711 also just shy of a world record. Toja Ellison Denmark’s Tanja Gellenthien and Paige Pearce also broke the 700-mark qualifying second through fourth with 703 701 and 700 respectively.

World Para Champion Matt Stutzman continues his hot streak this season topping the para compound men open qualification with a 698; Andre Shebly and Benjamin Thompson finished second and third with 688 and 679 respectively.

Wendy Gardner Martha Chavez and Chalyn Weaver led the para compound women open with Gardner’s 644 taking the top spot.

W1 World Para Champion Lia Coryell topped a full podium with a 579 – an exciting feat as the division is growing quickly in the U.S. Jonathan Charlesworth qualified second and Lucas Herro was third in his USAT debut after just receiving his para classification.

On his first USAT event and podium finish Herro commented: “I wish I would have performed a little bit better I had some equipment issues on the line but all in all I think I did a pretty good job.” Herro will be back for more this season and said his focus is to send as many quality arrows down as he can and keep improving to take this as far as he can take it.

Young faces topped the recurve women’s ranking round; 18-year-old Casey Kaufhold’s 674 gave her the top seed. 16-year-olds Gabrielle Sasai and Emma Kim were second and third with 657 and 646; this marks Kim’s senior USAT debut after a standout season in the U18 division last year.

“Today was good” shared Kaufhold. “I’ve mostly been shooting indoors so I didn’t really know what kind of score I would put down today. I came in without expectation and it wasn’t too windy so I focused on making good shots and it went really well. I’m really happy with how I shot today.”

Brady Ellison pulled off a 350 first half today and finished with a 687 to top the recurve men’s charts ahead of Matt Requa’s 673 and Trenton Cowles’ 669. Eric Bennett Paralympic Champion Kevin Mather and Michael Lukow went one-two-three for the para recurve men open with Bennett’s 616 winning out.

Brazil’s Fabiola Dergovics scored a 570 for the recurve women open’s top position 80 points clear the rest of the field. Candice Caesar and Emma Rose Ravish were second and third.

Christopher Garcia led the barebow senior men with a 634. Marcus Cooley and Richard Stonebraker qualified second and third with a 611 and 608. Christina Lyons Melody Richards and Kay Earls led the barebow women; Lyon’s pulled ahead by nearly 70 points finishing with a 601.

Tim Gillingham had a commanding lead for the compound 50+ men qualifying first with a 696. Andre Shelby and Larry Butterfield scored 688 and 682 to qualify in the next two spots. Deanna Cronin who like Gillingham dominated the entirety of last year’s USAT series crushed a 683 today to lead the women’s division by almost 30 points over Alanna Dunaway and Tamara Fontenot.

The recurve 50+ competition was heated and Ron Gosnell nabbed the top spot with a 642 just ahead of Matthew Bamberg’s 639. Tom Stevenson posted a 628 to qualify third. Nicole Rasor’s 612 locked up the top women’s spot ahead of Susan Bock’s 607 and Janis Grellner’s 590.

David Nesbitt and Ben Rogers were close for the barebow 50+ men with Nesbitt qualifying first with a 579 while Thomas Aaron was third. Sabrina Harrigan’s 553 was the standout score for the barebow 50+ women over Barbara Carroll and Joy Burkhardt.

Competition continues this afternoon with youth elimination matches. The senior and 50+ archers return tomorrow for head to head matches.

There has been a proliferation of writing about who will shape the future world order since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 the most murderous Europe has suffered since 1939.

The provocative title of the panel that lead off the ambitiously named World Government Summit here last week was framed to suggest that a new global order is emerging — and the world is not ready for it.

That sounds like good news but there is a downside.

""The Russian invasion of Ukraine and a series of COVID-related shutdowns in China do not on the surface appear to have much in common"" writes Atlantic Council fellow Michael Schuman in The Atlantic (a publication not related to the Council). ""Yet both are accelerating a shift that is taking the world in a dangerous direction splitting it into two spheres one centered on Washington D.C. the other on Beijing.""

My conversations in Dubai — at the World Government Summit and at the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Forum — show little enthusiasm or conviction for this bifurcated vision of the future. The Middle Eastern participants have no interest in abandoning relations with China the leading trading partner for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates or breaking with Russia which established itself as a force to be reckoned with when it saved Syrian President Bashar al-Assad through its military intervention in his war.

Beyond that our Mideast partners have lost confidence in America's commitment to global leadership or competence for it following last year's botched Afghanistan withdrawal. They are also experiencing whiplash from a Trump administration that trashed the nuclear deal with Iran to a Biden administration they feel is pursuing it without sufficiently factoring in Tehran's regional aggression.

In all my many travels to the Mideast over the years I have never heard this level of frustration from Mideast government officials with American policymakers.

That said they are watching Ukraine with fascination because a Ukrainian victory — with a strong united West behind it — would force a rethink about U.S. commitment and competence and shift the trajectory of declining transatlantic influence and relevance. Conversely a Putin victory — even at a huge cost to Russians and Ukrainians alike — would accelerate Western decline as an effective global actor.

My own answer to the panel question on our preparedness for ""the new world order"" was to quote Henry Kissinger (who else?) in questioning the premise. ""No truly 'global' world order' has ever existed"" Kissinger wrote in his book ""World Order."" ""What passes for order in our time was devised in Western Europe nearly four centuries ago at a peace conference in the German region of Westphalia conducted without the involvement or even the awareness of most other continents or civilizations."" Over the following centuries its influence spread.

With that as context the question is not what the new world order would be but rather if the U.S. and its allies can through Ukraine reverse the erosion of the past century's gains as a first step toward establishing the first truly ""global"" world order.

Former U.S. National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley tells me the effort was the fourth attempt toward international order in the past century.

The first effort after World War I through the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations tragically failed. Instead the world got European fascism U.S. isolationism a global economic crisis and millions dead from the Holocaust and World War II.

Following World War II the U.S. and its partners were dramatically more successful building what came to be called ""the liberal international order"" through the Marshall Plan and new multilateral institutions like the United Nations the World Bank and IMF NATO the European Union and others.

The third effort came following the West's Cold War triumph. European democracies emerged or were restored NATO was enlarged the European Union expanded and it seemed for a time that the rules practices and institutions developed in the West after World War II and during the Cold War period could absorb and steer an expanded international order. China profited from and embraced this order for a time.

What has been eroding now for some years is U.S. leaders' commitment to defend uphold and advance that expanded international order — what Kissinger called ""an inexorably expanding cooperative order of states observing common rules and norms embracing liberal economic systems forswearing territorial conquest respecting national sovereignty and adopting participatory and democratic systems of government.""

American foreign policy leadership has rarely been consistent but it was remarkably so after World War II and through the end of the Cold War. Since then the inconsistencies have grown underscored by former President Barack Obama's ""leading from behind"" and former President Donald Trump's ""America First.""

Both in their own ways were a retreat from former President Harry Truman and the post-World War II architecture and U.S. global leadership he established and embraced.

In the Middle East countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE that were once our closest allies now are hedging their bets. Beyond the Iran disagreements the failure of former President Trump to accept his own electoral defeat raises doubts among our friends about the durability of the American political system and the consistency of U.S. foreign policy.

Beyond that our Mideast friends resent the Biden administration's characterization of the emerging global contest as one pitting democracy versus authoritarianism.

""Every democratic attempt in the Arab world has turned ideological or tribal so I'm not sure it is something we can work out successfully"" Anwar Gargash diplomatic adviser to the UAE President told the World Government Summit. He sees the issues between democracy and authoritarianism as not binary but ones of governance and the solution being ""something in the middle of both.""

President Joe Biden's decision to release on Thursday an ""unprecedented"" 180 million barrels of crude from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve was an acknowledgment that America's traditional oil-producing partners were not prepared to help him. The decision came hours after OPEC ignored calls from western politicians to pump oil more quickly – and to resist any suggestion they should remove Russia from the organization.

Meanwhile Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visited New Delhi this week to thank India for its refusal to join sanctions against Russia an approach shared by Brazil Mexico Israel and the UAE. Said Lavrov ""We will be ready to supply to India any goods which India wants to buy.""

To shape the future world order the U.S. and Europe first need to reverse the trajectory of Western and democratic decline in Ukraine.

The rest will need to follow.

It would be the writer’s last truth-seeking adventure before he found fame with On the Road and began his demise into alcoholism and mental instability. He had been assigned to record aircraft sightings but used the Air Force forms to roll his cigarettes.“

Stark naked rock pinnacles and thousand feet high protruding from immense timbered shoulders … awful vaulty blue smokebody rock” described Kerouac of the lookout which appeared in several of his later books Lonesome Traveler The Dharma Bums and Desolation Angels.

Today America’s fire lookouts are mostly retired. Before new technologies began rendering them obsolete in the 70s there were as many as 8000 lookout towers across the nation at their peak. Most were abandoned due to shrinking budgets some burned down others were dismantled. Only around 10% of America’s original fire towers still survive today but if you’re itching for a Kerouac truth-seeking adventure this summer you might be interested to know that you can actually stay overnight in one of the surviving towers…

If you aren’t afraid of heights there are dozens of lookouts across the US that have been restored for recreational purposes available for as little as $20 a night. It’s secret tourism at its finest…

“If you don’t mind packing in your own gear and staying on top of the world try renting a lookout!” writes the Forest Fire Lookout Association which lists maintains a list of available towers across the country. Many of the towers date back to the 1920s a good many of them located in Oregon Montana Idaho and California.

Must love heights! Guests who choose to stay the night should probably be aware that access to these towers is not always a walk in the park. The Pickett Butte Tower in Oregon for example can only be reach by climbing 40 feet up a narrow stairway. Five Mile Butte also in Oregon can only be accessed by skiing snowmobiling or snowshoeing and the trek takes about three to four hours. The views however more than make up for the journey.

Still used in active fire detection today the lookout was placed on the rocky cliff via helicopter in the 1960’s. Before the advent of airplane surveillance for fire detection there were more than a dozen lookouts on the Tiller Ranger District. Today Acker Rock and Pickett Butte are the only remaining lookouts on the District.

In areas commonly home to grizzly bears and wolves you’ll be glad to be camping in the sky.

If the amenities are a little too basic for your liking and you’re looking for an upgrade I did find one rather fancy fire tower available for rent on Airbnb naturally….

It’s located in Tiller Oregon and goes for $175 a night.

If something a little more authentic (and around $20 a night) is more in your bag I’d invite you spend some time going through this list of fire towers to rent.

An investigation is underway but who regulates these parks?,"CNN —

Questions always arise when tragedy strikes.

So when a 14-year-old boy fell to his death on March 24 on an amusement park ride in Orlando Florida there were questions about who should be held responsible and how the incident happened in the first place.

Tyre Sampson fell from the Orlando FreeFall drop tower which takes riders up and then drops them nearly 400 feet at speeds that reach more than 75 mph according to ICON Park where the incident happened.

Two seats on the FreeFall were manually adjusted “presumably to allow for larger riders” according to an April 18 statement by state Rep. Geraldine Thompson based on a report produced by Quest Engineering & Failure Analysis Inc. a forensic engineering firm hired to investigate the incident.

One of the ride’s seats had been loosened adjusted and tightened for a restraint that was 4 inches more than the normal opening range the report said. The FreeFall manufacturer’s guideline puts a rider’s weight limit at 250 pounds.

“My son was 6’5 340. So he’s a big guy” said Tyre’s father Yarnell Sampson.

His death is being investigated by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services along with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office and ICON Park.

In an effort to gain a better understanding of the larger issue of regulation in the amusement park industry CNN examined safety reports and spoke with experts about park operations and why they don’t have federal oversight.

Who regulates amusement parks?

Typically state agencies have oversight according to Randy King a safety consultant based in Houston Texas who has over 30 years of experience in the safety and amusement park industry.

When it comes to standardization of safety at parks the industry relies on ASTM International an organization that develops and publishes standards for a number of industries including amusement parks he said.

Additionally “almost everyone in the amusement industry” belongs to the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) a trade group representing amusement parks according to King.

The ASTM committee handling amusement parks meets twice a year according to the organization’s website. The IAAPA releases a safety report annually for parks and holds expos and training for member organizations.

What’s the history behind the regulation system?

A state’s department of agriculture normally regulates amusement parks or at least fixed (or immovable) rides according to Martin Lewison an associate professor at Farmingdale University in New York who was dubbed by The New York Times as “Professor Roller Coaster.”

That’s because parks began as traveling businesses that would turn up at US agricultural fairs – farmers would show up with a prized pumpkin or cow and then a showman brought the rides Lewison said.

“It was always the agricultural institutions that were in charge of these sorts of events and that led to a modern-day regulatory structure where – in most states – some branch of the state department of agriculture has oversight over fixed rides” he said.

As the size of the amusement park industry ballooned in the last century some elements came under federal supervision. But the industry balked at the oversight.

“(The) industry pushed back for many years on federal oversight on fixed amusement rides” Lewiston said.

In the early 1980s Congress determined that the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission was only responsible for traveling rides.

The so-called “Roller-Coaster Loophole” did not sit well with some lawmakers. In 2001 then US Rep. (now Sen.) Edward Markey of Massachusetts called for oversight to be restored to the CPSC. Markey initially began his crusade to close the loophole in 1999 and has been looking to close it since.

“The reason there is no national clearinghouse to prevent ride injuries is clear – since 1981 the industry has escaped routine product safety regulation through a loophole in the law” he said.

So why aren’t amusement parks federally regulated?

King and Lewison say the answer to this is simple: The industry would not benefit from federal oversight.

“It could make things worse” King said adding that getting the federal government involved does not make things better.

To that point Lewison said involvement from the feds would cost the industry too much.

“They would have to now deal separately with a federal regulatory agency that would suddenly become responsible for every fixed-site amusement ride in the United States” he said.

There are thousands of fixed amusement rides across the country many of which are family entertainment centers with go-karts and/or a kiddy roller coaster.

“The industry obviously doesn’t want that extra cost of dealing with a new set of rules and regulations because a lot of these companies are small companies that don’t make a huge amount of profits. There’s only so many Six Flags and Disneys out there” Lewison said.

“So for them it’s fairly easy to accommodate additional costs. But for many small businesses which is the majority of the industry any additional costs can be devastating in terms of their bottom line” he said.

Both King and Lewison told CNN they thought state agencies were doing a great job regulating amusement parks.

“Safety culture is already heavily built into the industry” Lewison said.

How often do people die on amusement park rides?

It’s very rare for someone to die let alone get injured on a ride at an amusement park. The safety record of the amusement park industry is amazing Lewison said and ride designers are serious about their work and safety.

“The amusement industry operates with the understanding that one injury is one too many and there is an impressive effort made by industry safety professionals to enhance safety at our facilities” said Jim Seay president of the Baltimore-based Premier Rides and a member of the IAAPA safety committee.

“Ride fatalities are extremely rare which is why like a plane crash they are covered widely in the news” Seay said. “Statistically you are safer riding the rides at an amusement park than most other forms of recreation and even the drive to the park although that doesn’t stop the efforts of industry safety experts to focus on making the industry even safer.”

The odds of being seriously injured on a fixed-site ride in the US is 1 in 15.5 million the IAAPA said.

In other words there are more chances of a person dying by bee stings or from a dog attack than being injured on an amusement park ride according to statistics from the National Safety Council.

A 2020 IAAPA North American Ride Safety Report – in which it surveyed 162 facilities – said a majority (60%) of injuries came from family and adult rides.

The report also said there were 341 ridership-based injuries though the report also added that the number is significantly lower than 2019 (1294) because of the Covid-19 pandemic’s effect on the amusement industry in 2020.

“These sorts of accidents are extraordinarily rare” Lewison said. “You’re still more likely to die falling off a chair than dying on an amusement ride.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvYW1lcmljYXMvb3JsYW5kby10aGVtZS1wYXJrLWRlYXRoLXRvd2VyLXdlaWdodC1iMjA1MDA1OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teen who fell to death from theme park ride was over weight limit report says,"The latest headlines from our reporters across the US sent straight to your inbox each weekday Your briefing on the latest headlines from across the US Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers events and updates from The Independent.

A teenager who fell to his death from a 430ft high Florida theme park ride may have been to heavy to go on the attraction.

Tyre Sampson’s family say that the 6ft5 14-year-old weighed 340 pounds while the maximum weight for the FreeFall ride at Orlando’s ICON Park was 287 pounds according to its manual.

“Be careful when seeing if large guests fit into the seats. Check that they fit within the contours of the seat and that the bracket fits properly. If this is not so do not let this person ride” the manual reads.

The youngster was killed while visiting Florida on a spring break trip with his football team from St Louis Missouri.

His father Yarnell Sampson told the MailOnline that his son was “a big guy” and had not been allowed on other rides at the park because of his size.

“This one particular ride said ‘We can take you come on! Get on!’ No one else allowed him to get on the ride so I’m wondering what happened between now and then that made them say ‘Come on get this ride!’” Mr Sampson told Fox35 last week.

Mr Sampson added that Sampson said his son was an aspiring football player who had a bright future.

The Orange County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the 24 March death and no criminal charges have yet been filed.

The ride which only opened in December remains closed as the investigation continues.

An incident report sent from the ride manufacturers to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services stated that the “harness was still in a down and locked position when the ride stopped” and that Sampson came out of his seat according to CNN.

The report states that Sampson came out of his seat when the magnets engaged to slow the ride down during its descent according to the news network.

“We are not going to jump to any conclusions until the information is provided to us and all the facts are known” said Nikki Fried Commissioner of the FDACS."
AWK,American Water Works,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvbmF0aW9uL25hdGl2ZS1hbWVyaWNhbi10cmliZXMtc2Vlay1tb3JlLWluY2x1c2lvbi1hY3Rpb24tZnJvbS11LXMtb2ZmaWNpYWxz0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGJzLm9yZy9uZXdzaG91ci9hbXAvbmF0aW9uL25hdGl2ZS1hbWVyaWNhbi10cmliZXMtc2Vlay1tb3JlLWluY2x1c2lvbi1hY3Rpb24tZnJvbS11LXMtb2ZmaWNpYWxz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Native American tribes seek more inclusion action from U.S. officials,"ALBUQUERQUE N.M. (AP) — It was a quick trip for U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland with stops to hike through desert scrub near the U.S.-Mexico border and to marvel at the jagged Organ Mountains before soaking in what life was like in one of the oldest settlements along a historic trade route.

For Haaland the time spent in West Texas and New Mexico over recent days helped to highlight the work being done to conserve parts of the borderlands.

But it also marked an opportunity for Haaland — as head of the agency that has broad oversight of tribal affairs — to deliver on promises to meet with Native American tribes that have grown increasingly frustrated about the federal government’s failure to include them when making decisions about land management energy development or the protection of sacred sites.

Haaland’s selection as the first Native American to serve in the position opened a door for tribes who pointed to a history fraught with broken promises.

“I want the era where tribes have been on the back burner to be over and I want to make sure that they have real opportunities to have a seat at the table” Haaland said on March 17 2021 her first day on the job.

Haaland has since met with nearly 130 of the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes as she seeks to overhaul a federal system that has limited Native American relations to a check-the-box exercise.

And while some tribes say her aspirations are admirable others remain skeptical they will see real change and say they have yet to experience meaningful dialogue with the federal government or key decision makers.

Haaland’s department has developed a plan for improving formal consultations with tribes and established an advisory committee that will aid with communication once it’s up and running. In an effort to make consultation a hallmark of her tenure Haaland has said she wants integration of tribal input to become second nature for her employees.

There has been some success as tribes felt heard when the Biden administration restored the original boundaries of Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and when the U.S. Department of Agriculture pulled back an environmental impact statement that paved the way for an Arizona copper mining operation to consult further with tribes.

But frustrations persist among tribal leaders who say their conversations with the federal government have not resulted in action on the ground.

For the Ute Indian Tribe in Utah those frustrations lie in management of the Colorado River basin as western states grapple with less water amid a megadrought and climate change. Tribes were not included in a century-old compact that divvied up the water and the Ute tribe says it’s seeing the same exclusion now.

The tribe’s Business Committee has spent hours in meetings and preparing formal comments and says it’s tired of having to reiterate its position that the federal government must protect the tribe’s water rights or support development of water infrastructure to serve the reservation.

Committee Chairman Shaun Chapoose said he’s seen proposals but “actual where-the-rubber-meets-the-road stuff hasn’t occurred yet and the drought gets worse.”

There are similar sentiments among Navajo Nation lawmakers who are concerned about Haaland’s plans to make oil and gas development off-limits on federal land surrounding Chaco Culture National Historical Park in northwestern New Mexico.

Advocacy groups sent a letter to Haaland on Thursday saying more needs to be done to include tribes as her department charts a path forward for protecting culturally significant areas in northwestern New Mexico.

The Interior Department said more meetings with the Navajo Nation and other tribes are planned in April and that Navajo-language translators will be present.

In Nevada several tribes and the National Congress of American Indians have asked the Interior Department and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to uphold a duty to engage in “robust and adequate” tribal consultation regarding plans for a massive lithium mine at Thacker Pass. So far the tribes say that hasn’t happened.

Under the U.S. Constitution treaties and statutes the federal government must consult meaningfully and in good faith with Native American and Alaska Native tribes when making decisions or taking action that is expected to impact them.

However a 2019 report from a government watchdog found some federal agencies lacked respect for tribal sovereignty didn’t have enough resources for consultation or couldn’t always reach tribes.

Another top complaint from tribes is that they are brought in when a course of action already has been set instead of including them in the earliest phases of planning.

“The federal government says all the right words but their mentality is one in which they are not really doing this in a way that reflects the proper government-to-government relationship that I think tribes are orienting to when they enter into these conversations” said Justin Richland a professor at the University of California-Irvine School of Social Sciences who specializes in Native American law and politics.

Consultation doesn’t always lead to action or create any substantive rights on the part of the tribes making it somewhat of a “toothless tiger” said Dylan Hedden-Nicely a citizen of the Cherokee Nation who directs the Native American Law Program at the University of Idaho.

He said it’s reasonable although incorrect to think things would move quickly with Haaland — a member of Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico — because she had a base of knowledge about Indian Country when she took the office. But the groundwork is still being laid to effectuate real change Hedden-Nicely said.

“It’s not immediate but it’s going to be worth the wait I’m hoping” he said.

During Haaland’s confirmation hearings Interior staff consulted with tribes on how to improve the process.

“Secretary Haaland and the entire department take our commitment to strengthening tribal sovereignty and self-governance seriously and we have affirmed that robust consultations are the cornerstones of federal Indian policy” department spokesman Tyler Cherry said in a statement to The Associated Press.

President Joe Biden issued a memo during his first month in office reaffirming previous executive orders on tribal consultation and directing federal agencies to spell out how they’ll comply. That set in motion Haaland’s efforts to give tribal leaders a direct line of communication to the Interior Department.

A congressional committee is scheduled next week to consider a bill by Democratic U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva of Arizona that would codify a framework for tribal consultation that supporters say would insulate the process from changes in administration.

The legislation faces an uphill battle and some tribes want to ensure that it includes a pathway not only for the federal government to initiate consultation but for tribal leaders to start conversations too. Similar legislation introduced in the past has failed.

For Amber Torres chair of the Walker River Paiute Tribe in Nevada consultation should be more than a generic letter or email.

“I want true meaningful face-to-face dialogue with a timeline intent and follow-up and next steps agreed by both parties” she said. “Making the tribal consultation process a law is long overdue and it would be a step in the right direction to ensure tribal nation sovereignty is protected.”

Findings from a new Cleveland Clinic-led phase 1 trial show that an experimental “gene silencing” therapy reduced blood levels of lipoprotein(a) a key driver of heart disease risk by up to 98%.

Findings from the “APOLLO Trial: Magnitude and Duration of Effects of a Short-interfering RNA Targeting Lipoprotein(a): A Placebo-controlled Double-blind Dose-ranging Trial” were presented today during a late-breaking science session at the American College of Cardiology’s 71st Annual Scientific Session and simultaneously published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Steven E. Nissen M.D.

In the trial participants who received higher doses of SLN360 – a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic that “silences” the gene responsible for lipoprotein(a) production – saw their lipoprotein(a) levels drop by as much as 96%-98%. Five months later these participants’ lipoprotein(a) – also known as Lp(a) – levels remained 71%-81% lower than baseline.

The findings suggest this siRNA therapy could be a promising treatment to help prevent premature heart disease in people with high levels of Lp(a) which is estimated to affect 64 million people in the United States and 1.4 billion people worldwide. It is estimated that nearly 20 to 25% of the world’s population has elevated Lp(a).

“These results showed the safety and strong efficacy of this experimental treatment at reducing levels of Lp(a) a common but previously untreatable genetically-determined risk factor that leads to premature heart attack stroke and aortic stenosis” said the study’s lead author Steven E. Nissen M.D. Chief Academic Officer of the Heart Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic. “We hope that further development of this therapy also will be shown to reduce the consequences of Lp(a) in the clinical setting through future studies.”

Lp(a) has similarities to LDL also known as bad cholesterol. Lp(a) is made in the liver where an extra protein called apolipoprotein(a) is attached to an LDL-like particle. Unlike other types of cholesterol particles Lp(a) levels are 80 to 90% genetically determined. The structure of the Lp(a) particle causes the accumulation of plaques in arteries which play a significant role in heart disease. Elevated Lp(a) greatly increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Although effective therapies to reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering LDL cholesterol and other lipids exist currently there are no approved treatments to lower Lp(a). Since Lp(a) levels are determined by a person’s genes lifestyle changes such as diet or exercise have no effect. In the current study the siRNA therapy reduces Lp(a) levels by “silencing” the gene responsible for Lp(a) production and blocking creation of apolipoprotein(a) in the liver.

In the APOLLO trial researchers enrolled 32 people at five medical centers in three countries. All participants had Lp(a) levels above 150 nmol/L with a median level of 224 nmol/L (75 nmol/L or less is considered normal). Eight participants received a placebo and the remaining received one of four doses of SLN360 via a single subcutaneous injection. The doses were 30 mg 100 mg 300 mg and 600 mg. Participants were closely observed for the first 24 hours after their injection and then assessed periodically for five months.

Participants receiving 300 mg and 600 mg of SLN360 had a maximum of 96% and 98% reduction in Lp(a) levels and a reduction of 71% and 81% at five months compared to baseline. Those receiving a placebo saw no change in Lp(a) levels. The highest doses also reduced LDL cholesterol by about 20%-25%. There were no major safety consequences reported and the most common side effect was temporary soreness at the injection site. The study was extended and researchers will continue to follow participants for a total of one year.

The APOLLO trial was funded by Silence Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq: SLN) London UK. Dr. Nissen has served as a consultant for many pharmaceutical companies and has overseen clinical trials for Amgen AstraZeneca Bristol Myers Squibb Eli Lilly Esperion Novartis Novo Nordisk Orexigen Takeda and Pfizer. However he does not accept honoraria consulting fees or other compensation from commercial entities.

The trial was coordinated by the Cleveland Clinic Coordinating Center for Clinical Research (C5Research) and sponsored by Silence Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq: SLN) London UK.",,,,,,,,,,,,

She’d have to sing (here to a backing track) for 40 minutes accompanied by six to eight dancers; the contract stipulated she’d be furnished with “first-class” sound and lights. No recording or taping of the performance would be allowed. But no tickets were sold either. And the payday stood out too: $1.25 million. To celebrate the birthday of a relative a wealthy Chinese family flew Lopez to Asia to perform for them tossing in $500000 for airfare and hotel for her and her entourage. The opulence didn’t stop there; for the show the family built a restaurant and a nightclub inside a Grand Hyatt ballroom with a walkway connecting the two. And all for about 20 people in the audience less than the number of crew members involved in working on the gig.

For more than 20 years pop stars of all genres and generations from Bob Dylan and the Eagles to Alicia Keys and John Legend have been hired to play corporate events — big-paycheck performances for company employees or clients often at theaters or arenas. Even during a pandemic when live performances slowed down that ecosystem has persisted. Last December the blockchain-gaming platform Gala Games threw a “Galaverse” multinight private party in San Francisco where its 500 guests gathered to hear Maroon 5 Alice Cooper DJ Steve Aoki a bit of Snoop Dogg and a stripped-down set by two members of Arcade Fire. The venue included private rooms set up to look like a medieval tavern a “Dungeons & Dragons” setup with a huge fake dragon and a quasi Texas dance hall while in another space dancers were made up to look like zombies (to tie in with a Walking Dead game).

But alongside the world of corporate parties and retreats a far more shadowy parallel world has been flourishing: the super-private gig. In that universe stars in classic rock hip-hop and pop have been pulling in sizable fees for playing at weddings birthday parties anniversaries and other personal-life milestones all for those wealthy enough to afford it. The festivities allow performers to walk away with yacht-loads of cash and make one-percenter hosts feel like insiders and stars themselves. But along with the sizable paydays come sometimes dicey political issues that the artists have to navigate (or sometimes ignore).

Editor’s picks

In the early days of this industry the only performers who would bite were oldies acts from the Fifties or Sixties. But today the list of artists who’ve taken the money and played now reads like a pop chart. Fork over the right amount as much as seven figures and Beyoncé or Rod Stewart might play for your friends and family. The lineup includes veterans like John Mayer and newcomers like Charlie Puth (who was a surprise guest at a teenager’s bat mitzvah in Boston). Sugar Ray are available as is the semi-supergroup Ezra Ray Hart composed of Sugar Ray’s Mark McGrath Tonic frontman Emerson Hart and Better Than Ezra’s Kevin Griffin who will rock your house with a slew of Nineties hits. Pitbull Nicki Minaj and Flo Rida have played bar or bat mitzvahs.

In a sign of generational changes old-school hip-hop acts like Coolio Too Short Vanilla Ice and Naughty by Nature have also been hired for such up-close-and-personal shows. “We’re seeing a lot of people who host a big-name artist in their mansions” says Jay Siegan whose company Jay Siegan Presents has helped book major acts like Coldplay and Celine Dion for corporate events. “They do it discreetly and for 30 to 50 friends and they’ll have a million-dollar artist perform 45 minutes before they have a celebrity chef prepare a dinner. That’s the kind of thing we’ve seen more and more of.”

Sugar Ray recently partook in a birthday party for a wealthy client in San Diego who rented out a club for a few dozen of his friends. “You go out you play for the 40 people and they’re having drinks having fun going crazy” says McGrath who says he earns roughly half of his annual income from such events. “Some of those you have to work really hard; you’re not getting the response you’re used to getting in your hard-ticket shows and it might hurt your ego a little bit. That’s also a reason why you’re getting paid three or four times what you normally get paid.”

If none of this sounds familiar there’s a reason. In an atmosphere where poverty and the unequal distribution of wealth are part of the national conversation a new degree of secrecy has kicked in. Few artists are willing to discuss these jobs and the people who book the parties often sign agreements not to disclose any details about the performers host or locale. Meanwhile the artists themselves aren’t just cashing the checks but also grappling with who they play for and how much detail to reveal. “Some kind of opportunity was extended and we obliged” says one pop star of a recent event where he played. “The thing about private parties is if you’re not there a lot of the details you don’t really want to discuss too much. That’s what allows it to maintain certain levels of exclusivity.”

Sugar Ray’s McGrath remembers the day he stumbled upon this new ecosystem. It was the late Nineties the band’s “Fly” was dominating the radio and they were offered a gig playing for a tech company in the Bay Area. “They had all these lasers and six different rooms with a DJ in one room and about 30 disinterested people milling about” he recalls. “You’ve just kind of got to grind through it.” But he also remembers the payday — “seven times what we’d ever seen before” — and how the show left a mark. “We said ‘This world is kind of fun’ ” he says. “Back then corporate parties or fairs were considered taboo — you were not cool if you did those things. We were never cool. So we didn’t have anything to worry about.”

That era roughly 25 years ago marked the dawn of the corporate gig for classic rock when six- or seven-figure fees would entice Stewart Billy Joel or Crosby Stills and Nash to play a show for company employees at corporate behemoths like Pepsi and Bank of America. In 1998 thanks to a reported just-under-a-million-dollars paycheck Bob and Jakob Dylan co-headlined a show (for the technology-hardware manufacturer Applied Materials) for the first and only time.

The dot-com boom of the early 2000s took the private-party circuit to a new level. Jesus Jones’ Mike Edwards recalls the time his band a decade after its heyday was flown from the U.K. to the States to play a corporate conference — and all they had to do was play their lone hit “Right Here Right Now” at the beginning of the event. “The host said ‘Welcome everyone hope you have a good time and here’s Jesus Jones’ ” Edwards recalls. “We played 360 seconds and the costs were minimal.. … There was always the subtle undertone of ‘You’re dancing with the devil’ or somehow you’re a corporate whore. But we got to play a song of ours that we quite liked and come home with a load of money. You think ‘Why wouldn’t you?’ ”

The 2008 crash put the brakes on these fees but according to talent bookers as the economy began to improve over the past decade those events picked up where they left off and the super-private category — where the well-off are able to bring in a rock legend here a pop icon there to commemorate a special life moment — began to ramp up. Seal played aboard a yacht off the coast of Monaco for the members of a family who own a prominent airline. In 2018 Beyoncé was reportedly paid in the millions at the wedding of the children of two Indian billionaires. Around the same time a one-percenter financier based in Utah constructed a full-on concert stage in his backyard to host Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers. The host spent more than $1 million to fly in chefs from the O2 arena in London and turned his multicar garage into an industrial kitchen. Due to the altitude EMTs supplied with oxygen tanks were also on hand.

The Rodgers event was organized by Element Lifestyle a private firm that charges its high-end clients a $48000 yearly membership to help them with travel and vacation arrangements — and increasingly music events. In one of those deals Ricky Martin was paid $500000 to take the 10-minute drive from his Los Angeles home to sing at a wedding. A client from Iran a fledgling singer himself had a lifelong dream to duet with Andrea Bocelli and for around $1 million the crooner was flown in from Italy to join the host onstage in Los Angeles. (Another client by way of Siegan paid for Bocelli to make a surprise visit to his company’s retreat in Italy.) “In the pre-Covid world there were clients who love music and love the live-music experience but don’t necessarily love the thousands of people they’re surrounded by” says Element Lifestyle founder Michael Albanese. “So this idea of creating an experience in their backyard or their home started to really take off.”

According to Robert Norman a CAA agent who helped pioneer this music ecosystem decades ago another rich dude built “unique venues” for multiple party nights at his home. “We’re not talking about putting up a tent” says Norman who declines to mention the name of the host or the acts who played. “These were tiki lodges and a New Orleans–style blues house.”

Not everyone accepts the offers. According to a source a one-percenter was willing to pay $250000 to ride motorcycles with Bruce Springsteen or hire him for a private concert. Springsteen supposedly declined. U2 are requested regularly but according to Siegan “U2 is one where I just have to tell my clients no.” But those acts are increasingly in the music-world minority. “Some artists make their fees so high that people will say no to it” says Albanese. “But everyone has a price at the end of the day.”

In 2018 during the prepandemic party gold rush Bob McLynn of Crush Management which handles Fall Out Boy private-party regulars Train and others was taking his boat out for a spin off the Jersey shore when he came across dozens of boats parked in the water. Nearby was a carnival complete with a Ferris wheel. “I yelled to one of the boats ‘Who’s playing over there?’ ” McLynn says. “The guy says ‘Who!’ I said ‘Who’s playing over there?’ And he’s like ‘The Who!’ ”

It was actually Roger Daltrey performing with his own band in a tent for the New Jersey real-estate mogul Steve Silverman. “If you had told me they were playing a guy’s backyard over here I’d be like ‘No way — they’re in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame’ ” McLynn says. “ ‘What do they need to play a private gig for?’ But they’re all doing it.”

When live music went into lockdown in March 2020 so did the private-gig world. But it didn’t completely shut down: During the height of the pandemic artists including Sting Leon Bridges Keith Urban Christina Aguilera and Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic were hired for virtual private concerts for fees starting at just under $100000 and rising into the mid six figures.

But last year as concerts began returning to some degree of normalcy the way-under-the-radar bookings began to increase. This year CAA alone has more than 700 events (both private and corporate) planned each featuring one of its music acts. (Norman declines to specify which but the company’s roster includes Lionel Richie Bon Jovi the Doobie Brothers and Earth Wind and Fire.) According to two leading talent agencies corporate-party gigs once accounted for the bulk of such exclusive shows about 75 percent but private ones are inching up from 25 to 40 percent of that combined income. “There are so many great opportunities out there and more to come” says manager Michael Lippman one of whose acts Matchbox Twenty has hit the private-party circuit. “It’s much bigger now than it was then.” Sometimes the party hosts initiate the discussions reaching out to talent agencies — and finding the right match of music audience and remuneration.

Even as Omicron was starting to hit last fall the music and the festivities didn’t completely stop. In December Lenny Kravitz and the controversial rapper T.I. were hired for undisclosed fees to play at a waterfront property in Miami owned by flush art collector and coal-family scion Wayne Boich. The occasion was Richard Mille After Dark celebrating the high-end Swiss watchmaker. To a crowd that included Venus and Serena Williams Leonardo DiCaprio and Wolf of Wall Street inspiration Jordan Belfort Kravitz emerged to play a set followed at midnight by T.I. — as a yacht pulled up alongside to watch them.

Thanks to confidentiality agreements the fees collected by the artists can be hard to pin down: They can range from five-figure deals to what one booker calls “six- or seven-figure situations” for pop icons. “I am constantly coaching my clients through their sticker shock” says Siegan citing a seven-figure price tag from Bruno Mars; another source says Mars can command as much as $4 million.

“Probably bands that were a little hesitant to do them are more willing to now” says McGrath. “[The hosts] usually have their own Covid protocol and there are less people involved. You’re not carrying your crew you’re not carrying buses so it’s high reward less risk. And so what’s not to love about that? A lot of them are destination events in Cabo the Bahamas Hawaii. It’s like ‘Yeah twist my arm.’ ”

For some musicians the appeal isn’t always financial. “The private events will try to cater to the artist more than the average promoter” says Kevin Monty of Red Light Management which manages Phish the Dave Matthews Band Valerie June and many others. “Give them nicer wine or access to lodging that might be exclusive and the catering is better than a club gig.” Artists can make their own demands — like in rare instances no dancing during their sets. “It’s a great way to network and exchange ideas with people who may be like-minded but not in the same professional arena as you” says one artist who’s played a private show.

Whether they want to entertain the thought or not pop acts are newly reconsidering super-private shows thanks to Covid: They may want to compensate for lost touring revenue help support their crew keep up their chops augment their low streaming income or all of the above. “There are probably some artists out there who will try to make up for lost time and be a bit more active than they might have otherwise been” says Red Light’s Monty. “People have a sense of obligation to their band and crew to give them the opportunity to work. That was largely taken away but now is the chance.” Adds Siegan “It’s such a significant revenue stream for bands who are in demand. I’m frankly amazed by artists who shy away from this particularly in this new music economy where there’s less revenue from record sales.”

But with the uptick in such gigs and the outsize paychecks has come a new code of silence. Increasingly musicians and party planners have to sign nondisclosure agreements. Through their representatives many of these artists declined to discuss the events or fees with Rolling Stone or did not respond to requests to do so; the same with some of the higher-profile hosts.

In some cases guests have had to hand over their cellphones to avoid photos leaking on social media. “It’s super-confidential” says agent Greg Janese of UTA which also books many of its clients for private events like Pitbull Flo Rida and other contemporary acts. “We get a lot of offers for upper-high-end private parties where you get to sign a nondisclosure. People just don’t want it out that they’re booking these kinds of parties.”

In the U.K. the catering company Global Infusion Group (and its offshoot Eat to the Beat) has provided food for many such events. Among the most recent was a wedding at a castle with a major pop act — and that’s all CEO Bonnie May can say about it. “For some certain clients that love the confidentiality it’s a great attraction in terms of working for us and we are really really strict” May says. “There is just a no-go area in terms of sharing that on social media.”

Given the way that those in the field predict business will go in the next few years it’s unlikely that such a veil of secrecy will be lifted anytime soon. “When things started to return to ‘normal’ whatever the hell that is it still wasn’t considered prudent to be throwing lavish parties” Siegan says. “That said there is an air of excitement with many of our clients around throwing parties impressing their friends and colleagues and just going over the top again. It feels like an impending Roaring Twenties.”

In 2005 David H. Brooks whose company built bulletproof vests for the military hired Stevie Nicks Steven Tyler and Joe Perry Tom Petty the Eagles 50 Cent Nelly and others for a bat mitzvah for his teenage daughter paying some of them in the low millions. Two years later he was arrested for (among other allegations) insider trading and using company money to pay for his lavish lifestyle; he was serving 17 years in prison before his death in 2016. “This guy ended up being a crook and it was a nightmare” says Janese who was working at the time with Tyler and Nicks. “It was just a bummer that that happened.”

Organizing private-bash events can be a headache on any number of levels which sometimes includes transforming someone’s house into a concert space. “You need an experienced production manager” says manager Jonathan Wolfson whose clients such as Hall and Oates have played private parties (including one at a Long Island estate where Hall and Oates were joined onstage by Jamie Foxx). “There are safety issues. Sometimes stages have to be built and not everyone’s backyard is set up for an event.” In 2016 Sia was offered $1 million for a backyard event in St. Barts for which the host was prepared to build a dance floor and canopy with a clear roof. But in the end Sia pulled out when her camp realized that the small outdoor space couldn’t accommodate her full normal production and dancers.

Vetting the people putting up the money is even more complicated. Given that the $10 million Brooks used for his daughter’s party was cited by the Justice Department as one of his financial misuses the incident reveals the potential red flags involved in such paydays. In 2013 Lopez sang “Happy Birthday” to the president of Turkmenistan the Central Asia nation just north of Iran. There according to the Human Rights Watch report that year “human rights defenders and other activists face the constant threat of government reprisal. The government continues to use imprisonment as a tool for political retaliation.” (The report also cited President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow’s “cult of personality.”) After receiving backlash for the show which was held at a lavish resort in the country Lopez’s camp issued a statement that “had there been knowledge of human rights issues of any kind Jennifer would not have attended.”

According to a source Billie Eilish was offered seven figures for a Middle Eastern gig and passed. Train turned down a big-payday show in that part of the world as well. “It was a guy who made money in the diamond business” says McLynn “and we didn’t feel comfortable doing it.”

“Some artists are more selective and want to know all about who they’re performing for more so for the private events” says Adam Grayson of the talent booking agency GrayRock Entertainment which helps arrange for musical acts to play for clients. “They’re not going to just blindly go into something and often they do want to know the politics. Some don’t care some do.”

In the meantime the circuit isn’t going anywhere and neither are the paychecks. Matchbox Twenty and Sugar Ray this year are each booked for weddings in the Bahamas and Canada respectively. McGrath does specify that playing a wedding doesn’t mean he’ll be introducing the couple or playing a first-dance song. “They’ll have a big hall or a club and we’ll play” he says. “It’s not Adam Sandler in The Wedding Singer. But I’m not saying that’s not going to be my future.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6b25hbm8uY29tL2FydGljbGUuYXNweD9BcnRpY2xlSUQ9NTk0N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greenhouse Gas Mitigation with Nanocrystalline Perovskites,"Dry reforming of methane (DRM) has been demonstrated to help in greenhouse gas mitigation. However a proper catalyst is required for catalytic activity and stability during DRM. Research published in the MDPI journal molecules investigated the effect of strontium incorporation into cerium- and nickel-based nanocrystalline perovskites for greenhouse gas mitigation strategies.

Dry reforming of methane (DRM) among the other CO 2 conversion has garnered attention majorly because DRM converts major greenhouse gases—methane and carbon dioxide—to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide which is then used to produce liquid hydrocarbons.

The DRM process plays a role in greenhouse gas mitigation and serves as a cause of climate change. However it also produces synthesis gas a mixture of equimolar hydrogen and carbon monoxide appropriate for the synthesis of hydrocarbon with the help of the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis process.

Both transition metal-based and noble metal-based catalysts are utilized but transition metal-based catalysts like Nickel (Ni)- and cobalt (Co)-based catalysts are most analyzed for DRM as they are inexpensive abundant and provide quick turnover rates. Ni-based catalysts become deactivated during DRM a major challenge to be overcome.

Metallic nanoparticles supported on basic oxide supports or promoters show enhanced catalytic activity and benefit CO 2 chemisorption. Nickel-based double-layered hydroxides (LDHs) in addition to the metallic nanoparticle-supported oxides have demonstrated better catalytic performances towards DRM reaction. However they eventually deactivate owing to the rapid growth of randomly sized impregnated nanoparticles.

The current study shows the effect of incorporation of strontium (Sr) into cerium- and nickel-based nanocrystalline perovskites (CeNiO 3 ) in both dry and/or CO 2 reforming of methane. The research concentrates on analyzing the insights of the replacement of cerium with strontium and the impact of this replacement on catalytic conversions and durability.

Results

The thermal decomposition curves which include thermogravimetric (TG) and the differentials (DTG) of the precursors as a measurement of their calcination temperatures are depicted in Figure 1. It can be observed that each precursor decomposed differently.

The XRD patterns of the as-prepared nanocrystalline perovskites without and with the incorporation are illustrated in Figure 2. MDI Jade® software was employed to analyze XRD data and a substantial number of peaks corresponding to CeNiO 3 were recorded.

Figure 3 reveals the N 2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the pore-size distributions of air-calcined precursors (700 °C 5 hours). Figure 3 depicts that all of the samples showed a type II isotherm with an H3 hysteresis loop indicating that these samples had macro-pores.

The morphology of the nanocrystalline perovskite catalysts (fresh reduced and used) were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 4 shows the images of the catalysts before and after the reaction. The particles were spherical in shape. Insignificant sintering was noted for reduced catalysts.

Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR) is majorly used to investigate the metal–support interaction the reducibility and to identify the activation and/or reduction temperature. Figure 5 shows the reduction profiles denoting the differences in metal–support interaction and/or the reducibility of CeNiO 3 after Sr addition.

The carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) conversions versus time-on-stream are depicted in Figure 6. It was noted that CO 2 conversions greater than CH 4 conversions were responsible for side reactions including reverse water–gas-shift reaction and reverse CO disproportionation.

The likelihood of carbon formation over the catalyst’s surface after a dry-reforming reaction was shown by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis (see Figure 7). A single broad peak was observed in the temperature range of 110 °C to 500 °C for each catalyst.

The TEM microscopic images were recorded after a dry-reforming reaction to comprehend the morphological changes and also the formation of deactivating coke above the surface of spent catalysts.

Discussion

Ahead of the dry methane-reforming reaction analysis the as-prepared nanocrystalline perovskites were characterized. The mechanism connected with dry methane reforming needs reactant adsorption over the active sites of the catalyst. However in spite of higher activity CeNiO 3 perovskite deactivated over time these observations were substantiated by TEM and TPO.

But strontium-incorporated perovskites did not deactivate in spite of carbon deposition and sintering. The degree of agglomeration or sintering was the same for all perovskites. This indicates that methane decomposition a prevalent DRM side reaction at the higher reaction temperature is the major source of carbon deposition resulting in catalyst deactivation. Figure 8 illustrates the reaction mechanism and the impact of Sr incorporation.

Earlier studies inferred that Sr incorporation in lesser amounts showed less-active but stable catalytic performance and Table 2 compares the observations of this study with earlier works. It was seen that the current conversions outperformed similar perovskites.

Methodology

Nanocrystalline perovskites—Ce x Sr 1−x NiO 3 (x = 0.6–1)—were produced through the self-combustion method. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the perovskite precursors was documented with a thermal analyzer. X-ray diffraction profiles were recorded and BET specific surface areas of the samples were evaluated.

The morphology of both fresh and used perovskite catalysts was examined by transmission electron microscopy and TPO and TPR profiles were conducted. The as-synthesized catalysts’ chemical compositions were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy.

The dry methane-reforming reaction was carried out in a tubular fixed-bed reactor at 700 °C and 1 atm pressure. The feed gas was flown at 70 mL/min and the catalysts were subjected to activation/reduction before the reaction. The hydrogen mixture was replaced with helium after activation to remove any leftover hydrogen.

Conclusion

The current study showed the catalytic performance results of strontium-incorporated nanocrystalline perovskites for dry methane reforming. The observations reveal the major role of strontium incorporation in Ce x Sr 1−x NiO 3 (x = 0.6–1) perovskites to ascertain stable catalytic performance for prolonged periods to avoid deactivation.

""This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions & China zero Covid policy"" Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted. ""Outstanding work by Tesla team & key suppliers saved the day.""

Tesla delivered 310048 vehicles in the quarter a slight increase from the previous quarter and up 68% from a year earlier. Wall Street had expected deliveries of 308836 cars according to Refinitiv data.

Tesla produced 305407 vehicles from January to March down from 305840 the previous quarter.

Tesla the world's most valuable automaker has navigated the pandemic and supply chain disruptions better than rivals and its new Shanghai factory has been driving growth.

But a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in China has forced Tesla to temporarily suspend production at the Shanghai factory for several days in March and April as the city locks down to test residents for the disease.

The deliveries were ""better than feared given supply chain issues"" said Daniel Ives an analyst at Wedbush in a report.

Tesla said it sold a total of 295324 Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport utility vehicles while it delivered 14724 Model S luxury sedans and Model X premium SUVs.

PRICE HIKE

Skyrocketing gas prices spurred by the Ukraine crisis is expected to fuel demand for electric cars but lack of inventory and higher vehicle prices would weigh on sales analysts said.

Tesla in March raised prices in China and the United States after Musk said the U.S. electric carmaker was facing significant inflationary pressure in raw materials and logistics after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Impressive (deliveries) given all the headwinds"" Gene Munster managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures said adding he expected Tesla to continue outperforming other automakers in sales growth.

Toyota and GM Hyundai Motor on Friday reported lower first-quarter U.S. sales than a year earlier.

Musk said in October that Shanghai had surpassed its Fremont California factory - the company's first plant - in output. The two factories are critical for Tesla's goal to boost deliveries by 50% this year as production at its new factories are expected to ramp up slowly in their first year.

Tesla started delivering vehicles made at its factory in Gruenheide Germany in March and deliveries of cars made at its plant in Austin Texas were to begin in the near future.

Story continues

The company's stock soared after Tesla this week revealed plans to seek investor approval to increase its number of shares to enable a stock split. Tesla shares have risen about 3% so far this year while GM and Ford shares have declined.

POLITIQUE - “Ces gens osent tout c’est même à ça qu’on les reconnaît”. Pour tacler Emmanuel Macron Philippe Poutou s’inspire d’Audiard. Alors qu’a eu lieu ce samedi 2 avril le grand meeting du président-candidat à la Paris Défense Arena le candidat du Nouveau Parti Anti-capitaliste pour la présidentielle l’accuse de lui avoir volé son slogan.

Alors qu’il s’adressait à son électorat de gauche Emmanuel Macron a évoqué la situation dans les Ehpad. Rappelant le scandale des mauvais traitements infligés dans des établissements spécialisés du pays le candidat LREM a clamé: “Nos vies leurs vies valent plus que leurs profits”. Il a ensuite enchaîné en assurant que “l’État ne fera pas d’économie sur le dos des plus précaires alors que pendant ce temps d’autres fraudent”.

Une sortie qui n’est pas passée inaperçue notamment auprès de Philippe Poutou qui a dénoncé cette reprise de son slogan de campagne ”Nos vies valent plus que leurs profits”.

“Pendant que ses copains les riches volent l’argent public Macron nous vole nos slogans. Décidément ces gens osent tout c’est même à ça qu’on les reconnaît” a-t-il tweeté reprenant à sa sauce une réplique du film Les tontons flingueurs de Michel Audiard.

Ce slogan a été prononcé pour la première fois par Olivier Besancenot (NPA) lors de la campagne présidentielle de 2002.

Né au bord de la Bouengudi il y a cinq décennies le PDG a eu droit à une célébration pour le moins fastueuse de son 54e anniversaire samedi à Koula-Moutou. Pour l’occasion la capitale provinciale de l’Ogooué-Lolo a rassemblé ses cadres et militants parmi lesquels le président de l’Assemblée nationale Faustin Boukoubi et plusieurs autres élus dont Blaise Louembé qui a tenu à mobiliser le maximum de ce monde pour cette célébration en différé au cours de laquelle a été abordé le sujet commun au sein du parti : la présidentielle prévue dans un peu plus d’un an.

En effet du député du 1er arrondissement de Koula-Moutou au doyen Martin Fidel Magnaga en passant par Huguette Tsono secrétaire nationale chargée de l’animation politique dans la province les cadres du parti au pouvoir ont tous désigné leur candidat pour ce scrutin. Sans surprise et à l’instar d’autres militants à travers le pays ils ont appelé Ali Bongo à se porter candidat à sa propre succession lors de la prochaine élection présidentielle.

Pour ce faire de Fougamou à Koula-Moutou en passant par Lastourville Pana et Iboundji les militants de l’Ogooué-Lolo ont assuré de leur soutien l’actuel président de la République dont ils sont convaincus qu’il fera encore mieux que ce qu’il a déjà fait depuis 2009. Au cas où il accepterait leur appel à se présenter en 2023 ils lui promettent déjà leur «fidélité sans partage»."

The reality star 43 graced the 2024 Met staircase in yet another head-turning ensemble. Putting her signature spin on the theme of “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” Kardashian appeared in a sheer Margiela by John Galliano dress with a lace train featuring leaves and floral accents.

Though her icy bleach-blonde hair perfectly accented the silver in her dress she played down the rest of the look by wearing natural waves and subtle makeup including a shimmery silver eyeshadow. She also bundled up with a simple gray shawl.

Of course the most eye-catching part of her ensemble was her silver corset giving her a drastically tiny waist. At one point Kardashian appeared to get help from attendees to make her way up the steps as a result of the constraining dress.

This year’s Met Gala theme ties into the upcoming Costume Institute exhibit that will feature approximately 250 items — including 15 significant pieces such as an 1877 Charles Frederick Worth silk satin ball gown — that span more than 400 years of history.



Kardashian has a history of making headlines at the Met Gala. She made her debut in 2013 while pregnant with her first child North West and walked the red carpet in a custom Givenchy by Riccardo Tisci dress created out of floral printed jersey along with perfectly matched gloves and shoes. She attended the Gala as a plus-one to her then-boyfriend Kanye West who wore a simple suit by Givenchy by Riccardo Tisci.

The look sparked an influx of memes some of which compared the dress’s material to a couch. In her 2019 installment of Vogue’s ""Life in Looks"" video series Kardashian admitted that she was upset by the internet's response to her look.



“I was crying the whole way home because I just couldn’t believe it” she said.

In 2014 Kardashian went for a more traditional Old Hollywood-inspired look. Alongside West in a black tux she wore a blue strapless Lanvin gown with a black waistband and thigh-high slit.

The fashion mogul channeled Cher at the 2015 Gala in a sheer crystal-embroidered Roberto Cavalli gown with feather detailing.

In 2016 Kardashian and West wore coordinating silver ensembles inspired by the theme Manus x Machina. The star went for a metallic Balmain look which she described as ""blingy sexy robot.""

The Skims founder kept things pared down for the 2017 Met Gala where she wore a simple in an off-the-shoulder Vivienne Westwood Couture corset dress. She also notably went jewelry-free. Months prior to the event she was the victim of a robbery in Paris and later told Ellen DeGeneres she didn't know if she could wear real jewelry again.

In 2018 Kardashian glittered in a gold chainmail dress by Versace featuring embroidered crosses leaning into the theme of “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.”



She accessorized with double cross necklaces and amped up the drama with extra-long hair and smokey eye makeup.

In 2019 Kardashian made a splash in a custom Thierry Mugler dress that was created to convey the designer's vision of her as ""this California girl stepping out of the ocean wet dripping."" The outfit also featured a dramatic corset which she later admitted made it hard for her to breathe.

""I have never felt pain like that in my life"" she told the WSJ Magazine for a digital cover story in July 2019.

At the 2021 Met Gala Kardashian shocked spectators by wearing a black Balenciaga look that covered up her entire body. The custom ensemble featured a long-sleeve turtleneck bodysuit worn under an oversize T-shirt dress with long pleated train. She accessorized with jersey boots jersey gloves and a mask that covered her face — but she still wore a full face of makeup beneath it.

Perhaps her most controversial Met Gala look yet Kardashian appeared at the 2022 event in a dress previously worn by Marilyn Monroe — the very same one that the movie star wore in 1962 to serenade President John F. Kennedy with a sultry rendition of “Happy Birthday.”

The star faced backlash both for the extreme diet she underwent to fit into the dress (she revealed she lost 16 lbs. in three weeks) and for wearing a historically significant gown. There were later allegations that the dress was damaged after she wore it though Ripley's Believe It or Not! which owned the dress and lent it to Kardashian denied this.

The star took glam to another level at the 2023 Met Gala where she wore a custom Schiaparelli haute couture design featuring a draped skirt and top made from more than 50000 freshwater pearls and 16000 crystal pearls. The gown took one-dozen artisans 1000 hours to craft.

The look was an homage to Karl Lagerfeld the late designer that was honored at the 2023 Gala. ""I wanted pearls” Kardashian told Vogue. “I thought 'What is more Karl?' You know the iconic Chanel pearls is what I always thought of. So we wanted to just be dripping in pearls.""

Then a grim discovery is found at the gunman’s home,"CNN —

An armed man gave no warning as he walked toward the front of Jesus’ Dwelling Place Church in Pennsylvania on Sunday raised a gun toward the pastor’s face and pulled the trigger.

What happened next may have been divine intervention Pastor Glenn Germany said.

“I’m thankful to God that I’m still here because he definitely pulled the trigger” Germany told CNN affiliate WTAE.

The gunman “attempted to shoot but the firearm failed to discharge” Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement.

The incident in North Braddock was captured on the church’s livestreamed video. Immediately after the gunman pulled the trigger a church member tackled the suspect to the ground.

State police identified the suspect as 26-year-old Bernard Junior Polite.

It’s not clear why the suspect tried to shoot the pastor. Germany said he had never seen the gunman before Sunday WTAE reported.

“All of a sudden I just seen a gun pointing right at me” the pastor told the affiliate. “And at that point all I could do was run for cover.”

As Germany ran and hid behind a lectern the church’s cameraman rushed the gunman and tackled him to the ground according to WTAE. The pastor quickly emerged from behind the lectern and helped subdue the suspect.

Polite faces charges of attempted criminal homicide aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person court records show.

He was arraigned early Monday morning and was denied bail. He is being held at Allegheny County Jail and his preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 13.

It was not immediately clear if Polite has an attorney.

After the attempted shooting at the church police found the body of a man who was shot in Polite’s home Allegheny County police told CNN. The homicide victim was identified as 56-year-old Derek Polite a relative of the suspect from the church incident.

“County Police can confirm Bernard Polite a suspect in a previous incident Sunday morning at a North Braddock church is known to live at the residence where the shooting occurred and is a relative of the shooting victim” police spokesperson Jim Madalinsky told CNN in an email.

“At this point no charges have been filed in connection with the homicide and it remains an active investigation.”

His attacker is now suing the venue but not the comic. (Evan Agostini / Invision / Associated Press)

The man who tackled comedian Dave Chappelle onstage two years ago has sued the Hollywood Bowl and its security team alleging negligent security and battery.

Isaiah Lee who pleaded no contest to charges relating to the 2022 incident and was sentenced to jail because of it alleged in a civil lawsuit that security guards employed at the venue for the ""Dave Chappelle and Friends"" event pulled Lee off of Chappelle and began beating him ruthlessly spitting on him and dislocating his arm intentionally.

In a complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday — exactly two years after the incident — the 25-year-old who identifies as bisexual and has experienced homelessness said he tackled Chappelle after ""The Dreamer"" star ""unleashed a barrage of homophobic and transphobic jokes"" and joked about homelessness during the inaugural Netflix Is a Joke comedy festival. The complaint obtained Monday by The Times said Lee ""became upset by the discriminatory nature of the comedian's jokes and rushed the stage in protest as the show ended.""

""Instead of intervening to protect Lee [the defendants] allowed members of the comedian's entourage encouraged by the comedian to beat Lee"" the lawsuit said. The complaint also said that a knife fell out of Lee's pocket well after the altercation was underway and that its presence ""did not justify the force"" used against him.

Jonathan D. Evans Lee's attorney argued that the Hollywood Bowl and the unidentified ""Doe"" security companies were aware of Chappelle's history of making offensive jokes that target the LGBTQ+ community as well as his ""propensity for making discriminatory remarks"" but ""took no measures to prevent or mitigate the potential harm caused by such offensive material."" The firebrand comic who is not listed as a defendant in Lee's lawsuit made headlines for months ahead of the incident because of jokes he made in his 2021 Netflix special ""The Closer"" which resulted in an employee walkout for the streaming giant and broad criticism of Chappelle's work.

""We cannot comment on ongoing legal matters"" a spokesperson for the Hollywood Bowl said Monday in a statement to The Times. ""However the safety and security of our audience and artists are of the utmost importance to the Hollywood Bowl. Security procedures are updated regularly to provide the safest possible environment for those who attend and perform at the Bowl.”

A spokesperson for Chappelle did not immediately respond Monday to The Times' request for comment.

Any company the Bowl might contract with for security could not be contacted for comment due to lack of identification.

Lee's attack occurred only months after Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock on live television at the 94th Academy Awards and violence reaching onstage was one of many issues concerning live performers at the time.

According to previous reporting Lee emerged from the Bowl audience on May 3 2022 and appeared to lower his head and charge Chappelle knocking the Emmy-winning actor backward. Lee then fled to the back of the stage where he was apprehended by security and sustained minor injuries. Chappelle who was not hurt later made quips about Lee and the incident and how the events played out.

Lee pleaded no contest to one charge of misdemeanor battery and one charge of entering a restricted area during a live event and was sentenced in December 2022 to nearly nine months in county jail. He completed his sentence and is currently in a transitional living facility his attorney confirmed Monday to The Times.

In the lawsuit Evans argued that the security company employed by the Bowl ""had a duty to exercise due care"" in the performance of its security services and failed to reasonably perform them resulting in the injuries suffered by Lee.

Instead of detaining or arresting Lee using a reasonable amount of force or intervening to protect him from the beating the security company ""allowed members of the comedian's entourage encouraged by the comedian to beat Lee senselessly"" the complaint said. Employees of the security company ""joined in the beating"" and ""took no action to prevent it the assault"" the document said.

""As a direct and proximate result of the above-mentioned conduct of and omissions by Defendants ... [Lee] was placed in great fear for his physical well being and has suffered and continues to suffer extreme mental and physical pain suffering anguish fright nervousness anxiety grief shock humiliation indignity embarrassment and apprehension all to his damage in a sum to be determined at trial"" the complaint said.

The filing also said that Lee ""was placed in great fear for his physical well being suffered and continues to suffer extreme mental and physical pain anxiety humiliation and apprehension among other issues. He has since experienced a significant loss of enjoyment of life and his injuries required immediate surgery it said and he cannot fully use his shoulder or engage in certain physical activities that he regularly did before the incident.

Lee is seeking a judgment against the defendants in a jury trial as well an unspecified amount in damages coverage of his medical and related expenses legal fees and further relief the suit said.

""He’s not after a set dollar amount. He just wants the security company or whoever else was beating him twisting his arm out of socket and spitting on him to answer for going overboard"" Evans said Monday in an email to The Times. ""He should have been detained and taken into custody. That’s it. What the security guards did to him and allowed others to do him goes beyond the scope of what’s acceptable.""

Why didn’t I know I could get breast cancer at 23?”

If she hadn’t known that she could have breast cancer so young there was a very good chance others were equally uninformed she said in a 2021 interview with The Guardian. She spent the next 15 years educating young people about early detection through her nonprofit organization CoppaFeel and in a 2021 memoir “Glittering a Turd.”

On Monday CoppaFeel announced that Ms. Hallenga had died at 38. A spokesman for the organization said she had died at home in Cornwall England and that the cause was breast cancer.

“Survival was never enough” she said during a publicity tour in 2021. “I don’t just want to survive I want to be able to really look at my life and go ‘I’m glad to still be here and I’m getting the most of what I want from life.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25mbC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzQwMDk2MTYzL2pvZS1idXJyb3ctYmFjay10aHJvd2luZy1iZW5nYWxzLXdvcmtvdXRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Burrow back to throwing at Bengals workouts,"Mina Kimes breaks down her thoughts on Joe Burrow and the Bengals offense after Burrow was seen throwing for the first time since surgery. (1:09)

Open Extended Reactions

CINCINNATI -- Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow marked a major offseason milestone on Monday.

As the team started the second phase of voluntary workouts Burrow was in uniform and throwing a pass in a video shared by the team.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday. But quarterbacks coach Brad Kragthorpe told the team's website he was pleased with how Burrow looked in his first practice back since suffering a season-ending wrist surgery last November.

""He looked like the Joe Burrow we're used to seeing"" Kragthorpe said. ""I didn't see any difference. I thought the ball came out of his hand well. Confidently. I'm happy where he's at.""

HE IS SO BACK. pic.twitter.com/ZsZjzkZEmg — Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) May 6 2024

On Nov. 27 Dr. Thomas Graham repaired the scapholunate ligament in Burrow's right wrist a source confirmed to ESPN following an initial report by the Cincinnati Enquirer. In March Burrow told ESPN that he expected to be fully cleared following his surgery. He noted that the timetable for his return if he remained on track was no different than other offseasons.

""In a normal offseason I wouldn't be throwing until OTAs really anyway"" Burrow said. ""I can lift basically normal now which I'm excited about.""

Burrow missed the final seven games of last season after he suffered the wrist injury in a Week 11 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. It capped an injury-riddled year that started with a strained right calf that he suffered during the first week of training camp in 2023 and re-aggravated in Week 2.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday as they started Phase 2 of their offseason program. During this three-week period coaches are allowed to work with players on the field and teams are allowed to run plays at a walk-through pace under certain conditions. No contact is permitted."

The competition heats built gradually for Matt Field (USA) in the Drift Cave / Falken Tire C6 Corvette. In the Rockstar Energy Drink Top 32 opponent Mike Power (USA) broke on the first run while Jonathan Hurst (USA) was damaged and never made it to the Top 16 heats giving Field a bye run. Field then beat Dylan Hughes (USA) in an intense Top 8 battle before he was bumped into the wall by Fredric Aasbo (Norway) in the Quarter Final

With Aasbo too close to Field during the transition into Outside Zone 2 their bumpers touched knocking Field into the concrete walls. The spin damaged all four corners and with Aasbo at fault Field was permitted 10min plus a 5min Competition Timeout to effect repairs. If Field repaired the car the Quarter Final against Aasbo could continue. Since Field was unable to fix the Vette Aasbo was eliminated for causing the accident and Field advanced to the Final. But since the Vette couldn’t compete Field had to settle for second

With no third-place competition Aurimas Bakchis (Lithuania) finished third in the Falken Tire / Feal Suspension Nissan S15 by virtue of his superior qualifying position (fourth) compared to Aasbo (seventh)

Top Rookie was Daniel Stuke (USA) who reached the Top 16 in his Stuke Racing / MspeK Performance Nissan S14.9 where he lost to Rome Charpentier (USA) driving the Garagistic / Federal Tires / imaginegarage E36 BMW. The pair had an epic battle that went to One More Time on two occasions. Finishing tenth overall it signals a great future for Stuke in the FD PRO Championship

In new policy Hennepin Healthcare tells physicians to choose one job,"Calling it part of an ideological evolution leaders at Hennepin Healthcare say the system will end its contract for medical instruction with Minneapolis police and prohibit its doctors from moonlighting as law enforcement agents.

Interim Chief Medical Officer Dr. Daniel Hoody announced the latter policy in an internal newsletter to staff on March 14 explaining the dual professions of some doctors with police agencies is harming patient trust.

""We are hearing from our community and colleagues that ongoing mistrust especially around the unclear relationship between health care and law enforcement is impacting the ability of some to feel safe seeking care"" Hoody wrote. ""Therefore Hennepin Healthcare has made the decision that physicians will no longer be allowed to be dually employed by Hennepin Healthcare as a medical staff member and by a law enforcement agency.""

In response Dr. Paul Nystrom an emergency physician who works part time for the Plymouth Police Department announced he is being ""terminated"" as of June 5.

""I was recently given an ultimatum to either quit policing or be terminated by [Hennepin Health Services] and I decided not to quit my police job"" Nystrom wrote in a March 21 e-mail to colleagues.

Located in downtown Minneapolis Hennepin and its flagship Level I trauma center HCMC serve some of the most vulnerable and diverse groups of patients in the metro including those who may seek treatment related to a criminal act such as drug abuse or otherwise be suspicious of law enforcement.

The hospital system has for years allowed doctors to work side jobs in policing. Some physicians have combined their expertise into a research niche at a nexus of the two professions such as how police should handle severely agitated patients in 911 calls.

Hennepin Healthcare CEO Jennifer DeCubellis said the policy changes come from a need to draw ""really clear lines"" as to the hospital's fundamental mission.

""We want the community to come into a healing environment to a medical care space and know you've got healers in front of you"" DeCubellis said.

Playing for different teams

Hennepin Healthcare employs more than 800 medical providers and only three work for law enforcement agencies DeCubellis said.

Emergency medicine Dr. Jeffrey Ho serves as a licensed deputy for the Meeker County Sheriff's Office. Dr. Gregg Jones is employed at the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office.

""What we've identified with them as they have a decision to make"" DeCubellis said. ""They can choose employment with the law enforcement agency [or] they can choose employment with us as healers. … And we will support them either way.""

Nystrom's attorney Chris Madel said his client was ""extremely disappointed"" to be leaving his emergency and paramedic colleagues ""but he's certainly not disappointed to be done working under the lack of leadership demonstrated by Hennepin Healthcare's executive team.""

Ho and Jones did not respond to requests for interviews. In a 2019 e-mail Ho told the Star Tribune he saw no conflict between his roles. Both doctors and police strive to save lives he said. ""It is my life's work to develop these areas of intersection for the benefit of public protection.""

This professional dynamic is unusual said Eric Campbell a bioethics professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who was not aware of any other hospital systems where doctors also work as police.

Campbell said the dual allegiance poses a clear conflict of interest in areas of patient privacy and consent. A physician's ties to law enforcement could pose optical or practical barriers to some people seeking care he said citing a patient with an outstanding arrest warrant as an example.

""Police enforce laws"" Campbell said. ""Doctors on the other hand must prioritize the best interest of their patients over other things which sometimes may include the law. So the idea that one can equate doctors and law enforcement officers as being on the same team to quote 'protect things' that's a fallacy.""

Campbell said the conflict goes beyond an individual doctor's ability to manage it comparing the situation to a baseball referee holding financial stake in a team or a doctor performing surgery on their spouse. Hospitals possess an ethical duty not to jeopardize public trust in health care. He said it would be ""shortsighted"" for a medical facility to align with police especially in Minneapolis where skepticism of police is high.

Last month Hennepin County Commissioner and hospital board member Irene Fernando called on Nystrom's firing after he appeared in a Minneapolis police training video for a condition of extreme agitation called ""excited delirium.""

Groups such as the American Medical Association have rejected ""excited delirium"" as an overly vague diagnosis often abused to justify police in-custody deaths. Calling Nystrom a ""rogue"" doctor Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the training contradicted his directive on department training.

Hennepin Healthcare has since released a new version of the training conducted by EMS Chief Medical Officer Nick Simpson that doesn't contain the science of ""excited delirium.""

In 2019 the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed a drug conviction against Guntallwon Brown after finding Minneapolis police violated Brown's constitutional rights in an anal cavity search performed by Nystrom. The officers believed Brown to be hiding drugs in his rectum. They initially took Brown to North Memorial Health but a doctor there declined to perform a forced cavity search. So police took Brown to HCMC where Nystrom sedated Brown and conducted the procedure.

The Star Tribune also reported on Ho's financial ties to Axon Enterprise the manufacturer of the TASER stun gun which included working as an expert witness to defend the popular law enforcement weapon in lawsuits against police or Axon. Axon retained Ho as its contract medical director a job to which he dedicated 32 hours per month at HCMC. In exchange Axon paid the hospital about $140000 per year. The hospital canceled that contract in 2019 after public officials called it an ethical breach.

Why now?

Sam Erickson vice president of the union representing paramedics at Hennepin Healthcare questioned the motives driving the new employment policy.

Hospital leadership has known for years about these relationships and they have ""utilized these physicians to collect tens of thousands of dollars in lucrative contracts with the city of Minneapolis and many others"" he said.

In news releases Hennepin Healthcare has advertised training for certified paramedics to become community service officers in Meeker County citing Ho's employment there. A fellowship for EMS offers ""tactical"" training opportunities in its manual: SWAT exercises with the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office via Dr. Jones ride-alongs with Dr. Ho and running training scenarios with Plymouth SWAT courtesy of Nystrom.

""The recent policy change that has resulted in Dr. Nystrom's termination seems reactionary at best disingenuous at worst"" Erickson said.

He said the union will continue to support doctors providing training to law enforcement adding: ""We don't believe this requires providers to be sworn law enforcement officers.""

DeCubellis said no single event prompted the policy change and the decision was difficult to make.

""We are on our own equity journey"" she said. ""I think as a community we are. As a society — as a nation — we are. And part of that involves us as a health system being more in tune than ever before to the community.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

I doubt; I fear; I think strange things which I dare not confess to my own soul.” Bram Stoker author of Dracula

Bram Stoker was born on November 8 1847 on the northside of DublinIreland. The park adjacent to the house where he was born is known as Bram Stoker Park.

Stoker suffered an unknown illness until school at the age of seven when he recovered. Of this time He wrote “I was naturally thoughtful and the leisure of long illness gave opportunity for many thoughts which were fruitful according to their kind in later years”

He grew up without further serious illnesses and excelled throughout his education also participated in sport activities while studying at the university. His first paper was on Sensationalism in Fiction and Society.

The Irish writer became interested in the theatre while a student through his friend Dr. Maunsell. While working for the Irish Civil Service he became the theatre critic for the Dublin Evening Mail which was co-owned by Sheridan Le Fanu an author of Gothic.

However Stoker's visit to an English coastal town of Whitby in North Yorkshire in 1890 led to his inspiration for his Gothic masterpiece and that visit was said to be part of the inspiration for Dracula. He began writing novels while working as manager for Irving and secretary and director of London's Lyceum Theatre.

The Dracula’s author visited Cruden Bay regularly for 17 years in the late 19th century. The 16th century castle in Aberdeenshire Scotland known Slains Castle with gothic appearance in a dramatic location and surrounded by jagged cliffs which can be dangerous was an inspiration for Stoker’s most famous novel.

Dracula which was written in 1895 while in residence at the Kilmarnock Arms Hotel owned by James Cruickshank with his wife Florence and son Noel. The hotel still has the visitors’ book containing the Stokers’ signatures which helped trace their visits during the period 1892-1910. Stoker later moved to two different cottages in the village Crooked Lum Cottage owned by Isy

Cay and Hilton Cottage which belonged to the hotel. While at Hilton Stoker had a view from the garden of the imposing Slains Castle seat of the Hays of Erroll. Stoker would sit in there every day and write at a small table with the castle in sight. It is no surprise that he was influenced by it.

It is very possible that the castle provided a visual palette for Bram Stoker when he started writing the book in Cruden Bay. A distinctive room in Slains Castle the octagonal hall may be the source for the octagonal room in Dracula

Shortly afterwards he wrote “The Mystery of the Sea” - about a visitor to the village drawn into a supernatural mystery - with his Gothic vampire tale published three years later using Cruden Bay as their setting.

There is a snooping chapter in Dracula where the local fishermen of what implies to be Whitby are speaking in the vernacular but the language they’re using is Scots not of English dialect.“So I think Stoker was very sensitive to the Scots sounds and atmosphere he experienced.”

In his book Dracula Stoker describes: “…a vast ruined castle from whose tall black windows came no ray of light and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky”.

And as the character of Dracula starts to emerge he goes on “...I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss face down with his clock spreading around him like great wings...”

The Slains castle is famous for many reasons fairly because it was a place where celebrities were entertained on numerous occasions in the 19th Century.

However the Kilmarnock Arms hotel still functions to this day; anyone is free to walk-in and experience Stoker’s Cruden Bay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiZXJkZWVubGl2ZS5uZXdzL25ld3MvYWJlcmRlZW4tbmV3cy9pdC1zaG91bGRudC1jb25zdGFudC1iYXR0bGUtYWNjZXNzLTY4OTgwNjPSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmVyZGVlbmxpdmUubmV3cy9uZXdzL2FiZXJkZWVuLW5ld3MvaXQtc2hvdWxkbnQtY29uc3RhbnQtYmF0dGxlLWFjY2Vzcy02ODk4MDYzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aberdeen mum in plea for more help for city's autistic children,"Something went wrong please try again later.

An Aberdeen mum has called for more support for the city's autistic children after telling how her son has been denied help.

32-year-old Fiona Hughes is mum to Alexander 10 who has Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) and ADHD and 7-year-old Cameron.

Originally from West Lothian the family moved to the Granite City with in 2017 and stayed after the parents separated. Single mum Fiona cares for the kids full-time at their home in Sheddocksley.

Today is the final day of Autism Awareness Week an annual campaign to improve understanding of the condition.

Fiona told Aberdeen Live securing a diagnosis for her son was an arduous process.

She said: ""Alexander started to show ASC traits between 12 and 18 months.

""He's never had a language delay but his social interactions are impacted. He's got special interests that just consume him and he likes uniformity.

""When he was about two we joined a parent toddler group and we found that Alexander needed almost constant supervision. He struggled with toys not being played with as they should like cars driving under water or people flying - those things made him frustrated.

""Then at three he started nursery and he was just overwhelmed by how busy the cloakroom was at drop off and pick up and before long he was having autistic meltdowns.

""At that point I approached the health visiting team to request a referral for assessment but we were turned away because he didn't have a speech delay.

""It wasn’t until we moved to Aberdeen and the lack of support started to cause aggressive outbursts that we approached our GP to ask for a referral again.

""From referral to diagnosis the whole process took just under 15 months but it took us 4 years all in to have Alexander’s autism recognised.""

Alexander's lack of 'typical characteristics' associated with autism means his condition often goes unnoticed Fiona added.

""He doesn't have 'classic autism traits' and that's made things more difficult"" she said.

""He's highly intelligent and he excels at maths coding and strategy games like Warhammer and Pokémon.

""He tends to mask his symptoms when he's not at home so there's an assumption that he's capable and we've found the school quite reticent to make adjustments to support him.

""Alexander can get really uncomfortable and overwhelmed in the classroom and it can end with him having meltdowns. That mostly happens at home when he feels safe and he doesn't have to mask his feelings.

""Obviously there are limited resources but my mental health can be massively impacted by the pressure of meeting his needs and trying to help his younger brother navigate being a young carer.""

Alexander's struggles at school have left Fiona with no other option but to turn to the third sector for help.

She explained: ""I basically devote all my energy to accessing all the peer support groups and help around Aberdeen. It takes a huge toll on me as an individual but it also eliminates us from support. It's really frustrating and really disheartening.

""Cameron supports his brother but it goes pretty much unacknowledged and it's been impossible to get help for him as a young carer.

""In this day and age it shouldn't a constant battle to access our kid's rights to education and inclusion.""

""We're only in the position we're in as a family because of the tireless help and encouragement we've had from other parents"" she continued.

""Alexander can get sad and lost and angry but he's also a really loving protective clever creative remarkable boy.

""I wouldn’t change him or his ASC for the world but I'm constantly striving to make the world a more accepting and forgiving place for him to grow up in.""",,,,,,

Contractors working on the demolition project at the Southeast Cement Corporation site in Nanzi District Kaohsiung City appear to have seriously breached regulations and safety standards in the lead up to the accident Kaohsiung Public Works Bureau said today.

According to the demolition plan submitted to the Works Bureau the cement silo was to be demolished in three stages. The plan stated that the contents of the silo would be emptied first the equipment attached to the structure would be removed and then the remaining concrete structure would be demolished top-down using demolition jaws to crush the concrete.

However according to the video evidence and the conclusion of the preliminary investigation carried out by the public works bureau none of the steps outlined in the plan were followed. Instead the contractors used an excavator with an extended boom and a wrecking ball attached to chop at the structure close to the base in a method that was described by Kaohsiung Municipal Public Works Bureau Director Chen Haitong as akin to “cutting down a tree.”

The contractor was ordered to immediately stop work and issued a fine of NT$300000 for violating safety regulations. Further fines of up to NT$770000 may be issued pending investigations in breaches of construction industry regulations. The Environmental Protection Bureau also issued a fine of NT$5 million for causing serious dust pollution.

The accident caused serious disruption to the operation of Taiwan’s High Speed Rail service as the collapse of the silo knocked out a high-voltage power line supplying the HSR between Tainan City and Kaohsiung City.

“It’s almost as though they’ve assumed ownership of the ATMs” said Eugene O’Donnell a John Jay professor and former NYPD officer. “It’s well recognized that an ATM can be a magnet for crime and violence and you can’t think of a worse idea than having people domicile inside of one.”

The Post conducted two late night tours of Midtown banks this week and discovered at least eight instances of vagrants cashing in on lax enforcement.

Matt Roberts president of the 17th Precinct Community Council which covers Midtown East neighborhoods including Murray Hill and Sutton Place said the issue has hit full-blown crisis level.

“The banks have been putting pressure on the police department for some enforcement and my pushback to them is just lock your doors” he said at a meeting Tuesday. “The reality of the situation is [customers] are not going into the banks with any regularity during the overnight hours.”

A confrontation between cops and a homeless man staying in a Citibank on Park Avenue on March 3 ended with the bum biting one officer and punching another in the face cutting the officer’s cheek police reports say.

“Ninety nine percent of the time we’re able to move individuals [without conflict]” commanding officer Aaron Edwards said. “We can’t just go in and lock them up. We have to give them the opportunity to leave as part of the law.

“Both cops are OK and he was arrested.”

Roberts said the assaults could’ve been avoided.

“I don’t like to utilize police resources when we don’t need to when there’s a preventable solution but the banks want to provide round-the-clock service” he told The Post.

A Citibank spokesperson did not comment on the assault of the officers and said the bank has no plans to discontinue 24/7 ATM service.

“We take the safety and security of our clients and employees seriously. When we are alerted to an issue on our property our security teams work quickly with law enforcement to address the issue” a Bank of America rep said in an email.

TD Bank and City National Bank did not respond to requests for comments.

The problem is hardly isolated to Midtown.

Retired police commander Edward Mamet said homeless people take up residence in the Valley National Bank ATM attached to his East Village apartment building.

“What disturbs us is they do their bowel movements out on the street or sometimes in the vestibule. People are afraid to enter when they see them” he told The Post.

He said even if cops try to intervene the problem won’t go away if the District Attorney’s Office doesn’t step up.

“The D.A. in Manhattan [Alvin Bragg] is a jerk. It’s the same situation in Brooklyn with D.A. [Eric] Gonzalez so it’s a serious problem” Mamet said.

One Twitter user posted Wednesday “It’s nice how @BankofAmerica and @TDBank_US are both banks and homeless shelters. There are literally people living inside of the banks on 23rd street in NYC.”

Often homeless people fear being robbed or attacked in the city’s shelters but now with Mayor Eric Adams cracking down on homeless encampments and subway vagrancy their options are shrinking.

“We’re walking past people that are living on cardboard boxes in these makeshift inhumane houses – this is just not right” Adams told reporters Tuesday.

“Many more are going to [stay in vestibules] since Adams broke up the encampments” said former Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa who often sees vagrants in banks near his Upper West Side home. “Only five people went to a shelter. They didn’t just disappear. Bill De Blasio didn’t get it and Adams doesn’t get it.”

“There are viable opportunities to bring our expertise into ATM vestibules as well” she said in an email.

Adding an authorized user to your credit card account can be a great way to meet spending requirements accrue more points and even help a novice build their credit history. While it can be highly beneficial there are also risks associated with adding an authorized user — or even being one yourself.

It's important to choose someone who is responsible and able to repay their debts even if they're not legally obligated to do so. That's just the tip of the iceberg so here is everything you need to know about authorized users.

What is an authorized user?

An authorized user is a person who has been added to a primary credit cardholder's account. Authorized users receive cards with their names on them linked to the primary cardholder's account. They're able to use those cards to make purchases just like they would with their own cards.

Benefits of adding authorized users

Adding authorized users can be beneficial to both the primary cardholder and the authorized user for a few reasons:

The authorized user can help meet spending requirements on the primary cardholder's account.

The authorized user can establish a credit history early on.

But perhaps the best reason to add authorized users is the ability to take advantage of various card benefits for authorized users.

For example you can add up to 10 authorized users for free on the Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard® granting each of them (plus two guests or immediate family members) access to Admirals Club lounges when flying American or its partners.

Meanwhile you can add up to four authorized users for free on the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card extending access to Capital One and Priority Pass lounges for your authorized user and up to two guests.

Additionally having authorized users on your Ultimate Rewards credit card allows you to transfer rewards directly to their loyalty program accounts. This is really great if you have a stash of Ultimate Rewards points you want to transfer to a family member's MileagePlus account. Sharing United miles carries a fee of $7.50 per 500 miles plus a $30 processing fee. But you can transfer Ultimate Rewards points directly into the United MileagePlus account of an authorized user without violating any rules or incurring hefty fees.

While Chase allows household members to transfer Ultimate Rewards points to each other in order to transfer Ultimate Rewards directly into another loyalty account (e.g. United Southwest Hyatt) the other account must be held by an authorized user on your Chase credit card.

The downside of adding authorized users

The downside of adding authorized users is that it may become more difficult to track spending when two people are using the same card. Also the primary cardholder is responsible for all charges to the account. So if your authorized user goes on a spending spree and refuses to cover the charges you'll be on the hook for their purchases.

Making someone an authorized user carries risk. Only add an authorized user you completely trust and be sure to communicate ahead of time about your expectations for repayment.

Who can be an authorized user?

Barring issuer-specific age restrictions anyone can be an authorized user. American Express requires authorized users to be at least 13 years old and have no defaulted accounts with the bank. Discover imposes a minimum age of 15 and U.S. Bank requires authorized users to be at least 16 years old.

Bank of America Capital One Chase Citi and Wells Fargo do not impose age restrictions.

Can I remove an authorized user?

Removing an authorized user is as simple as calling your credit card issuer. Some banks including Citi even let you do it online. Once the user has been removed from the account which is typically done in a matter of minutes the credit card becomes inactive.

However it may take several weeks for the card to no longer be listed as an active account on your authorized user's credit report.

Get the most benefit for adding an authorized user

Some credit cards will provide incentives for adding authorized users to your account. For example the Virgin Atlantic World Elite Mastercard® currently offers 30000 Flying Club bonus miles after spending $1000 or more in purchases within the first 90 days of account opening.

Additionally you can earn up to 15000 Flying Club bonus miles every anniversary after qualifying purchases and up to 5000 Flying Club bonus miles when you add additional cardholders to your account.

The information for the Virgin Atlantic card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Furthermore if you have a credit card that offers a big spending incentive adding an authorized user is a great way to help you meet that requirement. For example spending on your Southwest credit cards counts toward the coveted Companion Pass. Earning 125000 points per year is a little easier when you have a big-spending (and responsible) authorized user to help you get there.

Another way to benefit from having an authorized user on your card is with the The Platinum Card® from American Express. The card carries a flat $195 fee to add each authorized user (see rates and fees). However this includes key benefits like lounge access complimentary Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors Gold elite status and more.

Note that you can add up to five authorized users to the American Express® Gold Card for free (see rates and fees). These authorized users can then earn Membership Rewards points at the same rate as the primary cardholder: 4 points per dollar at restaurants and 4 points per dollar at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25000 in purchases per calendar year then 1 point per dollar).

This is a great way for household members to get many of the best benefits of two rewarding cards.

How do authorized users affect my credit — and their own?

Adding an authorized user will not impact your credit unless the additional card racks up a large amount of spending and increases your credit utilization ratio. This can be avoided by paying off large balances before the statement closing date.

Meanwhile authorized users can see a positive credit impact by having access to an additional credit line and lowering their own credit utilization ratios. For those building a credit history being an authorized user can be a huge boost.

When I was in high school my sister added me as an authorized user on her Bank of America credit card. By the time my 18th birthday rolled around I had a two-year credit history and got approved for the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express. It worked out well for me and because I didn't use the card for crazy spending sprees my sister's credit wasn't negatively impacted.

It takes responsible people on both sides to mitigate possible negative impacts of adding an authorized user.

Should you open a joint account or add an authorized user?

The difference between a joint account and an authorized user comes down to liability. Joint account holders share liability for charges while authorized users do not. Primary cardholders can also limit the amount of credit an authorized user can utilize. Joint account holders together can access the full credit line.

Being a joint account holder may prevent you from qualifying for your own version of the same card in the future. For example my mom was added as a joint account holder to my dad's Chase Sapphire Preferred Card years ago. When she applied for her own card last year she was denied because Chase viewed her as already having the card. If she had been an authorized user (as opposed to a joint account holder) she would have qualified for her own card.

There isn't much of an upside to joint accounts other than lessening the burden of liability on the primary cardholder. Ideally you shouldn't be adding anyone to your credit card (as an authorized user or joint account holder) unless you trust them to use it responsibly.

Bottom line

Adding an authorized user can be widely beneficial to both parties. However it's important to be aware of the risks as the last thing you want to do is sour a relationship because of one person's financial irresponsibility. Only add an authorized user whom you completely trust to be responsible with your credit line and pay their share of the balance on time.

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.

New York CNN Business —

The US may have the world’s most powerful military but the dollar is its greatest weapon. Now after nearly 80 years of dollar dominance the US might be in danger of losing its global reserve currency status.

About 60% of the $12.8 trillion in global currency reserves are currently held in dollars giving the US an exorbitant privilege over other countries. And that privilege pays: Because US government debt backed by the dollar is very attractive interest rates are lower. The US gets to borrow from other countries in its own currency — so if the US dollar loses value debt does too. American businesses can make international transactions in dollars without having to pay conversion fees.

Perhaps most importantly in extreme circumstances the US can cut off dollar access to central banks around the globe isolating and draining their economies. Raghuram Rajan the former governor of the Reserve Bank of India calls this power an “economic weapon of mass destruction.”

The US detonated this weapon on Russia in February after the country invaded Ukraine freezing $630 billion worth of forex reserves and deeply undermining the value of the ruble. That gave America the ability to punish Russia without getting US troops involved in war.

But with great power comes great responsibility: When you use a weapon of mass destruction even an economic one people get spooked. To protect themselves from the same fate as Russia other countries diversify their investments away from the US dollar into other currencies.

That’s where the country’s reserve currency status could run into problems.

Weaponizing the dollar said Bank of America strategists’ Michael Hartnett could lead to its debasement. The “balkanization of global financial systems” erodes America’s role as the reserve currency he added.

A new research paper by the International Monetary Fund found that the dollar share of international reserves have been in decline for the past two decades around the same time the United States began its war on terror and its counter-terror sanctions. One quarter of reserves have since shifted from the dollar to Chinese yuan and the other three quarters have moved into currencies of smaller countries.

“These observations provide hints of how the international system may evolve going forward” warned the paper’s co-authors Serkan Arslanalp of the IMF Barry Eichengreen of the University of California Berkeley and Chima Simpson-Bell also of the IMF.

Russia and China are also hoping to guide the evolution of the international system.

Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened on Thursday to end gas exports to countries that do not open an account with a Russian bank and pay in rubles. The European Union gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia with no easy alternatives.

Saudi Arabia meanwhile is in talks with Beijing to accept yuan instead of dollars for Chinese oil sales.

So is king dollar about to be dethroned?

If the past two years have taught us anything it’s that nothing is impossible. But the prospect of the US losing that exorbitant privilege is very unlikely.

For one thing the alternatives aren’t great. China has been pushing the yuan for years and only about 3% of global transactions are conducted in the currency that’s compared to 40% for the dollar.

The US is also still fairly attractive to the rest of the globe. The US equity market is the largest and most liquid stock market in the world and foreign capital is flowing into the country. Global foreign-direct investment flows grew by 77% to an estimated $1.65 trillion in 2021 but the investment in the US soared by 114% to $323 billion according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

Goodbye Q1 hello Q2!

The second quarter may not be fun but at least we’ll be prepared for it.

The seesaw first quarter of 2022 came to a bitter end this week with major stock indices printing their worst performance in two years. Surging inflation Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a speed-up of the Federal Reserve’s rate-increase plan created a series of unique challenges for investors.

Those challenges will continue into the second quarter. But often the devil you know is better than the devil you don’t.

We asked analysts what they predict will be the largest headwinds going into this quarter and how they’re preparing for them. Here’s what we found.

Geopolitical unrest: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has stunned markets across the globe. The geopolitical unrest has rippled through energy markets commodities and even to food insecurity issues.

Josh Leonardi director of prime services at TD Securities is looking to commodities markets where raw products are sold to hedge against the Russian conflict. He likes wheat in particular. About a quarter of the world’s wheat supply comes from Russia and Ukraine. Future contracts for the crop are through the roof as supply becomes scarce but demand remains the same.

It’s probably best not to bet on oil and energy since those commodities have been particularly volatile and reactive to news updates.

Inflation: The US is currently battling an inflation problem the likes of which it hasn’t seen in 40 years so it’s time to look to real assets as a hedge on inflation said Leonardi. That means investing in commodities real estate land equipment and natural resources.

Interest in real estate investment is exploding he said. “I don’t know if anything is hotter on the market right now. You have everything from single- and multi-family homes to data centers to cold storage facilities.”

When investing in markets look to companies that make money off of inflationary spikes. Banks earn more as interest rates rise and they profit from wider spreads. Companies with low capital needs are also good bets.

Rate hikes: The Federal Reserve is probably going to be aggressive in raising interest rates going forward said Liz Anne Sonders managing director and chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.

Typically investors believe in a safety guard known as “The Fed put.” It’s the notion that enough market weakness will cause the Fed to stop raising interest rates and tighten policy and perhaps even reverse and ease rates. Because inflation is so out of hand there’s no way that’s going to happen this time around said Sonders.

“Investors need to be aware of that especially if they’re being more aggressive because they think the Fed won’t let markets down” said Sonders. They’ll continue to raise rates and will do it to slow economic growth. That means the risk of recession is higher than it otherwise would be.

Farmer Joe was enticed to take a bath with Claire both of whom developed a connection with each other during their first 24-hour date together.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle.

The cattle and sheep farmer 33 offered another 24-hour date up for grabs with the marketing manager 36 pulling out all the stops to win.

'I saw the bathtub near our tent so yeah I just wanted to set up a little spot for us to share some time together' Claire told producers.

Farmer Wants A Wife Australia fans said they were left 'cringing' away from the TV on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants

However it seemed the plan 'fell flat' when awkward scenes showed the pair stripping down and stepping into the warm bath looking shy in front of the cameras.

The pair appeared uncomfortable sharing affections while in their underwear on TV but did attempt to share a kiss and caress one another in a cringey display.

'I couldn't watch the bath just a bunch of giggling it was so cringe' one person wrote on Facebook.

Another added: 'I know I felt awkward for watching haha not even a conversation going.'

'Yes it was so cringeworthy it was hard to watch' one user commented.

Others noted that it was only awkward because Farmer Joe did not appear to be as interested in Claire as she was him.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle

One wrote: 'To me that date thing that Claire planned for Joe fell flat I honestly don't think he's feeling it for any of the women.'

'No he is not feeling it with any of them but well and truly enjoying the game!' another agreed.

If your mother enjoys the outdoors and appreciates the delicate beauty of birds what better gift is there than a bird bath? More specifically a solar-powered bird bath fountain. It only needs a little bit of sun exposure before it begins blasting water into the air giving all of your flying friends a chance to wash off that sky dust.

(For even more ideas check out our roundups of the best Mother's Day gifts for every budget and the best last-minute Mother's Day gifts to shop now.)

Why is this a good deal? 💰

At over 30% off this matches the best price we've seen this year. It's also one of the most affordable options on all of Amazon with most other fountains starting at $17 and going up from there.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Running water makes for an attractive feature in any space and this fountain pump will spray water high into the air using nothing but solar power. You don't need to plug it in anywhere; just place it in the bird bath and after about three seconds it will begin spraying water. It doesn't store energy so it may be somewhat less effective on cloudy days.

There are also six different nozzles that you can swap out for different water patterns so you can mix things up from time to time. If you keep it in the middle of a properly-sized bird bath you won't lose a lot of water over the sides. It will minimize the amount of refilling you have to do. That said you should clean it every so often to prevent the pump lines from clogging — the company suggests doing so at least once a week.

Splish splash they were takin' a bath! Mom will enjoy the feathered fun this bird bath will bring to her garden. (Amazon)

What reviewers say 💬

With over 7900 five-star reviews a lot of fans have added this touch of whimsy to their birdbath.

Pros 👍

Despite concerns over sun exposure fans say this fountain works well even with indirect light. ""I have a bird bath with a shallow basin and only 1/2 day of direct sunlight. My concern was that I did not want to have stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes. This solar fountain pump works great. It even works at lower capacity using only reflected light when the bird bath is in a shadowy part of the day.""

Another bird-watcher said ""This little thing is beautiful. It aerates the water and the birds love it.""

It isn't limited just to bird baths either. ""I bought it for my neighbor's koi pond but he put it in his pool. It sprays water about 3 feet in the air. He loves it.""

Cons 👎

One fan said it can be a little noisy. ""I love them! I have one in my front and back garden. Only downside is they make a sputtering noise when they’re not in full sun.""

Another shopper warned that it might actually be too powerful. ""I found that they have too much power for my small birdbath. I put a half-inch square of electrical tape over one of the solar collectors and wait and watch. If the spray is too strong I put another piece on. it usually takes three pieces.""

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”"

The move will enhance east Brainerd by putting life back into the former Pamida turned Ascensus office space near the Mill Avenue and Highway 210 intersection. The site is southeast of the East Brainerd Mall.

The new location will primarily be collision repair and mechanical repairs with the latest state-of-the-art equipment for that and for mechanical work with the advanced driver assistance systems and work on calibrations. The move will free up space in the existing location 13540 Ironwood Drive to accommodate items there just wasn’t room for such as boats and recreational vehicles. Shannon’s has just outgrown its current space. With the expansion the business will increase from 16000 square feet to an additional 40000 square feet for 2.5 times the space.

Shannon’s plans to hire about 25 people for the expansion doubling its employee count. And with the tight labor force Shannon’s is also being proactive by doing in-house training cross-training and providing apprentice training. The apprentices are then trained for Shannon’s operations and with advanced and specialized skills. The apprentice program takes individuals with the basics and schooling and pairs with a tech with years of training as they expand their knowledge. Manufacturers also help with the training.

Shannon Christian started Shannon’s Auto Body in 1996 and grew the business into a 17000 square foot facility with about 25 employees utilizing the latest auto repair technology and are committed to repairing your vehicle safely and correctly to its pre-collision condition.

The days of simple repair and just putting on a new bumper are nearly a by-gone era as vehicles become more technologically advanced. A lot of the product and equipment Shannon’s Auto Body needs comes from Europe with the pandemic and now the war in Ukraine what took six weeks to get now takes six months. Containers of equipment that once cost $4500 are now $19000 for a container.

Given the time it takes to plan for the new facility and then get things like garage doors for example with the supply shortages the new facility is expected to be ready by early 2023.

Multiple sources stated a QuikTrip the convenience store noted for its expansive offerings along with its gas station was anticipated to open on the site and would likely have been a nice draw for that side of the city but the uncertainty in Brainerd with the Minnesota Department of Transportation favoring a roundabout at Mill and Highway 210 instead of the desired signal light intersection there in east Brainerd cooled the interest in the property.

Shannon’s has been working on the plans since their offer was accepted in December. Since then it’s been designing the shop traveling to other operations around the country to see how they do it and moving forward with the expansion plans.

Look for more details in the future as the work continues.

Kaizer Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter has underlined the importance of their upcoming Premier Soccer League games.

Chiefs are fighting for a Caf Champions League spot for next season and are still within a chance to attain that.

Article continues below

Saturday’s 3-1 victory away at Chippa United kept them in the run for a top-two finish as they are third on the table with two points behind second-placed Royal AM.

“I think the game [against Chippa] fell into two categories. It was a tough game mentally for the players because it’s one of those games where we knew that if we don't get anything but a win then we are not serious about the rest of the term” said Baxter as per IOL.

“Now we can go into the rest of the season hunting. So it was an important win for us. But every game will be the same it will be a Cup final. When you go one in front and score a second goal it’s also a mental kick in between the legs. “

And to come back from that I think that was ‘well done lads’. I was happy with the tactical and technical part for the 70 minutes of the 90. I think we had a period in the first half and early in the second half where we didn’t commit enough.”

Chiefs are left with nine league games to play this season and their nearest rivals Royal AM have played two more matches than them.

If PSL prosecutor Zola Majavu does not overturn in his review independent arbitrator Nazeer Cassim’s decision to have Chiefs play outstanding games against Cape Town City and Golden Arrows Amakhosi will have an advantage in their top-two quest.

Up next for Amakhosi is hosting TS Gallaxy on Tuesday before welcoming SuperSport United on April 16.

Aaliyah Laianah and Trey had their whole lives ahead of them.

Each one of them could light up the room.

The eldest Aaliyah 6 ""so articulate and bright"" was reading ahead of her year at school and told stories to her younger siblings. She was ""physically fit and strong"" always trying to copy her mother's CrossFit routines. In her grandmother's words: ""A good kid. A strong child.""

Four-year-old Laianah – ""Little Middle"" or ""Gracie Girl"" – was the craziest of the trio. She did things to make the others laugh playing the role of the little dynamo in the hectic family life.

Trey 3 was the apple of his mother's eye and ""very much a mummy's boy"". Sweet but sporty he knew how to kick and pass a football at only 3. He had the makings of a sports star.

Then there was their mum – Hannah Clarke – ""bright bubbly and full of empathy"". She embodied selflessness but still had a competitive edge in the gym. Her soul touched the lives of everyone she knew and her smile was infectious. In their beaming bubbly photos they were the perfect portrait of family life.

But on February 19 2020 their lives ended in an instant.

The horrific deaths of Hannah Clarke and Aaliyah Laianah and Trey shocked Australia. Photo / Supplied

The four had just left her parents' Camp Hill home when Hannah's ex-husband Rowan Baxter furious at his wife's newfound love of life and happiness did the ultimate unthinkable act.

Armed with a knife and jerry can full of fuel he ambushed the mum of three and forced his way into the car.

Baxter demanded Hannah drive as she screamed for him to get out of the car.

In a heroic final act to protect her children she defied her violent ex's threat pulling the car up to a driveway in Durimbil St after it travelled some 200m down the road.

""Call the police call the police he's trying to kill me he's poured petrol on me"" she cried to Michael Zemek as he was washing his car.

Suddenly the car exploded.

Windows across the street rattled from the blast. Hannah and Baxter were consumed by the flames as neighbours desperately attempted to hose down the screaming mother. A thick plume of black smoke could be seen across the neighbourhood.

Aaliyah Laianah and Trey – who were strapped in the car's back seat – perished in the flames.

Covered head to toe in severe burns Hannah recounted as much as she could to emergency services who raced to the scene.

Tragically she died in hospital hours later.

Baxter looking deadpan and resigned retrieved the knife from the burning wreck and took his own life as others attempted to extinguish the fire.

The murder of Hannah and her children scarred the nation. It led to an outpouring of grief at the loss of the young mum thrusting Australia's domestic violence scourge onto the international stage. Tributes were made memorials were held and politicians bowed their heads and acknowledged the horror of what had unfolded in their nation's streets.

The lives of Sue and Lloyd Clarke – Hannah's devastated parents – were shattered at the loss of their daughter and grandchildren.

Now two years on a coronial inquest is shining a light on what led to the tragedy.

The trauma was already well known so it needed to start by looking backwards: what warning signs if any were missed?

What contact did Hannah have with support services before the killing?

What changes should be made to stop another horrific act just like this from occurring?

Over two weeks the court would slowly piece together many things that were hiding in plain sight.

An abusive unhappy marriage.

A disturbing portrait of Baxter's manipulative and controlling behaviours towards Hannah and even the kids.

The fleeting moments the four could have been protected and the powerlessness of authorities to do so.

Red flags in a broken marriage

The moment Sue Clarke laid her eyes on Rowan Baxter she didn't like him.

Baxter carrying the swagger of an ex-footballer and packing a stocky muscled build he was 11 years older than their 20-year-old daughter. He was still living with his former partner - which he said was ""purely for his child"" - when Hannah introduced him to her parents.

At the time no one knew Baxter had contemplated killing his ex-partner and his son in a murder-suicide having told an old friend he'd driven to the woman's house armed with a rope tape and a knife.

Despite their reservations Baxter won the Clarkes over. Sue described him as being ""lovely"" for the first few years of the marriage.

But when the children arrived their relationship soured.

""I don't know whether he was putting on a good front and it was getting too hard to keep putting up the facade or the stress of opening the gym but in all honesty I don't know"" Sue told the inquest.

Hannah and Baxter ran their business Integr8 & CrossFit SMC in Mansfield. Sue said she invested money into the gym to help get the pair on their feet – something she said may have caused Baxter to feel like he was ""owned"" by the Clarkes.

Whatever the case Baxter treated his mother-in-law ""terribly"".

Apart from berating other paying customers in the gym as fat and lazy he told Sue she never needed to be there. During one exercise while supporting Sue Baxter dropped her causing her to split her face open. He then laughed at her much to the open shock of other members of the gym and her own husband.

""He told me to harden up that it happens all the time when you played football"" Sue said.

When Hannah ""misbehaved"" in Baxter's eyes he would punish Sue by not allowing her to mind the children. If Sue spoke out she would get teary calls from her daughter begging her to apologise to Baxter. After Hannah went back to work Baxter schemed to try to interfere with Sue's contact with the children planning days off from his job so she wouldn't be able to mind them.

Being around Baxter was like walking on eggshells.

""I could never say what I thought"" Sue said.

As the inquest progressed a disturbing portrait of the New Zealand-born Baxter and his seemingly idyllic marriage to Hannah emerged.

Baxter would demand sex from Hannah every day at times choking her during the act. Hannah's friends said she wasn't allowed to wear shorts or the colour pink on Baxter's orders. He alone decided who she could and couldn't see.

Even during training sessions Baxter would become jealous and angry if his wife performed better than him and attempt to undermine her achievements by accusing her of cheating or not doing routines properly.

Kylie Buss gave evidence that Baxter would call Hannah ""fat"" behind closed doors berating her body image while saying she ""needed to lose weight"" and get back in shape.

Aaliyah Laianah and Trey fared no better. They were only ""possessions"" in Baxter's eyes and he was unusually rough with each of them.

Nicole Brooks Hannah's childhood friend recalled one incident where Baxter knocked Aaliyah into a doorframe while the pair were playfighting. The impact split the young girl's head open.

She told the inquest another time he decided the children would take part in a post-workout ice bath with him. A screaming Trey his eyes bulging with fear was nearly submerged in the freezing water. They hated every minute of it.

Bizarrely Baxter would film some of these experiences and post them to his business' Facebook page.

And even though Aaliyah feared her father immensely she often stood up to him.

Sue told the court Baxter would storm out during fights with Hannah where the youngster would slam the door behind him and defiantly shout: ""And don't come back!""

If he sulked and refused to speak to Hannah Aaliyah would admonish him saying: ""Daddy Mummy said sorry can't you talk to her?""

Sue said ""He disliked her out of his three children because she was strong and would stand up.""

But in a chilling indicator of things to come Sue said her daughter asked her if she needed a will.

""I said everybody should have a will"" she told the court.

""I said 'why?' and [Hannah] said 'When he kills me he'll be in jail and what happens to the children?' ""

A week later Baxter would murder Hannah and her kids.

Finding her feet

By late 2019 Hannah and Baxter had separated.

She had sought help from support services and the police slowly gaining an understanding that Baxter's behaviour fit the definition of coercive control.

Distinct from physical kinds of domestic violence it is the kind of abuse where controlling behaviours are exerted to shift the balance of power in relationships.

Senior Constable Kirsten Kent was one of the police officers who helped Hannah in the aftermath of her relationship.

Nothing jumped out in her interview at Carindale Police Station at first. Then there was the alarming disclosure of Baxter forcing Hannah to have sex every night.

""She said it was another chore she had to do"" Kent told the inquest.

Despite the admission there was not enough evidence to make an application for a domestic violence order (DVO) at the time. But Hannah wasn't keen on pursuing it at the time either.

""We still need evidence and all that I had was what Hannah told me"" Kent said.

""I would have needed Hannah to at least give me an affidavit for me to proceed with an application.""

Days later Kent saw Hannah working at The Athlete's Foot store in Carindale. She noted the young mum looked ""so fearful"".

A DVO wasn't made until Baxter made a choice to abscond with Laianah on Boxing Day 2019.

That day he scooped up the young child in his arms in front of a distraught Hannah and her other two children striding over to his car and speeding off.

He fled to northern NSW returning Laianah to her mother days later.

Police body cameras were played to the inquest capturing Hannah's distressed conversations with officers who were called by a concerned bystander.

Senior Constable Luke Erba – one of the officers who attended that day – gave evidence he and his partner discussed what to do while at the scene.

But because there were no orders in place no charges could be laid.

""Being the biological father he does have a right to the child and we can't just unfortunately we can't just go and take the child even though he's acting like he did"" Erba said.

Baxter managed to call police with Laianah still in tow.

He complained about his wife and lied about Laianah willingly coming with him and jumping in the car with him that day. He talks almost ironically of Hannah trying to ""recover"" Laianah from his custody.

That same month Hannah had gone to Brisbane's Domestic Violence Service for advice. A support worker said she was classed as ""high risk"" because Baxter choked her during sex.

But the inquest was told that information was not passed on to police.

It was ""assumed"" they knew of the incident and her risk level given the presence of the DVO.

In another disturbing revelation the inquest was told Hannah found a note on Baxter's phone more than a month before she and her children were killed.

It said the children ""will miss you I'm sure"".

""You can't f*** with someone's life like this and expect them to just take it"" the note read.

""I'm not going to take it anymore Hannah.

""Do you know how hard it is to go to bed every night without your children? I wish you had have just tried.

""You destroyed my life and I cannot move on. I hope all this was worth it for you and your family.

""I'm finishing your game. I don't want to play anymore. This was never ever my intention.""

Final acts of an evil killer

Baxter was unravelling.

His viciousness exposed cut off from his picture-perfect relationship and feeling the pressure of the police and courts closing he was becoming more and more gripped by paranoia. He was running out of money having closed the family gym after he and Hannah separated.

And yet he maintained it was never his fault.

In his final moments he plotted the ultimate act of evil one that would erase Hannah's presence from the very earth. His movements were captured on CCTV and receipt trails that spoke to the actions of a man desperate to regain control.

Officers served him with a police protection order (PPN) and DV application after confronting him at his home on December 29 2019.

He still had Laianah on his shoulder just days before having abducted her from Hannah.

In police bodycam footage he bemoans being served the paperwork.

In January a warrant was issued after he assaulted Hannah while dropping the kids off to her home.

Hannah had noticed a number of photographs – depicting her in her underwear – in the back of his car. As she attempted to take the photos Baxter grabbed her and twisted her arm so fiercely it left a large red mark.

Kent told the inquest she believed Baxter would use the pictures as a defence against his ex-wife's claim in court.

""He was trying to use the pictures to say: 'Look my wife is sending me these pictures she obviously wants to have sex with me'"" she said.

Officers were also unaware Baxter had a criminal history in New Zealand attacking a cyclist in a road rage incident.

Former friends and associates of the killer had already seen that things were spiralling out of control.

Eoin Coffey said Baxter had bragged to him about leaving a ""tape recording device"" – an old iPad – in the Clarkes' family home after briefly visiting the children.

The device picked up Hannah talking to her mother about Baxter. During the conversation they degrade him as among other names a narcissist.

Church pastor Christopher Ensbey recalled Baxter tearfully confiding to him when his marriage was breaking down.

Days before the killing clad in a black singlet and shorts he paced the aisles of Bunnings Warehouse looking at items such as motor fuel.

At the checkout he emerges with a jerry can zip-ties and surface cleaner.

A receipt from a Caltex service station dated February 18 2020 revealed he filled that jerry can with 4.6 litres of fuel.

But two other purchases stood out: three Kinder Surprise chocolates and other lollies from the store.

Dr Jacoba Brasch QC counsel assisting the coroner said it might have been part of a plan to drive away only kill Hannah with the fuel and zip-ties then give his children the sweets and pretend they were a ""happy family"".

One of his last acts on February 18 was to phone a men's helpline. In the call he tells the operator he wants to go on a 10-week behavioural change programme.

But he doesn't disclose his history or his treatment of Hannah or the kids. Instead he spends part of his final moments complaining about losing his family and blames his ex-wife for his predicament.

""It's not my idea but apparently I have to do it"" he jokes.

He tells the operator Hannah had ""got to the stage where she was dictating"" when he could have the children. He lies again about the Boxing Day abduction saying Laianah wanted to come with him in defiance of her mother. He says his wife put a DVO on him and things got ""worse and worse and worse"".

""So much of my life has been turned around in five minutes it's just scary"" he says.

""I never thought my wife was capable of doing this.""

The operator passes on the numbers of other support services to call. He does so and the call goes unanswered because the operators are busy.

The service which has a 24-hour callback service phoned Baxter back the next day at 12.01pm.

By this time he Hannah Trey Aaliyah and Laianah were dead.

The ultimate question - why?

Sue and Lloyd lost everything on that morning of February 19 2020. They have never gone back to work.

The family home that once rang with the laughter and life of their grandchildren now echoes with silence. The girls' room – still strewn with toys – has remained untouched for more than two years.

But somehow in the face of the tragedy they found strength. Strength to turn up to court each day. Strength to front the cameras and recorders thrust in their faces from the media. Strength to sit through the details of their daughter's most intimate and personal horrors being laid bare by eyewitnesses and old friends.

In many ways their resilience in attending the inquest is the ultimate show of strength.

Sweeping changes have been recommended to how police respond to domestic violence situations. Another included trialling a ""multidisciplinary police station"" that provides support services such as housing and child safety.

A stronger need for men requiring behavioural education and help was also recommended to tackle the lack of services available.

Brasch said more scrutiny also needed to be placed on perpetrators of domestic and family violence.

But even with all the proposals one thing was clear: nothing could have been done to save Hannah on the morning of February 19 2020. Once Baxter put his murderous intent into action nothing could deter him from the path he embarked on. It was but ""a matter of time"" before Hannah was killed.

Two years later the Clarkes have only one question – why?

Brasch said there was a simple answer: because Baxter was ""evil"".

While they continue to lose market shares to SUVs minivans remain practical solutions for North American families. And with some models now available with hybrid technology at a time when gas prices are unbelievably high they might be more relevant than ever.

Winner

Our 2021 Best Buy award winner is still the top choice for 2022. The Toyota Sienna is one year removed from a full redesign which included a standard hybrid powertrain. It burns just 6.7 L/100 km combined a remarkable feat given its size and weight.

Photo: Toyota

Another major asset for the Sienna especially here in Canada is the available AWD system. Add it all up and it makes for a pretty compelling and capable vehicle. Driving isn’t much fun but if you care more about practicality fuel economy and great reliability this Toyota minivan will definitely please you.

Other Finalists

The runner-up for 2022 is Chrysler’s Pacifica-Grand Caravan duo. These models deliver pleasant surefooted handling and fairly decent performance.

Photo: Marc Lachapelle

The Pacifica obviously stands out with an available plug-in hybrid variant giving you the ability to travel about 50 kilometres on pure battery power. Other models can be specified with AWD but only with the gasoline engine. Too bad.

The Grand Caravan is a good minivan as well but the higher price compared to its Dodge predecessor makes it less attractive to families on a budget.

Third place in the segment is occupied by the brand new Kia Carnival.

As a replacement for the Sedona this boldly styled Korean minivan makes a much stronger case in every key area—from handling to fit and finish. It doesn’t offer AWD or a hybrid powertrain however so it stays behind the aforementioned competitors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vMXgtbWVtYmVyc2hpcC1yZXdhcmRzLXBvaW50cy1wZXItZG9sbGFyLWF0LWJlc3RidXktY29tLWVucm9sbG1lbnQtcmVxdWlyZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,(EXPIRED) +1x Membership Rewards points per dollar at BestBuy.com [enrollment required],"Sorry this deal is no longer available.

The Deal

Quick Thoughts

While an extra point per dollar doesn’t move the needle in getting me particularly excited on the earn side it certainly beats one fewer point per dollar spent. If you sync this up strategically on a card where you’re working on a welcome bonus or retention offer or are otherwise earning more than 1x it could be a nice small bonus. On the flip side if you want Amex Platinum card purchase protections but struggle with the idea of getting 1x this could at least help you get reasonable return on send while maintaining those purchase protections.

Keep in mind also that the Amex Business Platinum card earns 1.5x at Best Buy so syncing up this offer on that card could net you 2.5x total.

All that said keep in mind that the PointCard debit card has consistently offered 5x (worth 5% back) at Best Buy on up to $1K in purchases per period (usually about a month long). That’s a much stronger return in my opinion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzAzL3dob2xlLXBheWNoZWNrLW5vLW1vcmUtcmVkZGl0LXVzZXJzLW9uLXRoZS1iZXN0LWJ1ZGdldC1idXlzLWF0LXdob2xlLWZvb2RzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""Whole paycheck"" no more: Reddit users on the best budget buys at Whole Foods","Although the bright green signage of Whole Foods may bring back memories of achingly empty pockets Bezos-sponsored times have changed.

Prices are based on grocery costs in New York City. For this article we compared Safeway's online prices to Whole Foods'.

Oatmeal

Whichever side you stand re: the oatmeal as a delicacy debate those of us who have chosen an oat-filled life usually consume at a high volume. The best prices at WF usually come from the in-house brand 'Whole Foods Market 365' and if you're looking to stock up on quick oats this may be your new jam. A 42-ounce container of Quaker Oats whole grain quick oats typically costs $7.49 at Safeway whereas the 365 counterpart goes for $6.29 and is organic as well.



Beans

You know how in college some people gain a reputation for doing crazy stuff at parties? I was the girl who would sometimes just eat a can of beans (sober) out of laziness and hunger. Vulnerability aside Whole Foods' store-brand selection of organic canned beans is pretty unbeatable. A Safeway 'O' Organics can of black beans runs for $1.69 each while the same thing at Whole Foods is $1.19. That price point stretches across a variety of legumes including garbanzos cannellini and pinto.



Some dried fruits

Once again shouting out oatmeal lovers because you need to dress it up to keep it interesting. Certain kinds of dried fruits can be a good value like pitted and dried prunes. An 8-ounce bag from Sunsweet at Safeway is $4.49 while the same product from the 365 brand is $4.29.

Greek yogurt

It's hard to find an organic greek yogurt at a better price point than the one offered by Whole Foods' store brand. A 32-ounce. container with 3% milkfat is priced at $5.79 while a similar Chobani container that isn't organic is $6.49 at Safeway.

Frozen fruit

I have spoken to the gospel of the smoothie before and I will continue this crusade by sharing some great organic frozen fruit prices to encourage you to join this cult. 365 has a variety of 12-ounce bags like blueberries raspberries pineapple and strawberries all of which are priced lower than Safeway's organic store brand bags which are also only 10-ounce. For some like blueberries the price difference is about a dollar and for others less but for the quality and quantity Whole Foods' option is a better bet.

Blackrock College 50 Gonzaga College 21

A 70th Leinster Schools Senior Cup title and one that will stand favourable comparison with the most memorable that Blackrock College have racked up down through the years. It came on foot of a brilliant performance from an outstanding team who produced a cracking brand of rugby that showcased their power and athleticism to great effect.

The final scoreline might seem a little lopsided especially given the nature of the contest but Gonzaga lost nothing in the manner of their performance in the final. They scored three superb tries could have registered a couple more all the product of some superbly inventive back play. In another year they would have been worthy champions.

However no one can quibble with Blackrock's success one that revolved around the contribution of several outstanding individuals within an impressive team dynamic. The seven tries originated from a primary physical superiority that allowed them to dominate many of the collisions and in this respect Paddy McCarthy the outstanding Liam Molony Kevin Jackson and replacement Jack Molony were especially prominent.

Blackrock did enjoy a smidgeon of good fortune captain Gus McCarthy - he was otherwise excellent - receiving a yellow card for a shoulder charge clearout that didn't look too clever in real time.

Blackrock centre Hugh Cooney embellished a brilliant display with two tries fullback Reuben Moloney another who looks a superb prospect in a backline that contained high-calibre players; a word too for halfbacks Oliver Coffey and Zach Quirke who ran the game beautifully.

Gonzaga were resilient and doughty in trying to withstand the physical battering and in that respect the pack to a man stood up manfully. George Morris Luke O'Callaghan Noah Maguire and number eight Paul Wilson put body and soul into carrying and tackling.

Michael Sullivan was a sharp and lively presence at scrumhalf Jody Browne's ability to beat or break a tackle was a significant asset while in fullback Hugo McLaughlin Gonzaga possessed a gem that glistened in an attacking capacity.

The underdogs had the temerity to score the first try of the match on eight minutes. It came off a turnover and Gonzaga were precise and accurate in creating an overlap that enabled Rory Finlay to scamper over unopposed. McLaughlin kicked a superb touchline conversion.

Blackrock's response was unequivocal Liam Molony drove over from close range Cooney chose a lovely line to cut the Gonzaga defence open and Eddie Walsh was set free by Reuben Moloney for an unopposed run to the line; the genesis of all three tries coming from Blackrock's power in contact.

When Gus McCarthy received his seven-minute sabbatical in the sin bin Gonzaga dominated the ball. Sullivan might have had a try if McLaughlin’s pass had been a bit more sympathetic the scrumhalf again threatened after a fine Browne break before McLaughlin availed of some good work by the forwards to cross for a try which he converted. It was a rip-roaring contest.

Blackrock were ruthless in improving on their 21-14 interval lead starting two minutes after the restart with a brilliant strike move from a lineout which Andrew Quinn finished with a flourish. Quirke converted and tagged on a penalty kick to make it 31-21.

Gonzaga managed one final riposte and it was a doozy from centre Hugh Goddard's soft hands and disguise in the pass to Hugo Neville cracking line and timing onto the ball. McLaughlin converted and at 31-21 the next score was crucial.

It materialised two minutes later and belonged to Blackrock; Cooney charged down Stephen McMahon’s attempted clearance and regathered sharply before the ball vanished from the in-goal area.

It proved a tipping point as Blackrock signed off on the victory in impressive style Gus McCarthy adding a sixth try before his replacement Mikey Yarr claimed a seventh tail gunner in yet another Blackrock lineout maul that beat a relentless path to the Gonzaga line. It was the fitting epitaph for a superb final to which both schools contributed lavishly.

The power pace and panache with which Blackrock captured their 70th Leinster Schools Senior Cup confirmed it as a special band of brothers at The RDS.

The fact they were able to reach the 50-point barrier with Conor O’Shaughnessy’s conversion of Mikey Yarr’s injury-time try is a measure of their quality.

For Gonzaga could have been recognised as worthy winners in many other years were it not their misfortune to come up against a machine that rolled out seven tries against three.

The boys in green even had the benefit of a superb opening try Jody Browne and Hugo McLaughlin playing Rory Finlay in up the left for McLaughlin to convert.

The manner in which ‘Rock moved into overdrive was certainly impressive their heavies taking over for Liam Molony to ground the maul from close range Hugh Cooney sweeping through on a wonderful line and Ruben Moloney slipping the ball for Eoghan Walsh to score at his ease Zach Quirke converting all three for 21-7 in the 18th minute.

The game could have been turned on its’ head when Blackrock captain Gus McCarthy was shown a yellow card that could easily have been another for a shoulder charge.

Gonzaga had the nous to turn the extra man into seven points from McLaughlin’s finish an conversion for 21-14 at the break.

There were no signs of the high-octane pace dropping Gonzaga resisting consecutive breaks by Paddy McCarthy and Oliver Coffey together with sustained pressure led by Brigg to force a knock-on near the line.

Just when ‘Zaga looked like getting out of jail wing Andrew Quinn worked his magic from a beautifully designed move off a lineout.

Quirke added the conversion and the out-half was content to take a penalty from the next surge.

There was still enough opportunity for Gonzaga to construct a stunning try from a scrum Hugh Goddard’s sleight of hand sending Hugo Neville to heaven for McLaughlin to convert.

Blackrock had had enough by this stage Cooney making a block and a pick for a try in the left corner.

They opted to manage their way to the end from there putting their big boys on the ball to test Gonzaga’s endless reserves of character.

Simple game management meant a maul was manoeuvred for captain McCarthy to claim the sixth try Quirke converting for 43-21 in the 65th minute.

It was left to the menace of the maul to do its’ work again with replacement Mikey Yarr in the van as it steamrolled to the line for Conor O’Shaughnessy to land the conversion.

Daire Walsh reports from the RDS

BLACKROCK COLLEGE OVERCAME a shaky start at the RDS this afternoon to claim their 70th Leinster Schools Senior Cup title in devastating style at the expense of Gonzaga College.

Searching for a maiden crown at this grade Gonzaga raced into an early lead courtesy of a well-worked try from Rory Finlay. This briefly raised the prospect of a major upset from Declan Fassbender’s side but ‘Rock had other ideas.

A haul of seven tries over the course of the action – including a brace by outside centre Hugh Cooney – ensured they cruised their way home.

Playing in just their second final at this level – their previous appearance in 2019 ended in a 28-5 defeat to St Michael’s College – Gonzaga displayed the initial attacking intent and deservedly broke the deadlock with just under five minutes on the clock.

After the ball was spread out wide towards the left flank Jody Browne and Hugo McLaughlin combined before the latter released winger Finlay for a run over the whitewash. McLaughlin superbly dissected uprights off the resulting bonus strike to make it a dream opening for the Ranelagh men.

Their seven-point lead didn’t last long however as ‘Rock blindside flanker Liam Molony dotted down under a slew of bodies for a 10th-minute score that was supplemented by a Zach Quirke conversion.

Having shaken off some early cobwebs the Williamstown school were expected to push on from here and take charge of the contest. This is precisely what happened as the play moved into the second-quarter.

Cooney grabbed their second try (and his first) of the game at the end of a multi-phased move and just three minutes later Justin Vanstone’s charges were in again when full-back Ruben Moloney released Eoghan Walsh for an impressive five-point finish on the left-wing.

Yet the sin-binning of captain Gus McCarthy forced ‘Rock on the back-foot for an extended spell and a re-energised Gonzaga pounced in his absence. After much persistence close to the opposition line McLaughlin dived over to the left of the posts for a try that he converted himself.

This reduced Blackrock’s lead to seven points (21-14) at the interval and consequently presented Gonzaga with a fighting chance on the resumption.

However ‘Rock had been restored to their full compliment in the closing minutes of the opening period and were determined to reassert themselves in the second period. Diligent defence from Gonzaga briefly kept them at bay but when Andrew Quinn capitalised on some loose play deep inside enemy territory he confidently burst over for ‘Rock’s fourth try of the proceedings.

After he once again supplied the extras on top of this effort Quirke contributed his fifth successful kick of the day from a 47th-minute penalty.

Although the signs were becoming increasingly ominous for Gonzaga – the alma mater of Ulster scrum-half John Cooney – right-wing Hugo Neville burst through a gap in the ‘Rock defence to record a magnificent solo try on the stroke of 50 minutes.

This offered the vocal ‘Zaga faithful a glimmer of hope but Blackrock immediately fired back with a second try from Cooney after he charged Stephen McMahon’s attempted clearance and touched down just before it drifted out of bounds.

While this effectively placed the outcome beyond doubt hooker Gus McCarthy and his replacement Mikey Yarr (introduced for the second time in the game) both added tries in the dying minutes to leave all of 29 points between the teams in the end.

Blackrock College 50 Gonzaga College 21

Blackrock College claimed their 70th Leinster Schools Senior Cup title with a dominant victory over Gonzaga College at the RDS earlier this afternoon.

Despite falling behind to an early Gonzaga try from Rory Finlay ‘Rock stormed into the contest with subsequent five-pointers of their own courtesy of Liam Molony Hugh Cooney and Eoghan Walsh.

Hugo McLaughlin’s converted score reduced the Gonzaga deficit to seven points (21-14) at the interval but 10 unanswered points on the resumption helped ‘Rock to reassert their authority.

A superb solo try by Hugo Neville offered Gonzaga a glimmer of hope in their search for a maiden senior cup crown but final-quarter efforts from Cooney captain Gus McCarthy and Mikey Yarr ensured Blackrock cruised home in style.

I was covering the Kellogg’s strike in Omaha Nebraska for TRNN at the time when I received a Twitter DM from one of the workers at Sabre alerting me to the sudden walkout. Stagnant wages dwindling employee benefits and lack of COVID hazard pay were among workers’ chief concerns when the walkout occurred.

Five months later the workers are in the midst of a contentious union election that has pitted them against volatile management and a team of union-busting consultants called in from out of state to discourage workers from voting “Yes.” Ballots for the union election were mailed out to workers on March 14 and are due back by Monday April 4. The official counting of ballots will be conducted on April 5.

This is the third time that workers have attempted to organize a union at Sabre Industries in Sioux City in recent years. The last attempt took place in 2018 when workers reached out to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) with the intent of filing a petition for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) but they were unable to guarantee enough signatures by rank-and-file workers to cross the threshold that would have triggered an NLRB-conducted election. (As the NLRB website states “If at least 30% of workers sign cards or a petition saying they want a union the NLRB will conduct an election.”) Another union election that took place in 2016 at a plant in Hicksville Ohio was ultimately unsuccessful. This time however workers at the Iowa plant furnished enough signatures to bring an election to the plant and filed their petition with the NLRB in early February.

[Sabre Industries] workers [in Sioux City] are in the midst of a contentious union election that has pitted them against volatile management and a team of union-busting consultants called in from out of state to discourage workers from voting “Yes.” Ballots for the union election were mailed out to workers on March 14 and are due back by Monday April 4. The official counting of ballots will be conducted on April 5.

Sabre Industries is one of the largest manufacturers of steel structures used for telecommunications in the US. The Sioux City plant which employs about 500 workers is currently undergoing a $25 million expansion that would bring an estimated 76 new jobs. Additionally Sioux City City Council and the state of Iowa furnished millions of dollars in TIF and state financing in order to complete the project. The expansion which is nearing completion includes a large metal galvanizing facility that would dramatically increase the plant’s manufacturing capacities.

In April 2021 the company was acquired by Blackstone Group Inc. an alternative investment management company based in New York City that as stated on its website invests “across the alternative asset classes in private equity real estate credit and hedge funds as well as in infrastructure life sciences insurance and growth equity.” In Blackstone’s financial reports for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Stephen A. Schwarzman stated “Blackstone’s fourth quarter results represented a remarkable finish to a record-breaking year. Our limited partners entrusted us with $270 billion of inflows in 2021 with assets under management rising 42% to $881 billion—our fastest growth rate in over a decade.” This time last year Chibuike Oguh reported in Reuters that “Schwarzman pocketed at least $610.5 million in 2020 from dividends and compensation more than any other private equity executive and up 20% from last year despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic regulatory filings showed.”

Blackstone’s acquisition of Sabre Industries came at a time when the Biden administration was ramping up its efforts to push plans for a historic investment in national infrastructure through Congress. Infrastructure is a key area of focus for the private equity arm of Blackstone’s investment management operation though other companies that Blackstone has acquired as part of its Corporate Private Equity portfolio include the dating app Bumble Ancestry.com and SERVPRO.

According to a 2021 report prepared by Samir Sonti of the CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies commissioned and distributed jointly by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund (AFREF) private equity firms utilize a “leveraged buyout” to acquire companies like Sabre Industries. “Central to the private equity business model is the leveraged buyout through which a general partner or private equity manager utilizes a substantial amount of debt—or ‘leverage’—together with investors’ capital to purchase a company” the report states. Sabre Industries has passed from firm to firm over the last ten years with two buyouts from other private equity firms—Kohlberg & Company LLC and The Jordan Company LP respectively—happening in 2012 and 2019.

“The place has been a revolving door for as long as I’ve been there… People leaving new people always coming cycling through and [then] they realize all the crap and they end up leaving. Beau Scott a welder-fitter with three years of tenure at Sabre Industries in Sioux City Iowa

Up until the 2008 financial crisis these types of investments generally brought forward a return that justified the purchases. Such investments however caused a massive problem for the working class. According to the AFT-AFREF report “Worker rights organizations have drawn attention to the ways in which private equity firms have contributed to and profited off bankruptcies that have had devastating impacts on workers and retirees.” There is sadly much ready proof of the destructive force company buyouts by private equity firms can have on workers and consumers. In a 2019 piece for The Nation entitled “This Is a Horror Story: How Private Equity Vampires Are Killing Everything” labor journalist Kim Kelly writes

According to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project more than 11.7 million workers are employed by private equity-owned companies in the United States today. As the firms work to increase the cash flows at the companies they buy “private equity firms have often taken a low road approach and sought to reduce wages benefits and staffing at firms they acquire—with devastating consequences to workers their families and entire communities.” Since Sabre Industries began to be acquired by private equity firms workers at the Iowa plant say they have seen such cost-cutting measures implemented to the detriment of their workforce including the steady erosion of benefits over the last couple of years. As worker-organizer and current Sabre employee Larry O’Dell put it “Sabre just keeps taking stuff away.”

Since Sabre Industries began to be acquired by private equity firms workers at the Iowa plant say they have seen such cost-cutting measures implemented to the detriment of their workforce including the steady erosion of benefits over the last couple of years. As worker-organizer and current Sabre employee Larry O’Dell put it “Sabre just keeps taking stuff away.”

Work at the Sioux City plant is demanding and can be dangerous. Employees report working up to 60-hour weeks 7 days a week with very little time off causing staff turnover as people cycle in and out of the plant. According to Beau Scott a welder-fitter with three years of tenure at the company the rate of staff turnover is a burden on workers and the company but it’s not a surprise. “The place has been a revolving door for as long as I’ve been there” Scott said. “People leaving new people always coming cycling through and [then] they realize all the crap and they end up leaving. There’s a select few leads and managers that drive people away. It’s hard to get that sense of community going. There’s people that have been there for years and years longer than me but even me—I’ve only been there for three years and I’m already technically a veteran compared to everyone else there.” This is one of the reasons Scott believes a unionized workforce would be beneficial for everyone and go a long way to repairing the company’s reputation among past and potential employees: “people would actually want to come work for Sabre.”

In the last 5 years the Iowa-based manufacturing plant has been subject to multiple OSHA accident investigations. Two accidents at the Iowa plant which occurred in March and April of 2019 resulted in workers being hospitalized with traumatic injuries and the company paying out paltry fines as a result. “Considering what we do” Scott said “of course we’re underpaid.”

BRINGING IN THE UNION BUSTERS

Not long after the workers began to work with IBEW organizers on a union drive the company brought in consultants from the Labor Relations Institute (LRI) a known union-busting (“union avoidance”) firm to begin a series of captive-audience “informational meetings” at the plant. On their website LRI boasts over 40 years of helping clients “earn protect and retain their direct relationship privilege” touting a record of “10000+ union elections won” by which they mean elections that swung in favor of their anti-union clients.

LRI’s website also hosts a number of free whitepapers for businesses looking to prevent unionization and thwart efforts by workers to organize including one 2010 whitepaper titled “Left of Boom: Best Practices for Proactive Companies in a Changing Labor Environment” which is listed under a dropdown menu titled “What Can Your Business Learn from the Iraq War?” In “Left of Boom” LRI President and General Counsel Phillip Wilson paints a picture of US soldiers being ambushed by improvised explosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan prompting a tumultuous scene wherein soldiers “spill out in a desperate effort to try to catch the renegade insurgent who triggered the road-side bomb” while scrambling to deal with the damage caused by the explosion. The ultimate conclusion of Wilson’s labored—and pretty damn revealing—analogy is that just like military operatives must have a preemptive offensive strategy for thwarting terrorist bombers and preventing deadly explosions from happening in the first place businesses looking to squash workers’ efforts to unionize need to well you get it.

LRI’s website also hosts a number of free whitepapers for businesses looking to prevent unionization and thwart efforts by workers to organize including one 2010 whitepaper titled “Left of Boom: Best Practices for Proactive Companies in a Changing Labor Environment” which is listed under a dropdown menu titled “What Can Your Business Learn from the Iraq War?”

Granted Wilson does admit that “One can take the comparison between negative employment events or union organizing and insurgent networks too far… Nevertheless from a strategic standpoint there are similarities in the underlying strategies of a guerilla insurgency and a union organizing campaign. There is much to be learned from effective military strategies to develop business strategies to respond to attacks by outside ‘forces.’”

According to documents obtained by The Real News Sabre Industries requested that LRI “provide a subject matter expert to educate and prepare [their] employees for union organizing activity.” The original Statement of Work dated October 25 2021 has since been replaced with a “verbal agreement” between the company and independent contractors brought in by LRI to the tune of $200 per hour plus expenses. A Jan. 2022 LM-20 Agreement and Activities Report filed with the Office of Labor-Management Standards documents the enlistment of one of the private consultants—Gus Flores President of GNE Consulting Services Inc.—“To persuade employees to exercise or not to exercise or persuade employees as to the manner of exercising the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing.”

The meetings designed “to educate and prepare employees for union organizing activity” which took place every week leading up to the election featured the typical rhetoric employed by union-busting firms to dissuade workers from voting in favor of unionization. In an audio recording of one such meeting obtained by TRNN Flores claimed to only be interested in presenting “the facts” to workers about what bringing a union into the plant would mean. Like consultants employed to host similar meetings at companies like Amazon Flores stressed the importance of workers maintaining a “direct relationship” with management instead of having to mediate worker-manager relations through the union which is described as an outside party (a “whole separate organization and entity”). O’Dell found these homages to direct relationships between workers and management to be particularly ironic: “They talk about direct management relationships” he said “but we already don’t have a relationship with HR.”

“Unions are the epitome of democracy you know? It’s [the] power of the people power in numbers. If these big companies were really looking out for our best interests why are they wasting so much time and money trying to stop us from doing this?” Beau Scott a welder-fitter with three years of tenure at Sabre Industries in Sioux City Iowa

For Scott the reasoning for such tactics is clear. “Unions are the epitome of democracy you know? It’s [the] power of the people power in numbers” he said. “If these big companies were really looking out for our best interests why are they wasting so much time and money trying to stop us from doing this?”

Despite the evident anti-union bias presented in the meetings some workers continued to push back. In recordings of the captive audience meetings provided to TRNN multiple workers spoke in favor of the union. At one point during a meeting in December 2021 one worker spoke up in response to a statement about management’s willingness to listen saying

Sabre Industries Employee: “They say they listen but they don’t listen worth a shit. If they listened why is it that 52 people clocked off one day and went on strike? Because we’ve all told them everything multiple times over the years and it just seems to go in one ear and out the other. So why did it come to that point if they say they listen?” Gus Flores: “… I can’t I can’t answer that…”

At another point in the same meeting O’Dell raised a number of issues to Flores most notably the participation of workers in the collective bargaining process should the election be successful.

Larry O’Dell: “So you brought up that you wouldn’t be able to negotiate your wages with your employer and whatnot… but that’s the whole thing with the union: the employees are part of the union. And also you negotiate these things while you negotiate the contract so you wouldn’t have to go to the employer to talk about these things because it’s already in a contract planned out beforehand.” Gus Flores: “If the company agrees.” LO: “Well yeah of course. It’s a negotiation.” … LO: “If we group together and we use our leverage you would think–” GF: “You would think…” LO: “That we’d have a little bit more power because the company’s not making money if we’re not producing.” GF: “On the contrary in my opinion you would lose power because you put your faith into a whole separate organization and entity—” LO: “Well it’s not a separate organization because it’s us.” GF: “Okay well we can argue until the cows come home–” LO: [Scoffs.]

Apparently O’Dell’s commonsense questions were not appreciated by Flores or his clients—he was eventually barred from attending any additional meetings conducted by management and the outside consultants from LRI.

While high-profile union elections—and stunning union victories—at companies like Amazon and Starbucks have captured national attention critical struggles like the one taking place in Sioux City have gone sorely underreported. For workers at Sabre Industries however the upcoming union election could have dramatic implications for their lives and their jobs.

Should the election break in favor of unionization workers like O’Dell are hoping for a strong contract that includes a Cost of Living Adjustment which would guarantee wage increases that keep pace with the rising cost of living within Sioux City better overtime rates for workers who work more than 40 hours per week and security in their insurance and retirement benefits.

In addition to the material benefits that a collective bargaining agreement could provide Scott stressed his want to foster more of a brotherhood at the plant. “I just want us workers to have more of a sense of community” Scott said. “We as a species made it this far by [building] community and working together and that should spill over into the workforce.”

When I asked about the general feeling among workers in the plant O’Dell remained positive despite the attempts by management to dissuade workers from voting “Yes.” “Most of the people I talk to are on board. I haven’t been able to talk to everyone but the mood is generally positive” he said. “I’m still hopeful that we’re going to win.”

Air France operates several different Boeing 777-300ER interior configurations but this flight was operated by the airline’s most premium-heavy aircraft featuring four seats in the La Prémiere-branded first class section and a whopping 58 business class seats.

While Delta’s digital messaging before flying out of New York was strong and mostly helpful that was not the case with this Air France flight booked on a Delta codeshare. Delta prompted me to upload proof of a negative COVID-19 test as required to enter the United States but that data was never communicated on the backend to Air France and Delta’s own app was functionally useless for this trip forcing me to download the Air France app. Because of this snafu I was unable to fully checkin or retrieve my connecting flight’s boarding pass.

I was however able to dig up a link to Air France’s version of the document check portal. But even though I provided my test information nearly 24 hours before my flight I didn’t receive a confirmation until I was on the jet bridge of my originating flight. Not helpful at all. I expected better for two very closely integrated airlines.

Boarding in Paris’ beautiful and expansive terminal 2E K pier was relatively calm and orderly. Thankfully we were held short of the jet bridge as it was easily over 100 degrees Fahrenheit due to the stunning all-glass construction and bright sunny day.

My business class seat the popular Cirrus product made by Safran Seats was located in the forward mini-cabin with just four rows of seats in a 1-2-1 configuration.

I found a thick pillow and blanket along with a hanger waiting for me on my seat with a small bottle of water tucked next to the AC and USB power outlets.

I was soon greeted by the lead flight attendant and handed a small amenity kit and a sealed envelope containing a face mask and a few sanitization items.

We also received the all-important pre-departure beverage.

After a succinct but attention grabbing safety video we were on our way to New York.

I took a few minutes to browse Air France’s entertainment selection and found plenty of content I wanted to watch on the large screen. The selection wasn’t as fully featured as on Delta’s A330neo but it was more than sufficient.

The carrier provided noise canceling headphones. Sadly the headphones were pretty weak providing minimal cancellation effect and a somewhat tinny sound. Air France ensures that a secondary headphone jack is accessible so that passengers can plug in their own set which is what I did.

There were a few instances where only one or two movies in a larger series were available but overall the selection was better than average. I preferred to navigate through the IFE system on the big touchscreen rather than the smaller touchscreen remote control.

The remote mostly just mirrored what was on the larger screen but it did offer quick access to playback controls and could run the moving map independently which is a great feature.

Wi-Fi was also available via what is understood to be Intelsat 2Ku (formerly Gogo). Pricing ranged from a free messaging plan up to full flight streaming connectivity for EUR 30. The free messaging service was a bit sluggish but was reliable for the entire flight.

Unlike my earlier Delta flight the pre-ordering of meals was not facilitated. A full menu was distributed. While the menu was several pages long it only provided general information about meals and drinks and lacked sufficient details.

For example my chicken dish was only noted as coming with pan-fried apples but it was actually served on a small bed of pasta and asparagus. The drink menu suffered the same lack of detail listing only “gin” “vodka” and “bitter” without actually specifying the brands.

The main meal was served as a properly plated multi-course meal something that has been eliminated by many airlines throughout the pandemic.

All of the courses were quite good with the chicken dish being the best juiciest chicken I have probably ever consumed in the sky.

The only change I would make would be to have the pre-arrival zucchini and cheese tart warmed up before serving.

As this was a daytime flight I didn’t attempt to get any sleep but Air France’s reverse herringbone seat provided a larger footwell than Delta’s A330neo suite.

With that said the Air France seat lacked the fine movement control that Delta’s seat offers; controls for the latter change the level of recline and forward position of the seat.

The seat had plenty of flat surface area and a little storage area to hold my various travel items.

If I were to book this trip again I would probably do so in reverse opting for the roomier Air France seat on the overnight flight and Delta’s suite on the daytime return for the added movies on offer.

I was not left wanting on Air France though and overall the experience was among the best I have had in business class in recent years.

Over 500 people have been killed in the last five years in fatal air accidents across the world involving the “Next Generation” Boeing aircraft bringing the world’s largest manufacturer of aircraft under the serious scrutiny of global aviation watchdogs.

The recent air crash involving the Boeing 737-800 the “Next Generation” aircraft operated by China Eastern Airlines that left 132 passengers and crew on board dead has brought all such 737-800 aircraft operated by different airlines in India under heightened scrutiny by India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

Chinese aviation officials have recovered the two flight recorders or black boxes of the ill-fated Chinese aircraft that crashed on 21 March and are in the process of decoding it to understand the reason for the crash. The first black box of the Boeing 737 aircraft believed to be the cockpit voice recorder was recovered on 23 March while the second was found on 26 March. The 737-800 that was carrying the passengers of flight number MU5735 operated by China Eastern Airlines is one of the Chicago-based aviation company’s safest models when one considers flight-to-crash ratio.

It is totally different from the 737 Max that was at the centre of a major safety related controversy that erupted three years ago in March 2019 when all 387 Max aircraft were grounded following two fatal crashes that were blamed on a fault in the 737 Max’s autopilot software. The software forced the planes into unintended nosedives.

India has 75 Boeing 737-800 aircraft in operation with the largest fleet of this aircraft being used by low-cost carrier SpiceJet. SpiceJet has 36 Boeing 737-800 “Next Generation” aircraft in operation while Vistara has about 14 such aircraft in operation in India. Air India’s low-cost carrier Air India Express has 25 Boeing 737-800 aircrafts in operation. Between 2010 and 2022 two Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by Air India Express had crashed in India killing 170 passengers and crew on board. The latest incident involving the Boeing 737-800 in India was in 2020 when an Air India Express flight from Dubai to Kozhikode overshot the runway during landing and fell into a gorge killing 20 people on board including the pilot and co-pilot and leaving several others injured.

In 2020 alone Boeing’s 737-800 reported four accidents globally which led to hull loss (damage to the aircraft beyond repair). Out of these four accidents involving this aircraft of Boeing two were being operated by Pegasus airlines a low-cost carrier of Turkey and one each by Swift Air of Spain and Air India Express from India according to Boeing’s “Statistical summary of commercial Jet Airplane accident” report released in 2021.

In 2021 no fatal accident or any accident termed to be “substantial” was reported involving the Boeing Next Generation aircraft. It is pertinent to mention that a major part of 2021 witnessed a shutdown/lockdown across the globe due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Boeing 737-800 is a narrow-bodied aircraft that can seat 189 passengers in a single-class configuration and 162 passengers in a two-class configuration. It was first launched in September 1994 and is a stretched version of the 737-700. This variant of Boeing’s “Next Generation” aircraft can fly a maximum distance of 5600 km with a typical cruise speed of 840 km/hr. The world over Boeing has 117 airlines using their 737 series with over 7283 deliveries completed by the company for this variant of the aircraft. This variant is mostly used by low-cost carriers as it provides fuel economy and more passenger seats.

According to Boeing’s own accident report the company’s Next Gen 737 series which includes the 737-600/700/800/900 has reported 21 major accidents since the aircraft’s launch in 1994. Between 2006 and 2021 Boeing’s second most advanced narrow body aircraft the Boeing 737-800 has met with 11 accidents killing 787 people and leaving 271 severely injured.

The Boeing’s 737 Max which is an advanced version of 737-800 and a part of Boeing’s 737 family was launched with much pomp and show by the aircraft manufacturer terming it as the most advanced aircraft both aesthetically as well as technologically. But soon the 737 Max started reporting technical problems. The aircraft was involved in two successive crashes that killed 346 passengers within a span of six months. On 29 October 2018 the Indonesian carrier Lion Air flight 610 crashed. Less than six months later Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed on 10 March 2019 soon after taking off. After this all 387 Max aircraft in service across 59 airlines worldwide were grounded and investigation was launched into the aircraft with Boeing being put to question over “faulty design”. Later Boeing was charged with “fraud” for hiding information from safety regulators. In January 2021 Boeing entered into an agreement with the American Department of Justice (DoJ) to resolve the criminal charge related to a “conspiracy to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration’s Aircraft Evaluation Group (FAA AEG) in connection with the FAA AEG’s evaluation of Boeing’s 737 MAX airplane”.

Under the terms set by the DoJ Boeing was asked to pay a total criminal monetary amount of over $2.5 billion that composed of a criminal monetary penalty of $243.6 million compensation payments to Boeing’s 737 MAX airline customers of $1.77 billion and the establishment of a $500 million crash-victim beneficiaries fund to compensate the heirs relatives and legal beneficiaries of the 346 passengers who died in the Boeing 737 MAX crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. “The misleading statements half-truths and omissions communicated by Boeing employees to the FAA impeded the government’s ability to ensure the safety of the flying public” the statement by DoJ said.

Indian airline SpiceJet currently operates 13 Boeing 737 Max aircraft and according to Boeing the company has an order book of 214 Boeing 737 Max from India’s SpiceJet and its newest client Akasa Air. The Boeing 737 Max grounded in March 2019 was allowed to take to the skies once again by the DGCA through an order dated 26 August 2021 after Boeing had made the necessary changes in its design and the US aviation watchdog Federal Aviation Administration issuing an Airworthiness Directive certificate in November 2020.

This was followed by Boeing’s 737 Max receiving airworthiness certificate from the European Aviation Safety Agency in February 2021. In total over 17 regulators have permitted the operation of Boeing 737 Max as of August 2021.

The Sunday Guardian sent a detailed questionnaire to Boeing seeking details on safety regulation for Boeing’s 737-800 aircraft the steps that the manufacturer has taken for ensuring that the aircraft is safe to operate and whether the company has done any audit to unravel reason/reasons for the multiple air crashes and whether Indian air carriers using these models of Boeing have been re-briefed.

In response to The Sunday Guardian’s questionnaire Boeing said “We extend our deepest condolences for the loss of those on board China Eastern Airlines Flight MU 5735. Our thoughts and prayers are with the passengers and crew their families and all those affected by this accident. Boeing will continue to support our airline customers during this difficult time. In addition a Boeing technical team is supporting the NTSB and the Civil Aviation Administration of China who will lead the investigation.”

Here’s a breakup of the accidents involving deaths of passengers:

1. September 2018-Air Niugini Flight 73 – under shot the runway and landed in a lagoon-1 killed Boeing 737-800; 2. 29 October 2018-Lion Air Flight 610 – Nosedived and crashed 11 minutes after taking off-189 people killed Boeing 737 Max; 3. 10 March 2019-Ethiopian Airlines-Flight 302 Nose-dived and crashed-killed 157 Boeing 737 Max; 4.

And they’re not who you think.,"Fans of the South Korean K-pop group are coming to Las Vegas with money in their pockets and philanthropy in their hearts.

The fans of BTS aren’t who we thought they were.

In 90 minutes the South Korean pop sensation sold out four shows at Allegiant Stadium next Friday and Saturday and April 15 and 16 and an army of fans — that’s what they call themselves BTS Army — will invade the city from all corners of the world to watch the band over two weekends.

The Review-Journal called attention to the show sellouts as one of the tourism success stories of the $2 billion 65000-seat stadium and that BTS fans seem to skew younger than the average concertgoer.

But BTS fans immediately took to Twitter to remind everybody that they’re not a bunch of teeny-boppers who will have to be chaperoned to concerts by their parents.

The BTS Army bristles at the notion that they’re all a bunch of too-young-to-legally-gamble screamers following a “boy band” — another term they dislike.

Sources say BTS fans skew younger than most band fans — and they do if you compare them with fans of the Rolling Stones Metallica and Billy Joel who also have had successful concert dates at Allegiant.

Fans from across the globe

One person who anticipated the potential for selling out the stadium was Jared Braverman senior vice president of touring for Live Nation which connected BTS to Allegiant.

“We knew there would be incredible demand given the limited number of shows BTS is currently doing in the U.S. and given that demand it was important to accommodate as many of their fans as possible that want to see BTS live” he said.

The loyal and dedicated followers are coming from across the globe to Las Vegas for the four shows Braverman said.

“Not only does BTS have a global fan base but Vegas is also a big travel market so we are seeing fans come from all over the world to see these stadium shows” he said.

And as far as the age of the target audience the decision on where to perform comes from the singers themselves.

“There are a lot of different factors and discussions that go into deciding when and where we book shows but the decision is mainly driven by artist priorities and what type of experience the artists want to deliver for their fans” Braverman said. “We don’t take booking a group like BTS in four stadium shows lightly. There is always a lot of preparation and planning that goes into producing an event of this scale.”

Since July more than 1 million people have attended events at Allegiant and researchers say 86 percent of them wouldn’t have traveled to Las Vegas had it not been for the stadium event.

The same is expected when BTS arrives.

So who are these people?

Kristine Krupa-Hinsey of Reading Pennsylvania and Nicole Caselius of Milwaukee are both members in good standing of the BTS Army.

Both initially connected with the group because they were good moms who investigated what their daughters were listening to online. Krupa-Hinsey and her husband will fly to Las Vegas this month to attend two of the shows.

“I didn’t pay a lot of attention until maybe 2017 and (my daughter) was really really into them and I said ‘What’s going on? What’s up with these guys? Why are they so interesting?’” she said. “And then I really started to pay more attention and guess who’s the bigger fan now?”

Krupa-Hinsey said her daughter has moved on from BTS leaving her as the No. 1 fan in the household. But a concert the family attended at Citi Field in New York was a musical highlight.

“My husband and I both left the concert saying that it was the best concert we had ever been to” she said. “The energy around the stadium you just have to be there. And the crowd was filled with grandmothers and toddlers as well as other adults.”

Caselius had a Korea connection in her life well before she began checking out her daughter’s musical preferences after being stationed there as a Marine.

“I was interested that my daughter was suddenly interested in Korean culture” she said. “I wanted to know what she was listening to and wanted to know a little more so I started looking up their videos and looking at their lyrics. What are they saying to her? What are they telling her to do? What are they putting in her young mind? One of the first songs I pulled up was based on a book by Hermann Hesse and I love classic literature so I was very surprised. A lot of the literature references in their music was a big thing for me that kept me looking deeper and deeper.”

While she won’t be coming to Las Vegas she said members of her family went to a show in Los Angeles. A crew assigned to pick up trash after the concert told Caselius they were amazed that concertgoers picked up after themselves and there wasn’t much trash for the crew to gather.

“I have seen people with incredible acts of kindness between individual people or small groups of people nothing as grand as the $1 million donation” she added referring to BTS’ donation to Black Lives Matter. “We help each other. We have lawyers. We have medical professionals. Anything you can imagine. That’s because BTS inspires us to do those things just to be good people.”

To that end BTS fans are a lot like the Black Hole denizens of the Las Vegas Raiders. They’re generally good people with admirable goals despite dressing up in scary costumes that make some pause.

Demographic spending

The color of choice for BTS Army is purple but residents of Las Vegas can count on seeing a lot of green when they arrive.

The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority researched what several different generations of visitors spend when they come to the city.

While millennials spend an average of $1556 on their trips to the city and have gambling budgets that average $397 some of the older generations spend much more. The LVCVA says Generation X spends $1776 and on average gambles $770 baby boomers spend $1894 and play with $772 in the casinos while the Silent Generation spends $2128 and gambles $1260.

Those numbers are based on stays ranging from 4.4 to 4.6 days on average.

For that reason the resorts are hoping to see a lot of purple in town next month.

Eric J. Holcomb at the Indiana State Capitol on March 3 to seeing his name in bright lights on the marquee of the Tryon Theater in North Carolina on Dec. 13 four-time Indy 500 winner Helio Castroneves has taken quite a ride with the Borg-Warner Trophy.

It was 2014 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay who said an Indy 500 victory is the gift that keeps on giving.

For BorgWarner the company has made sure there is a surprise at every stop for Castroneves who became the fourth four-time winner of the Indianapolis 500 on May 30 2021.

BorgWarner commissioned the Borg-Warner Trophy in 1935 and has awarded it annually since 1936 as the permanent trophy featuring every winner of the Indianapolis 500 since the beginning in 1911 (longtime Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony Hulman is also on the trophy).

SURPRISING REACTIONS: The touching messages Helio received after his fourth Indy win

Castroneves is one of only four with four faces on the iconic trophy. The others are AJ Foyt (1961 ’64 ’67 and ’77 wins); Al Unser ('70 ’71 ’78 ’87) and Rick Mears ('79 ’84 ’88 and ’91).

NBCSports.com recently tagged along with Castroneves for a behind-the-scenes look at how his face becomes part of the trophy -- from a trip to William Behrends’ studio to the wraps coming off the Borg-Warner Trophy at the Indiana State Capitol.

Here are some highlights from Castroneves’ “Trophy Trail.”

WILLIAM BEHRENDS STUDIO Dec. 13 2021

Castroneves arrived on a postcard-perfect day at Behrends’ sculpting studio which located at his home that overlooks the beautiful mountains and valleys around Tryon North Carolina. The picturesque community located in the escarpment of the Blue Ridge Mountains near the South Carolina state line bills itself as “The Friendliest Town in the South.”

Behrends a famed sculptor who has been commissioned by BorgWarner to sculpt every face on the trophy beginning with Arie Luyendyk’s first Indy 500 win in 1990 was ready for the next step in the process that had begun the morning after Castroneves won a thrilling 105th Indy 500.

Twenty years after his first Indy 500 victory Castroneves showed up in the early morning of Memorial Day 2021 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway for a series of photos shot by BorgWarner and supervised by Behrends who began working on a life-sized clay head depicting the driver.

Castroneves arrived in Tryon seven months later for a “live study” in the studio of Behrends who would add further detail.

“All right Will so now is the big moment” Castroneves said to Behrends as the wraps came off the sculpture. “Let’s see how you did now because I believe I’m much better looking than when I was younger. I’m getting older I’m like wine better looking.”

The Brazilian reacted with typical hyperbole to the clay.

“Oh My God – is this Tom Cruise?” Castroneves quipped. “It’s so amazing. This is incredible. My hair looks amazing too.

“I’m looking at myself. This is weird. This is amazing. Wow. I’m looking at a twin here. This is incredible. I’ve seen the trophy but this is my head. Great job.

“Man this is crazy. I like this guy. Will you are the man.”

Behrends has been commissioned for oversized pieces of former U.S. vice presidents that are displayed in the United States Capitol in Washington D.C. He also has created oversize statues outside the San Francisco Giants’ ballpark of Willie Mays Willie McCovey Juan Marichal Orlando Cepeda and Gaylord Perry.

His art on the Borg-Warner Trophy is creating a life-size image then working it down to the egg-sized casting that is added to the trophy.

Behrends started as a “one-off” with Luyendyk. BorgWarner liked his work so much he has been doing it ever since. Helio Castroneves’ is the 32nd Indy winner done by Behrends for the Borg-Warner Trophy.

“Guys in the Renaissance used clay” Behrends said. “They will do a study in clay then they will do a model and measure it up. On big statues I do one this size then one middle size and then the big one. There is a purpose for that. When you work that scale things change. You don’t know until it gets bigger than you may have missed something.”

Said Castroneves “I’m glad my face is familiar to you.”

“Not so much over 12 years” Behrends said referring to Castroneves’ previous victory in 2009.

Castroneves who will turn 47 on May 10 won the 2001 Indy 500 as a rookie. Then next year he became the only driver to win in his first two attempts at the Brickyard. He nearly went three in a row in 2003 finishing 0.299 seconds behind Team Penske teammate Gil de Ferran.

But it would be under the most unusual circumstances that Castroneves would return to victory lane at the 2009 Indianapolis 500.

Instead of racing to start that season Castroneves was fighting to remain a free man at a Miami federal courthouse while facing U.S. tax evasion charges.

Team owner Roger Penske promised Castroneves his ride back if he were acquitted. In the meantime a young driver from Australia named Will Power filled in at Team Penske.

Castroneves was acquitted on April 17 2009 and Castroneves drove to his third Indy 500 win on May 24 2009.

“In 2001 it was my first oval win so I could do this” Castroneves recalled. “Before I had not won on an oval. That was very emotional for me. In 2002 it was back-to-back and we didn’t have the fastest car. We were about to be one lap down and then all the chaos that I didn’t know about until after the race. I had no doubt I was leading the race. For me it was super special for the back-to-back.

“In 2009 I didn’t even start the season that year and didn’t know I would be racing and all of a sudden I’m in the Winner’s Circle.”

Castroneves came close two more times before his historic win in 2021.

In 2014 he was in a fierce battle with Ryan Hunter-Reay in the closing laps before losing by six hundredths of a second in the second-closest finish in Indy 500 history. In 2017 he was involved in another intense battle with Takuma Sato in the closing laps but lost to the Japanese by 0.201 seconds.

“In 2014 I remember (Penske) got upset with me and said I left the door open” Castroneves recalled. “I said ‘R.P. he went through the grass. What do you mean I left the door open? He went through the grass.’ ”

Castroneves believes those two close losses prepared him for the dramatic battle with Alex Palou in the closing laps of the 2021 Indy 500.

“Any time you don’t win a race it’s tough” Castroneves said. “Any time you finish second in the Indy 500 especially when you have won before and know how amazing it is it crushes you. But those three losses helped me win last year. I realized I had to wait until the last moment and that is what really helped me. Those losses turned out to be a good lesson to accomplish No. 4.

“Nobody had us as a contender. All of a sudden we dominated the way we did. And history becoming the No. 4 win and joining the Gods of racing. It was absolutely special.”

Behrends had sculpted the face of a four-time Indianapolis 500 winner before when Mears won in 1991 but Castroneves still was a first for the sculptor.

“He is the first four-time winner I’ve gotten to do all four of” Behrends said. “Rick Mears’ fourth image was the only four-time winner that I did. Helio’s last victory was in 2009 12 years ago. So I always like to go back as I did with Juan Pablo Montoya. The span of years in between victories the face ages. I like to go back look at the differences start with a clean sheet of paper and do it all over again.

“This is that but also the thrill of being able to do a four-time winner.”

Over 20 years even well-conditioned athletes tend to age. What about Castroneves from 2001-21?

“Surprisingly little for 20 years” Behrends explained. “His face has changed a lot less than mine has over those 20 years. He looks good. He is clearly in shape. He has aged well but I like to see the way age matures a face and makes it more distinctive. That’s been enjoyable on this one as well.”

BorgWarner began bringing the Indy 500 winner to Behrends’ studio in 2015 when Juan Pablo Montoya won for a second time. Every Indy 500 winner since has made the trip to Tryon North Carolina but it was a first for Castroneves despite his previous three faces. He and Behrends met briefly at IMS on the Monday after his other victories.

“I had never spent more than 10 minutes with Helio” at a time Behrends said. “In those three meetings we probably spent 30 minutes together. Today we sat down for a couple hours. We got to talk to and know each other a little bit and that helped me immeasurably in my work.”

After the live study was complete Castroneves told Behrends “I hope next year I’m able to come back here for a fifth face on the Borg-Warner Trophy. You and I have some history together. Thank you for this masterpiece. This is a special experience.”

The day concluded with Helio’s name in lights on the Tryon Theatre marquee offering congratulations on his fourth Indy 500 victory -- the second year in a row that BorgWarner added that touch to the Indy 500 winner’s visit and perhaps the start of another new Indy 500 tradition.

INDIANA STATE CAPITOL INDIANAPOLIS March 3

The Indiana State Capitol was built in 1888 – 31 years before the Indianapolis Motor Speedway opened for business in 1909 and 33 years before the first Indianapolis 500 in 1911.

Castroneves was on the stage just outside the office of Indiana Gov. Eric J. Holcomb who is boyhood friends with Tim Cindric the longtime Team Penske president who was Castroneves’ strategist for his first three Indy 500 wins.

Off to the side sat the magnificent Borg-Warner Trophy. On the base was a covering and underneath was the final part of the long process that began the day after the 2021 Indy 500. It was Castroneves’ fourth face a sterling silver bas relief image of the driver about the size of an egg.

“This is one of the most historic unveilings of a likeness on the Borg-Warner Trophy we’ve ever had as Helio’s image now appears for the fourth time on this beautiful trophy” Indianapolis Motor Speedway President J. Douglas Boles said. “It’s exciting to get to celebrate something that only A.J. Foyt Al Unser and Rick Mears have done and place Helio alongside those iconic names. While Helio isn’t from Indiana he definitely knows what it means to be a Hoosier and we are proud to stand in the Indiana Statehouse today for this very special occasion.”

“This is a pretty special day and there is no place on the Planet Earth like Indianapolis in May” Gov. Holcomb said. “We can’t wait to get to the Month of May and Memorial Day and celebrate the Indianapolis 500 especially with Helio’s ‘Drive for Five.’

“I have a strong reason to believe that Helio is not done here. He is not done winning races; he is not done kissing bricks and he is not done climbing the fence. We are so proud to have Helio as part of our family but as a global ambassador to this sport and to our Hoosier Heritage.”

BorgWarner Inc. Global Director of Marketing and Public Relations Michelle Collins helped Castroneves unveil the image on the trophy that was first commissioned in 1935. “Helio and everyone at Meyer Shank Racing performed flawlessly to put their names atop the record book” Collins said. “Helio is a wonderful ambassador for the sport and everyone at BorgWarner is proud to be associated with him. We recognize his greatness and never-ending smile on and off the track.”

Gov. Holcomb also honored Castroneves with the Indiana State Flag that flew over the Indiana State Capitol Building on May 30 2021 – the day Castroneves won his fourth Indy 500. (Castroneves reciprocated by giving Holcomb a bottle of milk which has become an iconic part of the Indy 500 winner’s celebration.)

“Wow that is something very special” Castroneves said when presented the flag in a special case. “It’s a true testament how much I love this place and what the fans mean to me. This is a perfect example.”

An hour or so after the ceremony concluded Castroneves sat in a conference room in the basement of the Indiana Governor’s office reflecting on his big day and his long journey. He joke about Behrends taking “some wrinkles away which is great. But I don’t care how it looks as long as my face is on that trophy.

(AP) — Low-income and older Rhode Island residents are getting nearly $15 million in federal funding to help them save money by making their homes more energy efficient.

The Rhode Island Department of Human Services will use the funding to partner with community action agencies throughout the state to provide weatherization services to eligible households according to a statement this week from U.S. Sen. Jack Reed.

Weatherization assistance includes air sealing attic and wall insulation heating system upgrades energy audits and window and roof repair and replacement.

The program also helps with installing smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.

""Keeping your house warm in the winter isn't easy or cheap in Rhode Island — especially with rising fuel prices"" Reed said in a statement. ""That's why these federal funds are so important.""

The program also creates jobs for energy experts and contractors he said.

Every dollar invested by the Weatherization Assistance Program generates $4.50 in combined energy savings and non-energy benefits such as job creation according to the U.S Department of Energy.

Guest Columnists

There is a solution to the housing crisis that is closing local businesses forcing residents to move away destroying our sense of community and preventing us from staffing our firehouses and hospitals. If we don’t act now however that solution may be for Boston and not include the Cape and Islands.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is rightfully making a loud and compelling case that her city can no longer put up with empty waterfront condos owned only as investments — and at the same time having teachers police nurses and firefighters who can’t afford to live where they work.

Ready set bid!:Cash no contingencies and escalator clauses more common in Cape home sales

Sound familiar?

Municipalities around the commonwealth have a terrible problem as is reflected in the many home rule petitions for housing transfer fees already filed by Nantucket Chatham Truro Provincetown Wellfleet Somerville Cambridge Arlington Brookline Concord and now Boston.

A statewide optional transfer fee of up to 2% on high-end real estate sales would provide a local tool allowing any community that has a problem and chooses to participate to determine the kind of housing relief they want and need.

We know transfer fees work. Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket have had successful transfer fee programs for decades benefitting conservation recreation and open space through their land banks.

We’ve all seen the signs on the doors of local restaurants and shops that are struggling or shuttered because there aren’t enough of us who can afford to live and work here. We have seen the astronomical price tags that have pushed even modest Cape Cod homes far beyond the reach of hardworking families. Our hospital leaders have repeatedly warned us they cannot properly staff their facilities because frontline workers can’t live here.

It gets worse. Seniors are priced out. Teachers can’t live where the children they teach live. Police officers reside an hour from the Outer Cape towns they serve. Year-round community members are living on couches and in their cars so they can stay in the place they call home.

Chapter 40B:1960s state law designed to spur affordable housing growth has failed on Cape Cod

Just read the news:

Two years ago the median home price on the Cape was $450000 — now it is $620000

Chatham was recently named one of the 10 hottest markets in the country with a realtor adding: “We’re seeing a lot of buyers come in from Boston New York and San Francisco to purchase second homes that they rent out for part of the year as investment properties.”

Since 2016 when Nantucket introduced a similar measure to what Wu is now proposing the median home price on the Island has increased 85% to $2.78 million.

Broken system:To understand Cape Cod's housing crisis look at what's happening at Twin Brooks

When it comes to the housing crisis each community’s problem is different. Existing state and federal programs just can’t deal with all the housing issues on the Cape and Islands. Passage of statewide transfer fee legislation would allow each city or town to craft a local solution.

A town that chooses to participate can set the amount of the fee — up to 2% of the transaction — on the buyer or the seller. By setting a threshold price for a home sale it puts the fee only on high-end transactions. The community can also build in protections for elderly home sellers as well as first-time homebuyers.

The transfer fee isn’t necessarily about building more. Towns can use the money for deed restrictions that preserve existing homes at reasonable prices for year-rounders.

Looking for solutions:Balancing both housing needs and conservation a tough feat for Emblem Hyannis

Still real estate and developer associations are lining up their lobbyists on Beacon Hill to oppose the modest transfer fee. However they have a problem. The local real estate professionals know there is a crisis and many of them are stepping forward to say the Massachusetts Association of Realtors does not speak for them on this issue. After all they live here too.

Boston’s legislation is building momentum giving us an opportunity. Our legislators need all of us to speak up and let House and Senate leadership know the housing crisis is destroying the quality of life on the Cape and Islands and a simple transfer fee for housing is a critical tool that we need here too.

Do we really want to spend another year watching neighbors move away to somewhere they can actually afford to live? The pandemic allowed us all to see that everyone who makes up our communities are essential personnel and the sense of community that once marked every single one of our towns is dying.

If all this strikes a chord we encourage you to reach out to the Statehouse today.

The retracted studies led by ophthalmologist Dr. Jorge Arroyo include one published in Wiley Online Library in June 2021 that was retracted in February because the study was conducted in a way that differed from the protocol approved by BIDMC. Another study published in March 2021 in Translational Vision Science & Technology was retracted in March for failing to obtain institutional approval at all.

A former Harvard professor and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center doctor has had eight research studies or abstracts retracted by three different medical journals for problems with critical oversight approvals for the research.

Internal approvals known as “institutional review board” or “internal review board” approvals are required for all research involving human subjects. In their retractions the journals called the problems “a serious issue.”

The news was first reported by the blog Retraction Watch.

Arroyo was a Harvard Medical School teacher and director of Retina Service at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for 18 years. According to his LinkedIn page he left those positions in December 2021. That same month Wiley said they were notified of the IRB issues.

Arroyo now works as a vitreoretinal surgeon for Boston Vision a private practice with multiple locations in Massachusetts according to the company’s website.

When reached by phone Arroyo said he would rather not discuss the retractions and said he preferred not to say anything about the timing of his departure from BIDMC.

“It’s a complicated issue and all I can say is people make mistakes” he said.

He later added in a statement that the articles were retracted “as part of my cooperation with the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center during their review of this matter.”

The retractions include studies that used noninvasive technology to measure blood flow in the retina dozens of people given oxygen through face masks for several hours and volunteers who inhaled CO2 rich air oxygen and a medical gas mixture of carbon dioxide in medical oxygen to study changes in the eye.

At least one study recruited patients from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Eye Clinic. Another used subjects diagnosed by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center’s retina services.

Beth Israel Lahey Health the parent company of BIDMC said the hospital did not inform patients who were in the retracted clinical trials because they were receiving supplemental oxygen as part of their clinical care and not just through a clinical trial. The health system also said the patients consented to the treatment and weren’t harmed by the treatment. The health system noted Arroyo no longer worked for the hospital.

“We uphold the highest research standards and rigorously maintain the integrity of our research” said Terri Janos a spokeswoman for BILH. “Any concerns are thoroughly reviewed in accordance with institutional policies and applicable regulations.”

The Committee on Clinical Investigations which oversees clinical trials at BIDMC and functions as the institution’s IRB did not respond to requests for comment. Harvard Medical School referred questions to BIDMC saying the institution oversaw the research.

Industry experts voiced concern about the retractions and said seeking IRB approval is so fundamental to conducting clinical trials with human subjects that it is almost mundane.

“You cannot recruit research subjects without IRB approval and he knows that” said George Annas the director of the Center for Health Law Ethics & Human Rights at Boston University School of Public Health. “People hate the IRBs they think they are bureaucratic. But they understand it is essential. If you want to be a researcher you go to the IRB. Usually you say that on every application that goes to a journal that this was approved by the IRB. … That is not a trivial omission.”

Arroyo is also not new to clinical research. According to his biography with Boston Vision he has published over 60 studies in peer-reviewed journals.

Institutions that conduct research involving human subjects typically convene a panel of experts that must review clinical trials before they commence. According to the Food and Drug Administration which has developed regulations overseeing how institutional review boards function this board reviews research protocols consent documents investigator brochures and more to protect the rights and welfare of the people who agree to participate.

BIDMC’s Committee on Clinical Investigations stipulates that before the committee reviews a research proposal the proposal is analyzed by the scientific review officer evaluating if there is merit to justify using human subjects that the risks of clinical trials with humans outweigh the rewards that the potential risks have been accurately and fully described in the consent form and that there is adequate safety monitoring of the research.

Most critically IRB reviews help patients differentiate between things that are treatment and things that are research Annas said.

“You need expert outside people to distinguish between research and treatment and that whoever is doing the research knows what they are doing” Annas said.

Delivering oxygen also isn’t so innocuous as to not require oversight. Annas said the risks of high amounts of oxygen are well known and said premature babies given too much oxygen are at risk of going blind.

Dr. Steven Woloshin founder of the Lisa Schwartz Foundation for Truth in Medicine said IRB approval typically is conducted before people are recruited for a trial. Even studies involving surveys must go through IRB approval.

“There are historically horrible examples that stuff under the name of research has gone horribly wrong” he said. “The idea is to protect people and the system works so people feel good about being involved and the risks they are taking are worthwhile.”

Art Caplan a bioethicist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine said there are no regulations that require researchers or institutional review boards to notify patients who participate in retracted research but scientists have an ethical duty.

“When you retract you have an ethical duty to tell subjects what happened” Caplan said. “Why was their participation in vain?”

Depending on the volume of rainfall and snowmelt up to 500 million gallons of sewage mixed with storm water are discharged into the harbor via the two rivers every year.

The cleanup of Boston Harbor is considered one of the great environmental success stories of our time — and deservedly so. It has helped transform the quality of life in the metro Boston area as residents and businesses live work and play near the newly cleaned up harbor and the rivers that feed into it.

These discharges flow from old underground pipe networks known as combined sewer systems engineering relics that were designed to collect rainwater runoff domestic sewage and industrial wastewater in the same pipe leading to a treatment plant. But during periods of heavy rainfall or snowmelt the wastewater volume can exceed the pipe’s capacity causing a combined sewer overflow or CSO that dumps the polluted contents directly into the rivers.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Clean Water Act. Relying on sewage infrastructure that was designed in the 1800s is the equivalent of continuing to travel by horse and buggy. Massachusetts must do better and needs to do it now as climate change brings more intense storms more severe flooding and more sewage overflows.

The landmark litigation that began in the 1980s and catalyzed the Boston Harbor cleanup charged the newly created Massachusetts Water Resources Authority with developing and implementing a long-term control plan for reducing CSO discharges. To its credit the MWRA has made dramatic progress.

Prior to the cleanup a staggering 1.7 billion gallons of polluted wastewater were discharged annually into the lower Charles between the Watertown Dam and Boston Harbor. That volume has been reduced to no more than 500 million gallons from CSOs in the past few years.

Yet despite considerable investment the MWRA is poised to fall short of targets set in its plan which still allows for 85 million gallons of combined sewage discharge into the Charles and Mystic river systems annually. Currently 16 CSO outfalls remain that did not achieve the levels mandated by the court within the 20-year time frame. Six of these outfalls are expected to achieve compliance by 2024 and the MWRA has developed conceptual plans which if implemented may help address an additional four. But there is no plan for bringing the remaining six outfalls — five in the Charles and one in the Mystic — into compliance.

Indeed the MWRA in 2021 requested a three-year extension for compliance to 2024 and expressed concern about whether the costs to achieve compliance would be worth the benefit.

Boston Harbor was once considered the most polluted harbor in America and cost was the argument raised by generations of political leaders as the reason not to clean it up. If we had listened to those voices we would not have spent the $4.5 billion to clean the harbor and enable a thriving waterfront and enviable urban beaches that have together become an economic driver of the entire region.

Granted there is fierce competition for public dollars. But there have been many technological advances in CSO control since the 1990s when infrastructure planning began. Experiences in other cities have shown that installing green infrastructure in CSO drainage areas is particularly cost-effective — think of rain gardens porous pavement and green roofs — for temporarily storing the rainwater and keeping it from overwhelming the system.

An incomplete cleanup of Boston Harbor with potentially hundreds of millions of gallons of sewage flowing into the Charles and Mystic rivers and ultimately into Boston Harbor every year as climate change only fuels the problem is unacceptable.

Massachusetts residents should not settle for less than healthy rivers and harbors. Federal infrastructure funds are available for exactly the kinds of efforts needed to reduce and finally eliminate CSOs.

Only then will the task of cleaning up Boston Harbor be truly worthy of the praise heaped upon it.

Findings from a Cleveland Clinic-led clinical trial showed that the use of an experimental drug in severely symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients significantly reduced the need for invasive procedures.

The trial evaluated whether the drug mavacamten could be used as an alternative to heart surgery or alcohol septal ablation therapies used to reduce thickening of the septum the wall separating the right and left sides of the heart.

Findings from the “VALOR-HCM Study: Myosin Inhibition as an Alternative to Surgical Myectomy or Alcohol Septal Ablation in Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy” were presented today during a Late Breaking Science Session at the American College of Cardiology’s 71st Annual Scientific Session in Washington D.C.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a complex type of heart disease that causes thickening of the heart muscle left ventricular stiffness and mitral valve changes. It affects an estimated 600000 to 1.5 million Americans or one in 500 people but many of those patients go undiagnosed until the disease has progressed.

Milind Desai M.D.

The cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be unknown or attributed to genetics high blood pressure or aging making it difficult to identify a high-risk population. Symptoms include chest pain palpitations shortness of breath fatigue and syncope (fainting). Most people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have a low risk for sudden cardiac death. However the condition is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in people under age 30.

Medications such as beta-blockers calcium channel blockers and antiarrhythmics are often prescribed to treat the symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and prevent further complications. Patients with persistent symptoms may also undergo a septal myectomy in which a surgeon removes a small amount of the thickened septal wall to widen the outflow tract (the path the blood takes) from the left ventricle to the aorta. Another option is alcohol ablation a cardiac catheterization procedure where a tiny amount of pure alcohol is injected into the septum causing it to shrink back to a more normal size and widening the passage for blood flow.

The VALOR-HCM phase 3 trial enrolled 112 symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients at 19 sites across the United States. All of the patients were referred to have surgical myectomy or alcohol ablation. They were randomized to an oral myosin inhibitor mavacamten (5 to 15 mg daily) or placebo. Mavacamten works by reducing excessive contraction of the heart muscle making it work more efficiently. It also reduces the stiffness of the heart muscle.

Steven E. Nissen M.D.

After 16 weeks 43 of the 56 placebo-treated patients (76.8%) continued to meet guideline criteria for surgery or elected to undergo surgery compared with 10/56 (17.9%) mavacamten-treated patients. The study demonstrated significant reduction in left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient in mavacamten-treated patients along with improvements in quality-of- life measures. The long-term safety and outcomes of mavacamten will continue to be studied.

“These results could give what can be a very sick patient population a non-invasive therapy alternative” said Milind Desai M.D. MBA director of the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center and director of clinical operations in Cleveland Clinic’s Heart Vascular & Thoracic Institute and principal investigator of the trial. “There are few high-volume centers performing septal myectomy or alcohol ablations which may limit a patient’s access to optimal results and patients may need repeat interventions. That is why it is vital to explore non-invasive options for these patients.”

Steven E. Nissen M.D. Chief Academic Officer of the Heart Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic and the trials’ senior author said “The vast majority of the patients even those in the placebo group chose to continue the drug after 16 weeks suggesting a strong desire for this type of treatment option.”

The trial was funded by MyoKardia Inc a wholly owned subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb (Brisbane CA) and coordinated by Cleveland Clinic Coordinating Center for Clinical Research (C5Research) and Medpace (Cincinnati OH).

Florian Rader MD MSc associate professor of Cardiology and medical director of the Hypertension Center in the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai presented results of an international clinical trial that shows the drug mavacamten alleviated the shortness of breath in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

The genetic condition causes thickening of the heart muscle and as a result heart muscle cells enlarge and scarring often develops between cells. Patients with the condition typically experience shortness of breath chest pressure irregular heartbeat and although rare sudden cardiac arrest.

“Until now existing treatments for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been suboptimal leaving most patients symptomatic and often in need of invasive or even open-heart surgery” said Rader who served as site principal investigator of the clinical trial at Cedars-Sinai and lead author of the ACC late-breaking abstract. “Follow-up data from this extended clinical trial shows success in lessening the obstruction to blood flow out of the heart in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Along with this relief of obstruction came substantial improvements in symptoms and an important heart failure blood biomarker.”

As Rader also co-director of the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Clinic at Cedars-Sinai explained in the late-breaking presentation mavacamten showed preliminary success in relieving symptoms associated with the condition—specifically shortness of breath which can be debilitating for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients.

Key data from the clinical trial—shared by Rader at ACC22—includes:

· The average age of the 231 clinical trial participants was 60 years old and 39% of those on the trial were female. The median follow-up was 62 weeks.

· 69% of trial participants had improved shortness of breath after 48 weeks of treatment.

· Treatment with mavacamten was generally well tolerated and no new safety concerns were raised during longer-term follow-up.

Since the condition was first described some 60 years ago Rader says no disease-specific targeted treatment options have been developed.

While the prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is roughly 1 in every 200 patients Rader says the condition is thought to be widely underdiagnosed.

“A lot of patients have the condition—and often feel short of breath or palpitations—but their doctor doesn’t recognize these symptoms as stemming from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy” said Rader. “Instead patients may be told by their physician they are out of shape need to lose weight or are suffering from an anxiety condition.”

The correct approach Rader says is to first pay close attention to the patient’s symptoms. If shortness of breath is a main concern then a doctor should listen to the patient’s heart for a murmur then follow up with an electrocardiogram and ultimately an echocardiogram which most often will lead to the correct diagnosis.

Christine M. Albert MD MPH professor chair of the Department of Cardiology and the Lee and Harold Kapelovitz Distinguished Chair in Cardiology says this treatment option is specifically designed for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy—a welcome change for patients who have suffered for years.

“This is the largest and longest report of mavacamten in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy” said Albert who is also participating at ACC. “We are encouraged to learn that it once again proved safe and effective. We are excited to be at the forefront of bringing this investigational treatment to patients.”

The drug was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb and is under consideration for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

WASHINGTON DC (UPDATED)—Among patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) who are candidates for surgical or interventional septal reduction therapy (SRT) despite being on maximally tolerated medical therapy adding the novel targeted myosin-inhibitor drug (Bristol Myers Squibb) for 16 weeks significantly reduces the need for such therapy compared with placebo according to results of the VALOR-HCM trial.

Milind Desai (Source ACC)

The results presented today at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 2022 Scientific Session bolster those seen in the EXPLORER-HCM trial which showed the potential of adjunctive mavacamten in patients with obstructive HCM to increase peak exercise capacity and improve postexercise left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient peak VO 2  and NYHA class through 30 weeks. Additional data have shown the drug’s ability to greatly improve quality of life through 38 weeks.

Unlike in EXPLORER-HCM the 112 patients randomized to mavacamten or placebo in VALOR-HCM were “maxed out on medical treatment and their backs were against the wall to a point where the next stop was surgery or interventional procedure” Milind Y. Desai MD MBA (Cleveland Clinic OH) who presented the findings told TCTMD.

“These findings certainly add a lot to . . . the mavacamten story” he continued. “VALOR adds to the fact that in this group of highly symptomatic patients at least for the duration of the trial . . . it can give an alternative option to patients to delay surgery defer surgery or in some cases completely avoid surgery.”

This is a remarkable study that if confirmed in larger ones would change the lives for potentially thousands of patients in the US alone. Paul Sorajja

Until now “we have been repurposing drugs that we have for other causes” like beta-blockers calcium channel blockers and disopyramide to treat obstructive HCM said Michael Papadakis MD (St George's University of London England) who was not involved with the study. Mavacamten which decreases the number of myosin-actin cross-bridges and reduces excessive contractility was specifically developed for patients with HCM and given the designation of breakthrough therapy by the US Food and Drug Administration.

“It was about time that we got something new in our armamentarium and we look forward for it to be approved as a medication and hopefully start using it with our patients” Papadakis told TCTMD.

Also commenting on the findings for TCTMD Paul Sorajja MD (Minneapolis Heart Institute MN) told TCTMD in an email that “this is a remarkable study that if confirmed in larger ones would change the lives for potentially thousands of patients in the US alone. It is noteworthy that the data in VALOR-HCM are internally consistent with benefits for patients seen objectively and subjectively across laboratory findings echo data and clinical symptom improvement.”

The FDA will make a decision on mavacamten this month the fast-tracked drug has a Prescription Drug User Fee Amendment (PDUFA) date of April 28 2022.

Most No Longer SRT Eligible

For the study Desai and colleagues included 112 patients (mean age 60 years; about half women; 85% white) with obstructive HCM—with maximum septal wall thickness on echocardiography ≥ 15 mm or ≥ 13 mm with family history—who continued to have severe symptoms (92.9% NYHA class III or higher) despite maximally tolerated medical therapy (46% on beta-blockers; 20% on disopyramide). All were enrolled at one of 19 high-volume US centers and had been referred for SRT (87% to myectomy) within the prior 12 months and were actively considering scheduling the procedure.

Notably for the 56 patients who were randomized to receive mavacamten dosing started at 5 mg once daily and was either up or down titrated at 8 and 12 weeks based on core lab-measured LVEF LVOT gradient at rest and Valsalva provocation. “This is how we would be managing patients in real life” Desai explained.

After 16 weeks only 17.9% of patients treated with mavacamten remained guideline-eligible to receive SRT (defined as LVOT gradient of ≥ 50 mm Hg and NYHA class III-IV) compared with 76.8% of the placebo arm (primary endpoint; P < 0.0001).

Additionally each of the secondary endpoints of postexercise LVOT NYHA class Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score and NT-proBNP and troponin levels were all improved with mavacamten versus placebo (all P < 0.001). Specifically 63% and 27% of patients in the study respectively saw improvements by one and two NYHA classes.

There were no severe adverse events noted with mavacamten with only two patients needing to temporarily stop the drug due to EF falling below 50%. Desai noted that there were no permanent discontinuations needed due to EF falling below 30%. A handful of patients in the study arm reported nausea and a rash.

Desai said it was meaningful that only a total of four patients from the entire study—two from each group—opted to proceed with SRT. “The point here is: if given a choice patients at least in this study were more likely to choose medical therapy over an invasive procedure” he said.

If performed in an experienced center SRT is a “very safe and excellent procedure” he acknowledged. However average US mortality with SRT is 5.9% and can range up to 16% at low-volume centers. With as many as 20 million HCM patients in the world Desai argued that “it is an issue of superior outcomes and access to those superior outcomes. And there's just not enough centers.”

In discussion following the presentation of the VALOR-HCM results Lynne Warner Stevenson MD (Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville TN) called the design of the study “brave.”

“You picked a subjective endpoint but you took the risk and you jumped to the top of the pyramid because you answered in one step the question of ‘What does this actually mean to the patient?” which often takes much longer” she said. “Fortunately it is validated by the objective evaluation of the LVOT gradient as well as the BNP because demonstrating they no longer would've met criteria for SRT.”

Although she continued 16 weeks was “pretty quick” to reach their “ambitious” endpoint given existing concerns about a new medication that decreases contractility. She asked: should clinicians use as similar uptitration schedule once mavacamten is available for widespread use?

“Like anything new that comes to the market there has to be the appropriate amount of trepidation the appropriate amount of judicious observation of abnormal signals that needs to happen” Desai responded. Because they studied a clinically relevant endpoint he said after the drug is approved patients would need to be monitored serially to assess ejection fraction as well as clinical LVOT measurements.

Similarly Michael Mack MD (Baylor Scott & White Heart Hospital Plano TX) also praised the authors for an “incredibly impressive trial” during the discussion. Long-term he asked whether macavamten should be thought of as “background therapy” before undergoing any intervention “now that we have surgery alcohol septal ablation and maybe now even radio frequency ablation from China.”

Desai said it “needs to be tested in a trial fashion but the answer is yes. Everybody should be offered background therapy before you offer them an intervention.”

‘Real-world Scenario’

The value the VALOR-HCM trial brings above what has been previously published is that it presents more of a “real-world scenario” in terms of the kind of patients included as well as how mavacamten was dosed Papadakis said. Specifically EXPLORER-HCM excluded patients on disopyramide due to concerns about drug-drug interactions affecting QT interval.

“What that means in practice is that if it gets approved that I will have patients in my clinic on beta-blockers in combination with disopyramide potentially” he said. “And then I can add mavacamten on top of that if they remain symptomatic and monitor the result. And if they got a very good result that potentially one could contemplate leaving them on mavacamten and gradually trying to withdraw the rest of the treatment.”

It's going to be difficult obviously to investigate whether it can actually change the course of the disease even in people who don't have LVOT obstruction and in younger individuals. Michael Papadakis

Desai acknowledged a couple limitations of the study in that like EXPLORER-HCM the VALOR-HCM trial was conducted mostly in white patients who were treated at established centers although he did point to the fact that women and men were equally represented.

“Unfortunately this reflects the reality of practice in the USA” he said. “But HCM as best we can tell is an equal-opportunity offender based on ethnicity. Time will tell and expansion into a broader group of patients will shed future light.”

Papadakis agreed that future research should look at how mavacamten works in other racial/ethnic groups especially since Black patients tend to “exhibit greater hypertrophy” for example. But he acknowledged the difficulty of performing trials in inherited conditions like HCM as opposed to heart failure or CAD “because you need to select [patients] carefully and the condition is obviously not as frequent. It’s also very difficult to test hard outcomes.”

Once mavacamten is used in clinical practice “we will learn more from keeping those patients on registries and trying to collect data around the world” Papadakis added. “We can't afford to miss that opportunity because obviously there's a need to collect more data. We need to assess things like mortality. . . . It's going to be difficult obviously to investigate whether it can actually change the course of the disease even in people who don't have LVOT obstruction and in younger individuals. That would obviously revolutionize treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.”

Desai noted that 95% of the patients in VALOR-HCM have consented be followed for about 128 weeks.

For now he said “this is a clarion call as far as I'm concerned for the community to understand and improve our diagnostic capabilities in the context of HCM and understand the therapeutic options available” he said. “And in the context of something like mavacamten obviously it is a new drug so like anything new there will be some trepidation but what it will do is elevate the confidence of various folks to be able to prescribe this medication.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpY2FyZGlvbG9neS5jb20vY29udGVudC9haWRvYy1leHBhbmRzLWFpLXNlcnZpY2UteC1yYXktcmVjZWl2aW5nLWZkYS01MTBrLWNsZWFyYW5jZS1wbmV1bW90aG9yYXjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aidoc Expands AI Service to X-ray Receiving FDA 510(k) Clearance for Pneumothorax,"April 2 2022 — Aidoc a leading provider of healthcare AI solutions announced that it received FDA 510(k) clearance for its triage and notification of pneumothorax on X-ray exams. A one-stop partner for the enterprise’s clinical AI needs Aidoc’s other seven FDA-cleared solutions are already implemented across U.S. health systems flagging and communicating suspected pathologies in CT exams – and now have expanded to the high volume X-ray modality.

Aidoc’s newly FDA-cleared solution runs on all X-ray machines including portable ones and is designed to analyze X-ray images. It automatically flags positive cases of pneumothorax facilitating physicians to read X-rays in a timely manner.

The ability to quickly identify pneumothorax is imperative as it can worsen rapidly and result in respiratory or cardiac failure. This however is easier said than done due to the extensive imaging volumes radiologists have to continuously examine. Aidoc’s highly accurate AI pneumothorax algorithm addresses this challenge by analyzing X-rays flagging and notifying physicians of the suspected findings.

“We’re very excited about this important milestone” said Elad Walach CEO of Aidoc. “This FDA clearance further validates the breadth of our AI platform going beyond specific AI algorithms to act as a healthcare AI hub for the enterprise’s cross-specialty needs. This includes ER ICU outpatient centers inpatient admissions and the coordination of care and communication among providers. By bringing radiologists and proceduralists to the same AI platform we enable enhanced collaboration across departments and systems to deliver patients with the right treatment at the right time.”

Aidoc’s AI platform processes high volumes of scans and images without disrupting the physician’s workflow. Existing partners of Aidoc who add the pneumothorax solution to their portfolio will not require any additional integration infrastructure or maintenance efforts.

Nvidia's (NVDA 3.77%) dividend yield an afterthought for most investors is currently sitting at 0.06%. That is partly due to a stock price that has climbed faster than the company's dividend payments. On that score the company hasn't increased its dividend in over two years. As the company's profits have climbed on the back of strong demand for advanced graphics chips and data center systems the dividend payout ratio has dropped to less than 5%.

Here are a few reasons the company should consider returning more income to shareholders.

Nvidia's cash flow and payout history

Nvidia's profit margin improved significantly in recent years as the mix of revenue shifted to data center chips and high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) for gamers that command steep selling prices.

Over the last five years the company's free cash flow which is the amount of cash the company can spend on reinvestment in operations acquisitions dividends and share repurchases climbed 457% to $8.1 billion. That represents a high margin of 30% on $26.9 billion in fiscal 2022 revenue.

Management seems to have anticipated the company's fortunes nine years ago. Nvidia initiated its first quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share in fiscal 2012 (ended in January 2013). That year Nvidia generated $640 million in free cash flow on $4.3 billion in revenue or a free cash flow margin of about 15%.

But over the last five years Nvidia's free cash flow has increased more than 400% while the dividend has only increased 25%. Other companies that design or manufacture chips such as Apple Intel and Broadcom pay out anywhere from 14% to 58% of their free cash flow in dividends. These companies face just as much competition for their products yet they far outspend Nvidia in returning cash to shareholders through dividends.

Nvidia can afford a higher payout

Nvidia can certainly afford to double its payout to at least 10%. The total spent on dividends last year was $399 million but Nvidia has spent far more on share repurchases. Since August 2004 management has spent over $7 billion repurchasing shares. After spending $2 billion to repurchase shares in the recent quarter they currently have another $5 billion left on their share repurchase authorization through the end of December 2022.

The recent $2 billion buyback at these high valuation levels is questionable. Nvidia previously spent $1.6 billion to buy back shares in 2018 when the stock traded at an attractive valuation of around 20 times earnings. Management did not repurchase any shares between 2020 and 2021 as the stock's valuation soared.

So why did management repurchase shares recently with the stock trading at a nosebleed valuation of 69 times trailing earnings? It would have made more sense from a capital allocation perspective to shift at least some of that cash return to dividends as opposed to buying back shares at these levels.

Furthermore Nvidia's share repurchases have been completely ineffective in enhancing shareholder returns over the last 18 years. The annual diluted share count has increased 20% over that time which means the amount spent on buybacks has only partially offset the dilution to shareholders.

At the end of January Nvidia was sitting on a net cash balance of $10.3 billion and given management's anticipation of further growth in free cash flow that cash balance should continue to pile up over the long term.

Demand trends in data centers and gaming should continue to lift gross margin and Nvidia's profitability. Management expects new software opportunities with Nvidia AI Enterprise and Nvidia Omniverse will benefit the company's bottom line. ""Each one of these software offerings has a multibillion-dollar revenue potential and should contribute positively to our gross margins over time"" said CFO Colette Kress at Nvidia's recent investor day.

Given Nvidia's expanding margins and opportunities Nvidia should reconsider its capital return priorities. If the company is not going to reduce the share count and boost returns to investors with repurchases it should shift more of its capital returns to dividends.",,,,,,,,,,,,

While she spent time in New York City in late April her absence from the event isn’t too surprising as she has been filming Stranger Things’ final season away from the city.

This has been a big year for Brown in the fashion space as the actress expanded her Florence by Mills line into clothing at the beginning of 2024. She spoke to ELLE.com in January about how her own experience dressing for red carpets led to the decision.

“[When Stranger Things took off] I was 10” she said. “I was going to these events and ceremonies and all these big fashion brands wanted to style me. I didn’t know what my personal style was and the only time I got dressed other than for ceremonies was to go to work. As I got older I was like ‘What is my personal style?’ A lot of my friends already knew [their styles] but I didn’t know mine. For me fashion has always been ever-evolving. It’s fluid and I wanted to create something so that girls going through that similar experience have a resource to be able to try innovative new outfits and styles and phases. I wanted to be able to create something that was accessible to my generation to my demographic so that when they go into a store they feel like they have that one corner—even if it’s a corner in the back—that they have what they’re looking for and they’re able to afford it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDMvYnVzaW5lc3Mvc3RlcmxpY2h0LWJyb3duLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktZG9ub3IuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire Donor Barry Sternlicht Assails Brown’s Deal With Protesters,"One of Brown University’s major donors the billionaire real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht on Friday sharply criticized the school’s agreement to hold a board vote on cutting investments tied to Israel calling it “unconscionable” and saying he had “paused” donations to the school.

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZm9yd2FyZC5jb20vbmV3cy82MDk1MjYvYnJvd24tdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1hbnRpc2VtaXRpc20tcHJvdGVzdHMtZW5jYW1wbWVudC_SAVhodHRwczovL2ZvcndhcmQuY29tL25ld3MvNjA5NTI2L2Jyb3duLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktYW50aXNlbWl0aXNtLXByb3Rlc3RzLWVuY2FtcG1lbnQvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Everyone gets to be uncomfortable’: How Jewish students at Brown kept antisemitism at bay,"By Mira Fox May 3 2024

At universities and colleges across the country police are sweeping through encampments supporting Gaza trying to clear protesters from the grounds. But at Brown University’s encampment on the campus’s main green in the middle of Providence Rhode Island the biggest drama last Shabbat was that the candles would not stay lit.

This was more or less the calm atmosphere of Brown’s encampment for the six days it stood; it was not plagued by the antisemitism violence or arrests that have dominated headlines about schools including Columbia and the University of California Los Angeles. There were no clashes with counterprotesters and no police presence. The encampment’s daily schedule included tai chi and a talent show alongside teach-ins and rallies. People tossed frisbees next to the tents.

On Tuesday the protesting students at Brown reached an agreement with the university’s administration and voluntarily dismantled their encampment.

Life on the Ivy League campus wasn’t always so calm. In the wake of Oct. 7 61 students were arrested at various sit-ins. Some student groups celebrated Hamas’ massacre. People took pictures of Israeli students on campus and posted on anonymous social media with captions disparaging them as Zionists.

Fractures deepened after a Palestinian Brown undergraduate Hisham Awartani was shot in Burlington Vermont along with two other Palestinian friends; they were all wearing kaffiyehs. Brown-RISD Hillel put out a statement mourning the shooting but also castigating “a torrent of antisemitic hatred” online saying that Hillel’s “support for Israel and Zionist students is unassailable.”

Some Jewish and Israeli students who had previously been involved with Hillel broke ties calling the email “tone-deaf” and “a disgusting response to a hate crime.” At a vigil for Awartani a speaker said his blood was on the hands of Zionist students.

But around May’s encampment that vitriol seemed to have dissipated. Chants were focused on the activists’ demands — divestment not from Israel as a whole but from companies involved in the oppression of Palestinians — and not on broader statements about Zionism or Israel’s existence. Some of Brown’s most vocal Zionist students members of opposing campus group Brown Students for Israel said that they felt safe.

Students told me that the encampment chose not to chant “from the river to the sea” — common at most protests — because one student who was part of the tent group said it made them feel uncomfortable. (The chant did occur once on the encampment’s final day.)

What enabled this shift? And who planted the seeds for compromise on Brown’s central lawn?

I asked this question of many at Brown students faculty and rabbis and their answers all pointed to a willingness to cross ideological divides. Where protesters at other campuses adopted “do not engage” policies at Brown they kept talking.

“On the periphery of the encampment there were a number of students in conversation with one another some of which I think people might have imagined were unlikely pairs to be having conversations across political differences” said Jason Klein the rabbi for Jewish life in the chaplain’s office. “That’s something I think that Brown students can often do well.”

This isn’t of course to say that everyone approved of the encampment or agreed with its demands. Some students and staff at the Brown-RISD Hillel harshly criticize the campus environment. And many activists call for more extreme measures and more rigid stances — most students I spoke with mentioned more radical factions on campus that don’t fret over upsetting their peers.

But they no longer dominate at Brown.

The encampment maintained a middle ground of sorts in part due to a monthslong committed dialogue organized and run by students to talk through the toughest issues and feelings and try to understand each other.

And many students said that the relative calm and success of the protest was thanks in large part to the deep engagement of Jewish students in the campus’s activist movements.

Jews at the center

The first sit-in for divestment at Brown in November last year was composed entirely of Jewish students. In their first statement in the student newspaper The Brown Daily Herald the group mourned the murders on Oct. 7 and affirmed its “connection to the amorphous spiritual entity” of Israel but declared itself anti-Zionist.

Soon after they named themselves BrownU Jews for Ceasefire Now; many of its members were part of Brown’s encampment. JFCN as most on campus call it has organized protests or actions but also created an independent study course for those grappling with Judaism Jewish identity and Israel; organized dinners for Jews who clash over Israel; and invited other students to come and ask questions of its members promising to cast no judgment. It has also hosted weekly Shabbat services — including the one at the encampment — as well as holiday celebrations.

Maddie a senior with JFCN who spoke on condition that only her first name be used so as not to compromise her employment prospects in the Jewish professional world said the group hosts large Shabbat dinners and has created an “alternative ritual space” for Jews “who don’t want to feel like they’re praying to a flag.”

About 24% of Brown’s student body is Jewish and most of them according to Rabbi Joshua Bolton the head of the Brown-RISD Hillel “exist in a broad center and in fact they don’t necessarily feel represented by activists on either side of this issue.”

Nevertheless Jewish students comprise a significant portion — it’s not clear exactly how large — of pro-Palestinian activists on campus. Their deep engagement and leadership seems to have helped insulate the movement from becoming as divisive as on other campuses.

When an outside group from Providence came to the encampment and handed out flyers urging a global intifada over the weekend students pushed back saying that was not part of their messaging. They kept their chants focused on divestment and criticism of Brown’s leadership.

“The heavy Jewish presence in these pro-Palestine circles ensures that there will never be the extreme blatant antisemitism” said Ma’ayan Stutman-Shaw a first-year student who is not involved with the protests. “And it’s Jews who are really engaged with the Jewish community not Jews who picked up Judaism on Oct. 10 because they wanted to fight for Palestine — Jews who have been thinking about this constantly they are the ones who are leading this movement on campus.”

Of course much of the pro-Palestinian organizing has been led by non-Jewish students as well.

But much of the pushback to pro-Palestinian protests — concerns about antisemitism and what they see as calls to dismantle Israel — have come from Jewish students who are concerned about antisemitism or who have ties to Israel. And that’s where the leadership of Jewish student activists has come in.

“Jewish students are going to have a better understanding of what will trigger other Jewish students” said Asher Radziner a senior who has been leading conversations on campus.

A safety blanket

Many Jewish students I spoke to said the university encouraged conversations among students over Israel and the war but never convened any that students found inviting.

“It hasn’t really provided those spaces” said Eiden Spilker a senior involved with JFCN. “There just haven’t been contexts to engage in good faith.”

So instead students built their own.

Outside the encampment while it stood JFCN students — none of whom were camping on the green — had set up a dialogue space: a blanket and a painted canvas that said “Questions? Comments? Concerns? Come talk.”

Every day that the encampment stood at least two students sat there waiting for people to approach them. The group also facilitated conversations during a student hunger strike in February when 17 students fasted for eight days to protest the refusal of the Corporation of Brown University which governs the investment of Brown’s endowment to hear a proposal for divestment.

JFCN members said they are looking especially to engage with Jewish and Zionist students. Spilker whose father is a rabbi and whose mother is a cantor said JFCN understands where they’re coming from.

“We’ve been there and we’re in a position where we can empathize with that” he said. “It’s less about trying to convince people and more about hearing them and having dialogue and creating a space that ideally Hillel would’ve created but because of their ideology and current leadership have not been able to make.”

(“We are a home for every Jewish student” said Bolton the director of the campus Hillel when told of the criticism from some Jewish students. “That doesn’t mean that we’re a home for every type of program.”)

On blanket duty one recent morning Spilker greeted a student who introduced himself as Kareem not giving his last name and had questions. He asked about the use of the term genocide and the impact of divestment. Spilker thought before he spoke and then drew on theories he learned in classes he’d taken.

“I think it is a question of at which stage do you call it a genocide — is it just at the final stage of mass extermination?” he said.

“That’s a good point” Kareem responded. “I hadn’t heard that before that it’s a process.”

Spilker said he’s had all kinds of people come up to him at the blanket: students from the campus pro-Israel group students from settlements in the West Bank alumni faculty a local imam worried parents of prospective students who had just taken the campus tours that walked by the encampment multiple times a day.

“That was the main goal in setting this up. Like: We’re here to talk to you we’re not a threat to you” he said. “There are people who understand what we’re doing here or may not fully agree but appreciate what’s happening and appreciate that we’re opening up this space.”

Caught in the middle

One of those appreciative students is Stutman-Shaw. She doesn’t feel comfortable being part of the group but said she still agrees with much of what JFCN is doing on campus particularly its work to keep students talking to one another. Those efforts have “made me really proud to go to this school” she said.

At the same time the Jewish involvement in the protest movement has put Stutman-Shaw into a difficult position. JFCN hosts a Shabbat service each week with two options for prayer: a Reform service and a traditional-egalitarian one that uses traditional liturgy but doesn’t divide servicegoers by gender. It’s so popular that it can make it hard for Hillel to field a minyan for its own version of that service several students told me.

But JFCN’s homemade siddur doesn’t sit right with Stutman-Shaw. It has a disclaimer explaining that the word “Yisrael” in prayers doesn’t refer to the country of Israel but to the Jewish people and to the biblical parable in which Jacob wrestles with God. For Stutman-Shaw that’s not how she views her spirituality; when she prays to Yisrael she said she does think of the country and the time she’s spent there.

That means she often finds herself without her preferred mode of prayer; instead she usually attends the Orthodox minyan at Hillel.

“JFCN right now is the best egalitarian service that you can find on campus” she said citing the passion of the students involved. “Part of me feels really happy for that and part of me like that really breaks my heart because I feel like I can’t really be there fully in who I am.”

Stutman-Shaw is attempting to resuscitate the Brown chapter of J Street U which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel pro-peace pro-democracy Americans.” The chapter dissolved in the wake of Oct. 7 because the national organization had failed to call for a ceasefire. She hopes it will be a place where student can both condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza and support the existence of the state.

Still while she endeavors to build her own Jewish space on campus Stutman-Shaw said JFCN has been integral to the success of Brown’s pro-Palestinian movement.

“A lot of Israeli students were leading the protests a lot of Jewish students with connection to Israel” she said. “So they were really trying to emphasize the importance of diverse ideological dialogue.”

Dinners across disagreement

Stutman-Shaw has been attending an event called Dinners in Progress created by two other students who hold differing views on the conflict in the Middle East that seeks to bring groups of the not-likeminded students together to talk about Israel Gaza and the atmosphere on campus.

“For the first time since Oct. 7 I see the SJP president who happens to be Jewish and someone who is from the Gush talking about Israel” Stutman-Shaw said referring to the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a group of settlements in the West Bank. “And that’s so exciting.”

Radziner who is one of the co-founders said the dinners arose from the idea that “it would be great to have a dialogue space that wasn’t controlled by the university that wasn’t run by faculty or adults but run by students for students — not run by an organization like Hillel or even JFCN.”

The office of student life at Brown put him in touch with another student Zoey Fisher and gave them funding to buy dinner which is always a draw for college students.

In the three dinners so far a cohort of 14 Jewish students discussed their personal connections to Israel were able to express frustration with each other and dug deeply into their disagreements.

“It’s very easy for people who feel very strongly about something and want to act on it to get together and take action” Radziner said. “But often that comes at the expense of continued dialogue with people who disagree with you.”

The dinners he said “keep it going.”

‘I’ve had too many bad experiences’

Not everyone feels that the conversation has been quite so welcoming. Rabbi Joshua Bolton the director of the Brown-RISD Hillel critiqued what he saw as students holing up in “ideological fortresses.”

“Wisdom is revealed in places where we know very little where there’s vulnerability” Bolton said. “And so it would strike me that the opportunity before students at Brown is not to build an encampment that keeps everyone of a differing opinion out but really embrace the idea of let us go camping together in the wilderness.”

He blames the Brown faculty in part for building ideological fortresses and setting a bad example for students.

In many ways Hillel has been the target of the worst of the ire from protests. Bolton and the assistant director of the Hillel Molly Goldmeier received death threats several months ago.

“It’s just very hard for me to imagine what I’ve endured” he said “and there not being a major campus revolt on account of it.” he said. The campus he posits would be outraged had the head of the Brown Center for Students of Color received such threats.

“I think that kind of reflects where students are at right now” he added.

Teddy Horowitz a senior said he too feels unwelcome on campus because of his Zionism; he said he’d lost numerous friendships because of his love for Israel and his membership in the campus pro-Israel group Brown Students for Israel.

Horowitz largely agrees with the activists’ demands for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s occupation but is deeply concerned about antisemitism within the movement. He said the Brown SJP chapter had expressed admiration for Hamas and that he’s seen antisemitism rise on campus social media. He also saw no place to mourn Israelis murdered in the Oct. 7 attack because of the dominance of pro-Palestinian activism on campus.

Many of his activist classmates fall into two groups he said. “There are the Jews and students who think Oct. 7 was a victory and there’s the activists who are willing to put up with that” he said. “And I don’t want to deal with either group anymore; I’ve had too many bad experiences.”

Horowitz turned to the campus Hillel and Chabad where he found community with like-minded friends. But he remains discouraged by what he sees as echo chambers on campus.

To combat this he founded a new publication the Brown Jewish Journal. “When the Jewish Journal started one of the editors was an anti-Zionist and I was really suspicious of him at first” Horowitz recounted. But as they began to read and edit each other’s work that changed. “Now I really look forward to talking about Israel-Palestine with him” he said.

Horowitz who spoke to me in the days before protesters and the university struck an agreement to dismantle the encampment said the climate on campus had improved since the weeks after Oct. 7.

“I’m really pleasantly surprised with how well this protest is going” he said of the encampment. “Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that these people might be pretty chill.”

But he still feels “betrayed” by the campus community. “I love the outpouring of empathy for Palestinians — they need it!” he said. “I just wish some of the empathy was directed our way as well.”

A campus less divided than it looks

Every student I spoke to said they think even the groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on Israel actually well mostly agree.

“You’ll find a lot more in common with BSI members and JFCN members than either of them would ever admit” said Stutman-Shaw.

But they did admit it. When I spoke with them both BSI and JFCN members made the same point — that most of them agree on a lot of points including criticism of the Israeli government horror at the deaths of civilians in Gaza and a desire for a ceasefire.

Talking with students from across the campus’s Jewish community the divides largely came down to details — students who want a ceasefire but are uncomfortable with using terms such as “genocide” or “anti-Zionist.” Or students who are reluctant to try to find common ground or engage with students who reacted to Oct. 7 in a way that upset them.

But many of them on all sides are trying to push through their discomfort to understand each other even when it’s difficult.

“Movements are imperfect” Radziner said. “Once you understand that you’re all working towards the same goal with different ways of getting there it lets you start to not overlook but push through the parts that you disagree with or find challenging.”

That’s what Klein the rabbi in the chaplain’s office hopes will define Brown’s protest movement.

“I was really proud that these students were still really in it and trying to make it imperfect for everyone” he said. “Everyone gets to be uncomfortable everyone gets to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why do brown eggs cost more than white eggs? Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmN5anVuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvNi8yNDE1MDcxOC9iZW5nYWxzLXRyZXktcGF0cmlvdHMtZ20tcmVxdWVzdC1uZmzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bengals' Trey Brown turns down Patriots' GM request per report,"It appears the Cincinnati Bengals will keep Trey Brown in the team’s front office for at least one more season.

With the NFL Draft concluding the New England Patriots are now searching for their next top football executive which will effectively be the team’s general manager according to a report from CBS Sports’ Jonathan Jones.

Apparently Brown was in the running for that job but he’s declined a request to interview for the job according to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero.

#Bengals senior personnel executive Trey Brown has declined a request to interview for the #Patriots de facto GM position per source. Brown will remain a top GM candidate in next year’s cycle. — Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) May 6 2024

Brown was previously a scout for New England from 2010-12. He later had stints working with the Philadelphia Eagles (2013-19) the Birmingham Iron (2019) and the Saint Louis BattleHawks (2020) before becoming a scout for the Bengals in 2021.

In 2022 Brown was promoted to senior personnel executive and he’s served in that role ever since. He previously drew interest from the Las Vegas Raiders in their GM search this year."

But with the announcement that F1 will be heading for a night race on the city's streets in 2023 that's all set to change next November.

The 1982 Caesars Palace Grand Prix – the second F1 race to be held in Las Vegas after the 1981 edition – was that year’s season finale with the 75-lap encounter won by Italian driver Michele Alboreto for Tyrell.

The podium that day was completed by McLaren’s John Watson and Ligier’s Eddie Cheever – but all eyes were on the driver who claimed P5 with Williams racer Keke Rosberg sweeping to his first title despite having only taken one race victory that season.

Once Celine Dion ended her 17-year run earlier that year a gargantuan high-resolution video screen was installed across the back wall along with a new sound system and lighting fixtures.

But at his latest show at the venue on Saturday night the country star got everyone’s attention early on with a low-tech trick: an airhorn.

For a moment his cutting-edge concert sounded more like a college basketball game. (In fact the thrilling UNC/Duke Final Four game had ended just minutes before.)

“That’s the kind of night we’re gonna have” he told the audience with a grin.

We’re guessing Urban meant they were in for a loud and lively evening. But it also got us thinking about how his two-hour show was brilliant on both ends of the spectrum – exquisite production paired with small unexpected human moments.

Granted our take might be compromised by having the second-best seats in the house. How do we know? Well it turns out Keith’s special guests – several members of the Backstreet Boys – were sitting directly behind us. We’ll explain in a moment as we break down a few highlights of Urban’s latest stand in Vegas.

A tribute to Adele: Saturday’s show was the last of five performances Urban has given at The Colosseum in the past two weeks and they were all short-notice bookings. Adele was supposed to have her “Weekends With Adele” residency from January to April at the venue but postponed the run just one day before it was set to start.

“We were supposed to start our (latest) residency next month” Urban explained. “But we got a call: 'Hi guys. What are you doing in March? April?' I was really honored that we got a call to come and do some gigs here earlier than anticipated because when Vegas calls you just come running. And when Adele needs help we come running for sure.”

As he had previously done at his concerts on Thursday and Friday Urban then launched into an acoustic cover of Adele’s recent record-breaking ballad “Easy On Me.”

“The first time I heard it I thought ‘This is divinely timed right about now’” he explained.

“…Now we need something to remind us of the need for compassion patience tolerance love and mercy. 'Cause we're just a bunch of human beings on this little blue ball trying to figure s--- out. Do we make mistakes? Yes we're human. Do you need to tweet and post your hatred against me? No!”

A salute to the boys: During the penultimate song of the set – “Wasted Time” – Urban made a spur-of-the-moment change to the lyrics of his 2016 hit. Instead of “We had the Guns on the radio” (a reference to Guns N’ Roses) he sang “Backstreet Boys were on the radio.”

He gestured down the center of the room to a row that contained several said Backstreet Boys and as necks craned around them that appeared to be their cue to head backstage with security. The group is kicking off their latest tour with a run of shows at The Colosseum next weekend.

The cover no one saw coming: As he played one of the biggest songs of the night – his 2002 chart-topper “Somebody Like You” – Urban suddenly took a detour into the concept of “guilty pleasures.” In his case (and everyone’s apparently) it was “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.” Soon he had the whole room doing a call and response with its falsetto hook.

“So tomorrow morning when you’re making your toast and you’re hung over and this song pops into your head?” Urban asked. “You’re welcome.”

The crowd pleasers: Along with “Somebody Like You” the night’s biggest responses came with “Somewhere In My Car” “Days Go By” and the old-soul ballad “Blue Ain’t Your Color” which had more than a few couples slow-dancing in the aisles.

View the current offers here.

Adding an authorized user to your credit card account can be a great way to meet spending requirements accrue more points and even help a novice build their credit history. While it can be highly beneficial there are also risks associated with adding an authorized user — or even being one yourself.

It's important to choose someone who is responsible and able to repay their debts even if they're not legally obligated to do so. That's just the tip of the iceberg so here is everything you need to know about authorized users.

What is an authorized user?

An authorized user is a person who has been added to a primary credit cardholder's account. Authorized users receive cards with their names on them linked to the primary cardholder's account. They're able to use those cards to make purchases just like they would with their own cards.

Benefits of adding authorized users

Adding authorized users can be beneficial to both the primary cardholder and the authorized user for a few reasons:

The authorized user can help meet spending requirements on the primary cardholder's account.

The authorized user can establish a credit history early on.

But perhaps the best reason to add authorized users is the ability to take advantage of various card benefits for authorized users.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

For example you can add up to 10 authorized users for free on the Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard® granting each of them (plus two guests or immediate family members) access to Admirals Club lounges when flying American or its partners.

Meanwhile you can add up to four authorized users for free on the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card extending access to Capital One and Priority Pass lounges for your authorized user and up to two guests.

Additionally having authorized users on your Ultimate Rewards credit card allows you to transfer rewards directly to their loyalty program accounts. This is really great if you have a stash of Ultimate Rewards points you want to transfer to a family member's MileagePlus account. Sharing United miles carries a fee of $7.50 per 500 miles plus a $30 processing fee. But you can transfer Ultimate Rewards points directly into the United MileagePlus account of an authorized user without violating any rules or incurring hefty fees.

While Chase allows household members to transfer Ultimate Rewards points to each other in order to transfer Ultimate Rewards directly into another loyalty account (e.g. United Southwest Hyatt) the other account must be held by an authorized user on your Chase credit card.

The downside of adding authorized users

The downside of adding authorized users is that it may become more difficult to track spending when two people are using the same card. Also the primary cardholder is responsible for all charges to the account. So if your authorized user goes on a spending spree and refuses to cover the charges you'll be on the hook for their purchases.

Making someone an authorized user carries risk. Only add an authorized user you completely trust and be sure to communicate ahead of time about your expectations for repayment.

Who can be an authorized user?

Barring issuer-specific age restrictions anyone can be an authorized user. American Express requires authorized users to be at least 13 years old and have no defaulted accounts with the bank. Discover imposes a minimum age of 15 and U.S. Bank requires authorized users to be at least 16 years old.

Bank of America Capital One Chase Citi and Wells Fargo do not impose age restrictions.

Can I remove an authorized user?

Removing an authorized user is as simple as calling your credit card issuer. Some banks including Citi even let you do it online. Once the user has been removed from the account which is typically done in a matter of minutes the credit card becomes inactive.

However it may take several weeks for the card to no longer be listed as an active account on your authorized user's credit report.

Get the most benefit for adding an authorized user

Some credit cards will provide incentives for adding authorized users to your account. For example the Virgin Atlantic World Elite Mastercard® currently offers 30000 Flying Club bonus miles after spending $1000 or more in purchases within the first 90 days of account opening.

Additionally you can earn up to 15000 Flying Club bonus miles every anniversary after qualifying purchases and up to 5000 Flying Club bonus miles when you add additional cardholders to your account.

The information for the Virgin Atlantic card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Furthermore if you have a credit card that offers a big spending incentive adding an authorized user is a great way to help you meet that requirement. For example spending on your Southwest credit cards counts toward the coveted Companion Pass. Earning 125000 points per year is a little easier when you have a big-spending (and responsible) authorized user to help you get there.

Another way to benefit from having an authorized user on your card is with the The Platinum Card® from American Express. The card carries a flat $195 fee to add each authorized user (see rates and fees). However this includes key benefits like lounge access complimentary Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors Gold elite status and more.

Note that you can add up to five authorized users to the American Express® Gold Card for free (see rates and fees). These authorized users can then earn Membership Rewards points at the same rate as the primary cardholder: 4 points per dollar at restaurants and 4 points per dollar at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25000 in purchases per calendar year then 1 point per dollar).

This is a great way for household members to get many of the best benefits of two rewarding cards.

Related: Why you should add authorized users on your Amex Platinum

How do authorized users affect my credit — and their own?

Adding an authorized user will not impact your credit unless the additional card racks up a large amount of spending and increases your credit utilization ratio. This can be avoided by paying off large balances before the statement closing date.

Meanwhile authorized users can see a positive credit impact by having access to an additional credit line and lowering their own credit utilization ratios. For those building a credit history being an authorized user can be a huge boost.

When I was in high school my sister added me as an authorized user on her Bank of America credit card. By the time my 18th birthday rolled around I had a two-year credit history and got approved for the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express. It worked out well for me and because I didn't use the card for crazy spending sprees my sister's credit wasn't negatively impacted.

It takes responsible people on both sides to mitigate possible negative impacts of adding an authorized user.

Should you open a joint account or add an authorized user?

The difference between a joint account and an authorized user comes down to liability. Joint account holders share liability for charges while authorized users do not. Primary cardholders can also limit the amount of credit an authorized user can utilize. Joint account holders together can access the full credit line.

Being a joint account holder may prevent you from qualifying for your own version of the same card in the future. For example my mom was added as a joint account holder to my dad's Chase Sapphire Preferred Card years ago. When she applied for her own card last year she was denied because Chase viewed her as already having the card. If she had been an authorized user (as opposed to a joint account holder) she would have qualified for her own card.

There isn't much of an upside to joint accounts other than lessening the burden of liability on the primary cardholder. Ideally you shouldn't be adding anyone to your credit card (as an authorized user or joint account holder) unless you trust them to use it responsibly.

Bottom line

Adding an authorized user can be widely beneficial to both parties. However it's important to be aware of the risks as the last thing you want to do is sour a relationship because of one person's financial irresponsibility. Only add an authorized user whom you completely trust to be responsible with your credit line and pay their share of the balance on time.

This week at Frequent Miler

In credit cards

The impetus for this week’s discussion was certainly the public launch of the Bilt card now issued by Wells Fargo and available without a waitlist. In this post I compared the Bilt card against cards like the Sapphire Preferred and Capital One Venture card though on this week’s show we have a far more complete discussion about which card would be best for a young person starting out with a rewards credit card. There’s a lot going for the Bilt card: points in what is likely the most significant spending category for most decent return on dining and travel ability to transfer to a unique and highly useful collection of partners primary rental car coverage and phone insurance all in a card with no annual fee clearly puts the Bilt card in the discussion but is it the one?

Bilt launched to the masses this week and now anyone can earn points for paying rent — even if their landlord doesn’t accept a credit card (Bilt even has a mechanism for paying by ACH). The truth is that this card isn’t a great fit for many of us who are willing to juggle a dozen different cards and a number of annual fees but I think many of us know a few people for whom it would be a good fit. The nice thing is that you can be rewarded for that even if you don’t have the Bilt card. You’ll get 25K points — which you can transfer to Hyatt AA Turkish etc — for every 5 successful referrals to the card. That’s a pretty sweet deal.

If you like baseball you need to check this out: Capital One has cardholder exclusive tickets to baseball games that cost just 5000 miles per ticket and they are awesome seats (in many cases they are seats that ordinarily go for $200-$300 per seat. Think just a couple rows off of the field for 5K miles flat. The confusing thing is that they only have 4 seats per game and when the special cardholder exclusive seats are gone they sell a wide array of normal seats for awful prices. I added screen shots to the post after publication to make it easier to identify the good stuff.

With so many programs changing to dynamic pricing what are the free night certificates worth? Who has the best ones? I think Greg was at least tipping his rocker here if not crashing completely off of it: clearly the Hilton certs are by far the best right? Well that’s true as long as you’re willing to travel to a Hilton where they can be maximized. The truth is that there is a lot of “beauty in the eye of the beholder” here. The best free night certificates are the ones you’ll use to good value before they expire. Now excuse me while I try to clear out this collection of Marriott certs scheduled to expire at the end of June . . . .

The tax man cometh so it’s time for you to collect as many points as you can. Greg has updated the guide to paying your taxes by card because the end is near. I had a goal in mind to have my taxes done as soon as I had all the forms in February but now I’m just shooting for having them done in time to mail a check via Plastiq. Here’s hoping….

In loyalty and awards

Greg highlights a fantastic sweet spot that I’d certainly missed: Virgin Atlantic’s excellent pricing for intra-European flights on Air France and KLM particularly in business class. Like Greg I was hit with some sticker shock on the cost of intra-European travel the last time I was in Europe (what do you mean there are no $5 flights on Ryanair on the day and route when I need them?!?) and like Greg I wasn’t impressed with award pricing via most partners. This is a great one to keep in mind and since I have two potential trips to Europe on the docket for this year it is one that may just come in handy for me.

This is awesome: Delta is going to indefinitely continue awarding elite credit on Delta-operated SkyMiles award tickets. Originally scheduled to be a temporary program change it just makes sense to me for an airline to reward customers for remaining loyal and for redeeming miles in a way that is fairly advantageous for the airline. While I don’t have any extra love for the dynamically priced programs the major US airlines have created I think that Delta and American are hitting the nail on the head in rewarding loyalty in a broader sense than has been traditionally recognized. Kudos to Delta on this — hopefully others will follow suit.

Whoever said that Marriott points might get more valuable when they go dynamic was a downright genius. That guy who said that they would likely be worth something between 0.7c and 1c per point must have been a flat-out savant. Or maybe Marriott made a calculated move to get themselves some positive press for now while setting themselves up to take advantage of its ability to stealthily devalue now that nobody knows how much a property should cost anyway. One or the other is true — but for now it doesn’t much matter. Enjoy the party until the music stops.

Speaking of the music it’s time to play musical chairs with your Marriott reservations. Point pricing has likely changed for your existing reservations so it’s worth checking to see if you can save some points. My limited set of reservations was for properties set to increase substantially but if you had some award stays booked at properties on the margins you might save a bundle by rebooking. Hotel reservations are becoming like Southwest Airlines tickets: you need to set a weekly reminder to check for price drops.

If you want to live happily ever after I guess you’re going to have to go back to 4/1 and re-live Spirit’s everlasting announcement. Leave it to “Free” Spirit to reach into your grave looking for some way to extract more revenue.

My favorite comment was this one from reader Alex: “By the way love the guarantee that you arrive no later than 24 hours after the scheduled arrival time. It does not guarantee where you arrive to. Very AAish!”. And yet here we are chasing Platinum Pro via the shopping portal :-).

On Friday night as the Wizards took on the Mavericks at Capital One Arena the team celebrated Hall of Fame Night presented by Moet & Chandon highlighting the careers and legacies of some of the franchise’s most impactful icons.

The celebration was highlighted by a halftime ceremony that featured appearances from numerous Hall-of-Fame former Bullets and Wizards and others represented by family. The team also recognized a number of local legends that did not play for the team but left an indelible mark on D.C. basketball history. Each walked across the Wizards’ court and stood for a moment of applause before a group photo at center court.

Among those recognized in-person were Hall of Famers Dave Bing Bernard King Spencer Haywood and Rod Thorn. The late great Wes Unseld Sr. was represented by his wife Connie. Elaine Baylor was on-hand for her late husband Elgin an NBA legend and widely regarded as one of the greatest players to ever come out of the D.C. area. John Thompson Morgan Wooten and Lefty Driesell were all represented by their sons – and Dr. E.B. Henderson known as the “Father of Black Basketball” was represented by his grandson Edwin.

“I think it’s special” said Wizards VP of Player Programs John Thompson III after walking the court in honor of his father John Thompson. “It’s special to get the opportunity to bring back all these people. When you see Spencer Haywood Bernard King you see Elgin Baylor’s wife; you see Ms. Connie (Unseld). Everyone that was represented. Then you have the ‘son-of’ crew: me Chuck Drisell and Joe Wooten amongst others. It’s great that the organization is doing this. It meant a lot to a lot of people that were out on that court. I’m glad to be a part of it.”

Bob Dandridge Paul Pierce Chris Webber and Ben Wallace – Wizards alumni who were each inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in September – were each recognized for their accomplishments with tributes that played on the jumbotron throughout the game.

The night also included a special giveaway for the first 7800 fans in attendance each of which received a Wes Unseld Jr. bobblehead. The 7800 bobbleheads honor the 1978 season that saw Unseld’s Bullets bring home its first NBA championship led by his NBA Finals MVP-winning performance.

“Our alumni are great players and better people” said Wizards Senior VP of Marketing Rebecca Winn. “Years after helping build our franchise on the court they continue to give back to the organization and D.C. community sharing their time and stories with fans current players and other members of the organization. Their continued presence within the organization is invaluable. For us it is important to provide opportunities for them to continue to be a part of what we do and for today’s Wizards fans to connect with them as well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8va3NsdHYuY29tLzQ4ODc2MS91a3JhaW5lLWFjY3VzZXMtcnVzc2lhLW9mLW1hc3NhY3JlLWNpdHktc3RyZXduLXdpdGgtYm9kaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ukraine accuses Russia of massacre city strewn with bodies,"BUCHA Ukraine (AP) — Bodies with bound hands close-range gunshot wounds and signs of torture lay scattered in a city on the outskirts of Kyiv after Russian soldiers withdrew from the area. Ukrainian authorities on Sunday accused the departing forces of committing war crimes and leaving behind a “scene from a horror movie.”

As images of the bodies — of people whom residents said were killed indiscriminately — began to emerge from Bucha a slew of European leaders condemned the atrocities and called for tougher sanctions against Moscow.

Associated Press journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various spots around Bucha northwest of the capital. One group of nine all in civilian clothes were scattered around a site that residents said Russian troops used as a base. They appeared to have been killed at close range. At least two had their hands tied behind their backs and one of those was shot in the head; another’s legs were bound.

Ukrainian officials laid the blame for the killings — which they said happened in Bucha and other Kyiv suburbs — squarely at the feet of Russian troops with the president calling them evidence of genocide. But Russia’s Defense Ministry rejected the accusations as “provocation.”

The discoveries followed the Russian retreat from the area around the capital territory that has seen heavy fighting since troops invaded Ukraine from three directions on Feb. 24. Troops who swept in from Belarus to the north spent weeks trying to clear a path to Kyiv but their advance stalled in the face of resolute defense from Ukraine’s forces.

Moscow now says it is focusing its offensive on the country’s east but it also pressed a siege on a city in the north and continued to strike cities elsewhere in a war that has already forced more than 4 million Ukrainians to flee their country and many more to leave their homes.

Russian troops rolled into Bucha in the early days of the invasion and stayed up March 30. With those forces gone residents gave harrowing accounts Sunday saying soldiers shot and killed civilians without any apparent reason.

One resident who refused to give his name fearing for his safety said that Russian troops went building to building and took people out of the basements where they were hiding checking their phones for any evidence of anti-Russian activity and taking them away or shooting them.

Hanna Herega a resident of Bucha said Russian troops shot a neighbor who had gone out to gather wood for heating.

“He went to get some wood when all of a sudden they (Russians) started shooting. They hit him a bit above the heel crushing the bone and he fell down” Herega said. “Then they shot off his left leg completely with the boot. Then they shot him all over (the chest). And another shot went slightly below the temple. It was a controlled shot to the head.”

The AP also saw two bodies that of a man and a woman wrapped in plastic that residents said they had covered and placed in a shaft until a proper funeral could be arranged.

The resident who refused to be identified said the man was killed as he left a home.

“He put his hands up and they shot him” he said.

Oleksiy Arestovych an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said scores of residents were found slain on the streets of the suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel as well as Bucha in what looked like a “scene from a horror movie.”

He alleged that some of the women found dead had been raped before being killed and the Russians then burned the bodies.

“This is genocide” Zelenskyy told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.

But Russia’s Defense Ministry said in a statement that the photos and videos of dead bodies “have been stage managed by the Kyiv regime for the Western media.” It noted that Bucha’s mayor did not mention any abuses a day after Russian troops left.

The ministry charged said “not a single civilian has faced any violent action by the Russian military” in Bucha.

Over the weekend AP journalists witnessed Ukrainian soldiers gingerly removing at least six bodies from a street in Bucha with cables in case the Russians had booby-trapped corpses with explosives before their withdrawal.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko called on other nations to immediately end Russian gas imports saying they were funding the killings.

“Not a penny should go to Russia anymore” Klitschko told the German newspaper Bild. “That’s bloody money used to slaughter people. The gas and oil embargo must come immediately.”

Officials in France Germany Italy Estonia and the U.K. separately condemned what was being described and vowed that Russia would be held accountable.

“This is not a battlefield it’s a crime scene” Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas tweeted.

Authorities said they were documenting evidence to add to their case for prosecuting Russian officials for war crimes.

As Russian forces retreated from the area around the capital they pressed their sieges in other parts of the country. Russia has said it is directing troops to the Donbas in eastern Ukraine where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years.

In that region Mariupol a port on the Sea of Azov that has seen some of the war’s greatest suffering remained cut off. About 100000 civilians — less than a quarter of the prewar population of 430000 — are believed to be trapped there with little or no food water fuel and medicine.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said Sunday that a team sent Saturday to help evacuate residents had yet to reach the city.

Ukrainian authorities said Russia agreed days ago to allow safe passage from the city but similar agreements have broken down repeatedly under continued shelling.

A supermarket parking lot in the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia meanwhile has become the staging ground for helping people who have made it out.

Peycheva Olena who fled the besieged city told Britain’s Sky News she was forced to leave the body of her husband unburied when he was killed in a shooting.

“There was shelling and we tried to drag him away but it was too much we couldn’t do it” explained her daughter Kristina Katrikova.

The mayor of Chernihiv which also has been under attack for weeks said Sunday that relentless Russian shelling has destroyed 70% of the northern city. Like in Mariupol Chernihiv has been cut off from shipments of food and other supplies.

On Sunday morning Russian forces launched missiles on the Black Sea port of Odesa in southern Ukraine sending up clouds of dark smoke that veiled parts of the city. The Russian military said the targets were an oil processing plant and fuel depots around Odesa which is Ukraine’s largest port and home to its navy.

The Odesa city council said Ukraine’s air defense shot down some missiles before they hit the city. Ukrainian military spokesman Vladyslav Nazarov said there were no casualties from the attack.

The regional governor in Kharkiv said Sunday that Russian artillery and tanks performed over 20 strikes on Ukraine’s second-largest city and its outskirts in the country’s northeast over the past day.

The head of Ukraine’s delegation in talks with Russia said Moscow’s negotiators informally agreed to most of a draft proposal discussed during face-to-face talks in Istanbul this week but no written confirmation has been provided.

The Ukrainian negotiator Davyd Arakhamia said on Ukrainian TV that he hoped the proposal was developed enough so Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin could meet to discuss it. But the top Russian negotiator in talks with Ukraine Vladimir Medinksy was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying it was too early to talk about a meeting between the two leaders."

It was a rare tragedy after a fairly safe decade for the country’s aviation sector.

The accident spelled an end to more than 100 million straight hours of safe flying by Chinese carriers which the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in late February was a world record.

All 132 people on board China Eastern Airlines flight MU5735 were killed when the Boeing 737-800 plunged from a cruising altitude into a hillside in southern China on March 21 sending shock waves across the country.

The last fatal accident was over a decade ago in 2010 when 44 people died and 52 were injured after a Henan Airlines plane crashed into the ground when attempting to land in thick fog.

Like other countries China is bound by the Convention on International Civil Aviation also known as the Chicago Convention that sets out standards to ensure safety no matter which nation’s airline is operating a flight. For example it requires the CAAC to release a preliminary investigation report 30 days after an aircraft accident.

The overall accident rate of large commercial aircraft operating in China from 2008 to 2021 was also vastly below the global rate according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) a specialist UN agency.

Last year there were an average of 0.57 accidents worldwide and 0.69 among US planes per million commercial departures on planes heavier than 5.7 tonnes ICAO figures show. There were no incidents involving Chinese commercial aircraft in this category in 2021.

How common are aviation incidents in China?

Accidents and hijackings were much more common in the past.

In the 1980s there were 17 incidents that threatened the safety of commercial passenger flights operated by Chinese carriers according to data from the US-based Flight Safety Foundation. In the 1990s there were 31 incidents with over half of those being hijacks.

But despite more flights operating in China in recent years amid growing demand for air travel only 15 accidents were recorded in the 2000s and only eight occurred in the 2010s.

The rarity of major accidents let alone fatal disasters made the crash of China Eastern flight MU5735 – which killed 123 passengers and nine crew – all the more shocking.

It was the deadliest aviation disaster in China since 1994 when all 160 people on China Northwest Airlines flight WH2303 died when the plane crashed after taking off because of a mechanical failure caused by poor maintenance.

Why did flights in China get safer?

China learned from fatal disasters in the 1990s and early 2000s said Chrystal Zhang an associate professor at RMIT University in Melbourne who studies Chinese aviation policies.

“Definitely the government had realised that safety should be the priority of the operation of the whole industry” she said. “That kind of impact on the society the confidence of people travelling and also the economic development which was the goal of the government at the time was negative.”

Industry conditions also played a part Zhang said. At the time the airline sector was growing exponentially resulting in a shortage of professionals – from pilots and air traffic controllers to mechanics – and training new blood would need time.

In response to both the high-profile air disasters and competition for aviation professionals authorities tightened approvals of new airlines at a time when low-cost carriers were piling into the market.

“In the aviation community people tend to talk about this dilemma that if you focus too much on the profit you perhaps could overlook the safety requirements. That kind of tension always exists” Zhang said.

But the competition for domestic approvals as well as the need to compete with foreign carriers drove Chinese airlines to improve their safety measures she added.

What is China doing differently?

China’s so-called Big Three airlines that dominate the country’s airspace – Air China China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines – are all state-owned.

According to the CAAC 69.3 per cent of transport turnover among Chinese carriers was from the three airline groups in 2019 the year before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. In 2020 they accounted for 68.2 per cent of turnover.

China’s cabinet the State Council oversees the three airlines which Zhang said was good for ensuring operational safety.

Unlike some civil aviation regulators of other countries the CAAC both regulates the aviation market and oversees flight safety.

“That kind of control oversight and management is very well developed” Zhang said also noting that the CAAC’s structure with seven regional administrations made it effective in exercising its regulatory power.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc3VuZGF5Z3VhcmRpYW5saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JvZWluZy1nbG9iYWwtc2NydXRpbnktbWlzaGFwc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing under global scrutiny after mishaps - The Sunday Guardian Live,"Between 2006 and 2021 Boeing 737-800 has met with 11 accidents killing 787 people.

Over 500 people have been killed in the last five years in fatal air accidents across the world involving the “Next Generation” Boeing aircraft bringing the world’s largest manufacturer of aircraft under the serious scrutiny of global aviation watchdogs.

The recent air crash involving the Boeing 737-800 the “Next Generation” aircraft operated by China Eastern Airlines that left 132 passengers and crew on board dead has brought all such 737-800 aircraft operated by different airlines in India under heightened scrutiny by India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

Chinese aviation officials have recovered the two flight recorders or black boxes of the ill-fated Chinese aircraft that crashed on 21 March and are in the process of decoding it to understand the reason for the crash. The first black box of the Boeing 737 aircraft believed to be the cockpit voice recorder was recovered on 23 March while the second was found on 26 March. The 737-800 that was carrying the passengers of flight number MU5735 operated by China Eastern Airlines is one of the Chicago-based aviation company’s safest models when one considers flight-to-crash ratio.

It is totally different from the 737 Max that was at the centre of a major safety related controversy that erupted three years ago in March 2019 when all 387 Max aircraft were grounded following two fatal crashes that were blamed on a fault in the 737 Max’s autopilot software. The software forced the planes into unintended nosedives.

India has 75 Boeing 737-800 aircraft in operation with the largest fleet of this aircraft being used by low-cost carrier SpiceJet. SpiceJet has 36 Boeing 737-800 “Next Generation” aircraft in operation while Vistara has about 14 such aircraft in operation in India. Air India’s low-cost carrier Air India Express has 25 Boeing 737-800 aircrafts in operation. Between 2010 and 2022 two Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by Air India Express had crashed in India killing 170 passengers and crew on board. The latest incident involving the Boeing 737-800 in India was in 2020 when an Air India Express flight from Dubai to Kozhikode overshot the runway during landing and fell into a gorge killing 20 people on board including the pilot and co-pilot and leaving several others injured.

In 2020 alone Boeing’s 737-800 reported four accidents globally which led to hull loss (damage to the aircraft beyond repair). Out of these four accidents involving this aircraft of Boeing two were being operated by Pegasus airlines a low-cost carrier of Turkey and one each by Swift Air of Spain and Air India Express from India according to Boeing’s “Statistical summary of commercial Jet Airplane accident” report released in 2021.

In 2021 no fatal accident or any accident termed to be “substantial” was reported involving the Boeing Next Generation aircraft. It is pertinent to mention that a major part of 2021 witnessed a shutdown/lockdown across the globe due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Boeing 737-800 is a narrow-bodied aircraft that can seat 189 passengers in a single-class configuration and 162 passengers in a two-class configuration. It was first launched in September 1994 and is a stretched version of the 737-700. This variant of Boeing’s “Next Generation” aircraft can fly a maximum distance of 5600 km with a typical cruise speed of 840 km/hr. The world over Boeing has 117 airlines using their 737 series with over 7283 deliveries completed by the company for this variant of the aircraft. This variant is mostly used by low-cost carriers as it provides fuel economy and more passenger seats.

According to Boeing’s own accident report the company’s Next Gen 737 series which includes the 737-600/700/800/900 has reported 21 major accidents since the aircraft’s launch in 1994. Between 2006 and 2021 Boeing’s second most advanced narrow body aircraft the Boeing 737-800 has met with 11 accidents killing 787 people and leaving 271 severely injured.

The Boeing’s 737 Max which is an advanced version of 737-800 and a part of Boeing’s 737 family was launched with much pomp and show by the aircraft manufacturer terming it as the most advanced aircraft both aesthetically as well as technologically. But soon the 737 Max started reporting technical problems. The aircraft was involved in two successive crashes that killed 346 passengers within a span of six months. On 29 October 2018 the Indonesian carrier Lion Air flight 610 crashed. Less than six months later Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed on 10 March 2019 soon after taking off. After this all 387 Max aircraft in service across 59 airlines worldwide were grounded and investigation was launched into the aircraft with Boeing being put to question over “faulty design”. Later Boeing was charged with “fraud” for hiding information from safety regulators. In January 2021 Boeing entered into an agreement with the American Department of Justice (DoJ) to resolve the criminal charge related to a “conspiracy to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration’s Aircraft Evaluation Group (FAA AEG) in connection with the FAA AEG’s evaluation of Boeing’s 737 MAX airplane”.

Under the terms set by the DoJ Boeing was asked to pay a total criminal monetary amount of over $2.5 billion that composed of a criminal monetary penalty of $243.6 million compensation payments to Boeing’s 737 MAX airline customers of $1.77 billion and the establishment of a $500 million crash-victim beneficiaries fund to compensate the heirs relatives and legal beneficiaries of the 346 passengers who died in the Boeing 737 MAX crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. “The misleading statements half-truths and omissions communicated by Boeing employees to the FAA impeded the government’s ability to ensure the safety of the flying public” the statement by DoJ said.

Indian airline SpiceJet currently operates 13 Boeing 737 Max aircraft and according to Boeing the company has an order book of 214 Boeing 737 Max from India’s SpiceJet and its newest client Akasa Air. The Boeing 737 Max grounded in March 2019 was allowed to take to the skies once again by the DGCA through an order dated 26 August 2021 after Boeing had made the necessary changes in its design and the US aviation watchdog Federal Aviation Administration issuing an Airworthiness Directive certificate in November 2020.

This was followed by Boeing’s 737 Max receiving airworthiness certificate from the European Aviation Safety Agency in February 2021. In total over 17 regulators have permitted the operation of Boeing 737 Max as of August 2021.

The Sunday Guardian sent a detailed questionnaire to Boeing seeking details on safety regulation for Boeing’s 737-800 aircraft the steps that the manufacturer has taken for ensuring that the aircraft is safe to operate and whether the company has done any audit to unravel reason/reasons for the multiple air crashes and whether Indian air carriers using these models of Boeing have been re-briefed.

In response to The Sunday Guardian’s questionnaire Boeing said “We extend our deepest condolences for the loss of those on board China Eastern Airlines Flight MU 5735. Our thoughts and prayers are with the passengers and crew their families and all those affected by this accident. Boeing will continue to support our airline customers during this difficult time. In addition a Boeing technical team is supporting the NTSB and the Civil Aviation Administration of China who will lead the investigation.”

Here’s a breakup of the accidents involving deaths of passengers:

1. September 2018-Air Niugini Flight 73 – under shot the runway and landed in a lagoon-1 killed Boeing 737-800; 2. 29 October 2018-Lion Air Flight 610 – Nosedived and crashed 11 minutes after taking off-189 people killed Boeing 737 Max; 3. 10 March 2019-Ethiopian Airlines-Flight 302 Nose-dived and crashed-killed 157 Boeing 737 Max; 4.

Two categories of cell therapies represent different production processes: autologous products use the patient’s own cells and allogeneic products are manufactured using tissue from a healthy donor.

Pharmaceutical Technology spoke with Joe Codamo PhD head of Global Cell Therapy Business Catalent and Jose Cruz director of Vector Manufacturing at Genezen about the challenges of scaling up the production of cell therapies and ensuring capacity is met.

Scaling up to commercial

PharmTech: What are the specific needs for scaling up commercial production of cell therapies?

Codamo (Catalent): Autologous and allogeneic therapies are at various stages of their product lifecycles with some shared and some unique manufacturing needs. The starting material for autologous products can be highly variable given the disease state of the patient. The ‘vein-to-vein’ process lead time is critical so the manufacturing product testing and release timelines should be compatible. For allogeneic therapies the scale-up and generation of a reproducible cell expansion process is key as well as robust formulation and high-throughput fill/finish capacity. Shared needs include implementing a secure robust supply chain that can support the necessary scale throughput and reproducibility needed once a product has been commercialized. The associated cost of goods must be appropriate especially as some may become second- or even first-line treatments.

Cruz (Genezen): There are several challenges that all developers can expect to face when scaling up cell therapies to commercial production. A key need is to manage variability seen in development data that can be magnified upon scale-up. A structured quality-by-design (QbD) development approach fit to transition into commercial manufacturing upon regulatory approval will also need to be implemented. With increasing IND [investigational new drug] applications for novel and innovative cell therapies it is likely that existing processes will not easily fit to new projects. It is therefore essential that critical core technologies are developed in a way to allow quick tailoring to these specialized processes.

Anticipating capacity

PharmTech: Are there specific concerns regarding capacity for cell therapies?

Cruz (Genezen): The upsurge of IND applications in the cell therapy space has led to an increasingly crowded pipeline. Cell manufacturing technologies are typically very specialized as opposed to ‘one-size-fits-all’ resulting in further capacity challenges due to the requirement for highly customized processes.

It is essential that pharmaceutical companies can quickly and thoroughly characterize and release vector technologies. This will enable generation of qualified data that can sustain a candidate through clinical trials as well as supporting the transition into commercial manufacturing. However increasingly crowded pipelines can impede these processes.

With cell therapies using autologous (patient) cells specifically such as CAR [chimeric antigen receptor] therapies we see a need to ensure sufficient physical capacity to manage the different cells for facility processing. This is due to the requirement for isolation and separate cleanrooms when working with patients’ cells for clinical trials.

This work is predominantly manual but there are self-contained systems available; there are moves towards automating transduction and expansion of patient’s cells in the future.

Codamo (Catalent): As the number of cell therapies in the clinical pipeline grows and more reach later-phase studies demand for late-stage and commercial-scale manufacturing is growing correspondingly. This demand will only increase as market acceptance expands and cell therapies are potentially introduced at earlier stages of a patient’s treatment. The CDMO [contract development and manufacturing organization] industry has taken steps to help address the growing demand as evidenced by the significant number of acquisition and expansion announcements in manufacturing capacity made over the past few years. Getting new facilities online staffing with appropriately experienced scientific and technical personnel and having a robust supply chain to meet the markets’ needs are concerns for all advanced therapies including cell-based ones.

PharmTech: What are the steps for ensuring a contract partner has the capacity to manufacture cell therapies to commercial scale?

Codamo (Catalent): When evaluating a potential manufacturing partner it is important to understand what its scale-up strategy is. For example has it designed or optimized its infrastructure to deliver larger-scale and/or higher throughput and is it working with its own supply chain to help assure high-quality production and consistent material quality? CDMOs should have a clear technical transfer and ramp-up strategy to go from clinical to commercial manufacturing. This [strategy] includes a process validation strategy and the supportive studies to demonstrate process and analytical robustness. Finally the CDMO should have a global strategy to prepare for and support commercial launch including topics spanning communication with regulatory authorities to a robust strategy for business continuity (staffing material contingency facility operations etc.).

Cruz (Genezen): One of the biggest concerns highlighted by clients is the need to find a CDMO offering both the roadmap to commercially manufacture cell therapies as well as the technical skill set to solve the inevitable challenges along the way. Selecting a partner with future commercial capacity while demonstrating cross-industry experience in the clinic regulatory and manufacturing sciences is key to successful commercialization but they can be difficult to find.

Once a suitable partner is identified early engagement between developers and the technical team is needed to develop a ‘best-launch’ process with an overarching aim to create a ‘best-in-class’ scope of work.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Willows are ecological heroes when it comes to providing habitat and support for wildlife year round. They help reestablish vegetation especially along riverbanks and flooded or burned areas. And they are a vital source of food for all kinds of wildlife in particular as a host plant for many many types of caterpillars. You may not be the biggest fan of caterpillars but birds are.

Willow trees are classic graceful trees.You may be most familiar with the weeping willow (Salix babylonica) that comes from China but there are many locally native species of willow(Salix sp.) in thePacific Northwest. Exact identification is difficult because their characteristics can be different even on the same plant.

One thing all willows have in common is that they like to grow along streams. Willows develop a dense fibrous root system that searches out water. They grow quickly and root easily even when only a branch is jammed into the ground. The flexible stems of willows bend to shade streams slow floods filter sediment and improve water quality.

Willow leaves are usually long thin and lance-shaped yellow-green on top and white below. The twigs are yellow to green brightening the winter landscape and providing structure and cover for nesting birds especially the goldfinches that prefer willows.

In late winter look for willows’ distinctive catkins. These fur-like “pussy willows” are keeping the reproductive parts of the plant warm. Some birds especially hummingbirds use that fuzzy softness to line their nests.

In any willow thicket one tree may be fully flowered out while its neighbor still has closed buds. That means the blooming season stretches from late February well into April making them critical first-of-the-season nectar sources for bees and other pollinators. The protein-rich insects then provide dinner for songbirds and their babies. Without this early food source queen bumblebees would need to fly longer distances to find nectar using up valuable food reserves.

This time of year blooming willows are among the best places to look for small warblers and other birds. As a boon for birders the relatively short willow thickets make catching a glimpse of songbirds easier than in taller forests.

Come April winds scatter hundreds of tiny willow seeds whose fine hairs help them fly through the air. The seeds germinate quickly even 12-24 hours later. The seeds contain chlorophyll and are raring to photosynthesize—all they need is moisture and light!

Many species of butterflies lay their eggs on the tips of willow leaves where the tiny caterpillars hatch and feed. In fall the caterpillar rolls itself in a leaf and as the leaves wither and curl the caterpillar drops with the leaf. There it stays until spring nestled in the leaf litter which is full of seeds and other overwintering insects—an excellent food source for foraging birds. When willow leaves begin budding again the uneaten caterpillars climb back up the bush and feed on new growth before becoming a chrysalis.

For many wildlife species willows provide food and cover. Wood-boring beetle larvae and other insects love soft willow wood and so do the woodpeckers that search for them. Delicate young willow twigs provide important forage for mammals such as beaver elk and deer during the winter. Watch for signs that beavers have been near! Willows provide a little something for everyone.

LINCOLN Neb. (KLKN) – The Eiseley Branch Library welcomed a surprise guest to their weekly family story time Sunday.

Bruce the Bear from the Mother Bruce series joined families to meet children and distribute honey treats after a special story time and craft activity.

“Story times and other book programs are wonderful opportunities for families to come and read books together” Courtney Schnabel library service associate at the branch said. “Kids hearing stories it helps get them ready to read. If they’re younger even seeing someone read a book to them starts developing those literacy skills. They start learning how books work and how stories work.”

Lincoln Public Libraries usually welcomes character guests to their story times about once a year.

However next month they are planning on a visit from the Very Hungry Caterpillar to learn about caterpillars and butterflies. There’s a even rumor that families might get to take home a cocoon of their own.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZWVodWdnZXIuY29tL211c2hyb29tLWNhbi10YWxrLWxhbmd1YWdlLTUwLXdvcmRzLTUyMjU0MznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mushrooms May Talk to Each Other Using Their Own Fungal Language,"You may not think mushrooms can talk but one scientist claims they communicate with each other using up to 50 words. The study titled ""Language of fungi derived from their electrical spiking activity"" by Andrew Adamatzky who runs the appropriately named Unconventional Computing Laboratory of the University of the West of England has everybody talking.

Some are not taking his research seriously—comedian Jimmy Fallon accused him of ""talking shiitake""—but here at Treehugger we have always been open to conversations with slime mold and trees via the Wood Wide Web.

Adamatzky who previously published research about building a fungal computer and dressing up in living wearables made from slime mold and fungi inserted electrodes into four different kinds of fungi: ghost fungi (Omphalotus nidiformis) Enoki fungi (Flammulina velutipes) split gill fungi (Schizophyllum commune) and caterpillar fungi (Cordyceps militaris).

He observed spikes of electrical activity which is common in all creatures. However the fungi displayed changing patterns of activity that could be interpreted as communication:

""We observed bursts of spiking in the trains of the spike similar to that observed in the central nervous system. While the similarity could be just phenomenological this indicates a possibility that mycelium networks transform information via interaction of spikes and trains of spikes in manner homologous to neurons. First evidence has been obtained that indeed fungi respond to mechanical chemical and optical stimulation by changing pattern of its electrically activity and in many cases modifying characteristics of their spike trains.""

In other words they appear to be responding to what is happening to them and then talking about it.

Much depends on one's definition of ""language."" Adamatzky discusses communication among creatures without a nervous system through hormones pheromones and chemicals. This is not language as humans think of it but trees are talking and we should take what they are saying seriously.

Adamatzky notes ""A modified conception of language of plants is considered to be a pathway towards 'the de-objectification of plants and the recognition of their subjectivity and inherent worth and dignity.'""

So the question is: Are the patterns of long and short electrical spikes actually language? Listening to mushrooms takes patience. The fast-talking spikes take 2.6 minutes and the more languorous ones are 14 minutes long.

The Ents in Fangorn Forest are chatterboxes by comparison. When all the spikes were plotted out Adamatzky compared the patterns of spacing and gaps to those of the English language. He studied the patterns in the spike trains and concluded they are definitely having words among themselves.

The study states ""We recorded extracellular electrical activity of four species of fungi. We found evidences of the spike trains propagating along the mycelium network. We speculated that fungal electrical activity is a manifestation of the information communicated between distant parts of the fungal colonies.""

Looking at the repeating patterns he found that the ""size of fungal lexicon can be up to 50 words; however the core lexicon of most frequently used words does not exceed 15–20 words.""

The different species of fungi spoke different languages with varying degrees of complexity and Adamatzky admits he doesn't understand what they are saying. ""That said we should not expect quick results: we are yet to decipher language of cats and dogs despite living with them for centuries and research into electrical communication of fungi is in its pure infant stage"" writes Adamatzky in the study.

Indeed. In another paper ""Fungal States of Minds"" released at the same time but not yet peer-reviewed Adamatzky and his team of researchers use the same data and go further than asking whether fungi communicate but whether they actually think.

""Fungal organisms can perceive the outer world in a way similar to what animals sense. Does that mean that they have full awareness of their environment and themselves? Is a fungus a conscious entity? In laboratory experiments we found that fungi produce patterns of electrical activity similar to neurons. There are low and high frequency oscillations and convoys of spike trains. The neural-like electrical activity is yet another manifestation of the fungal intelligence.""

At times when reading this paper it seems Adamatzky has been eating too many of certain varieties of his subjects especially when he delves into what it must be like to be immortal as certain fungi apparently are with an intelligence possibly different and greater than our own.

""An immortal or even extremely old consciousness would be able to develop perhaps an intelligence out of reach for us pursuing objectives that might seem unreasonable for our limited perception. Perception of space and time causality are all aspects that we consider our unquestionable bottom line. But given the peculiarity of fungi morphology and degree of connection we may imagine how radically different computational schemes are embedded into a fungal consciousness.""

This all sounds a bit much but admittedly Breyer has been saying much the same thing as a champignon of trees writing:

""They have no need to boast about how great they are they just live their stoic lives and do their work. But meanwhile unbeknownst to most of us the secret lives of trees are wildly deep and complex. They can count and care for each other they recognize their offspring they form bonds like old couples they are aware of their neighbors and give them room they form friendships and remember their experiences.""

Rereading Breyer I am becoming queasy about my promotion of mass timber construction. Reading Adamatzky I am wondering if mushrooms are off the menu. Both force us to reconsider our place in the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHA6Ly93d3cubm9ydGhlc2NhbWJpYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC9lZi0wLXRvcm5hZG8tY29uZmlybWVkLWluLWdvbnphbGV6LW5lYXItY2hlbXN0cmFuZC1yb2FkLWFsb25nLXdpdGgtMTMtb3RoZXJzLWluLXRoZS1yZWdpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EF-0 Tornado Confirmed In Gonzalez Near Chemstrand Road Along With 13 Others In The Region,"EF-0 Tornado Confirmed In Gonzalez Near Chemstrand Road Along With 13 Others In The Region

CLICK IMAGES TO ENLARGE THEM

Downtown is a canvas for Cavs Browns Guardians

All three major league sports teams in Cleveland have real estate development plans for downtown Cleveland. They are some of the grandest visions that have been put out there. And while some of those plans have been made public most remain a secret because they’re still in the process of refining those plans. Some details are unknown because they depend on the resolution of significant infrastructure investments.

The reason for each plan is of course money. But it’s not just money that’s being sought for the pockets of each team’s billionaire owners. The money from each team’s real estate developments will also help to offset and reduce the amount of public financing to be sought for a new or improved stadium arena and ballpark.

But suffice it to say — if each plan is implemented as it appears they could these real estate developments would dramatically alter the face of downtown Cleveland especially from the Cavaliers’ and Browns’ plans for the city’s two waterfronts. And there was news on both of those waterfront plans in this past week.

A rough sketch of a portion of Bedrock Real Estate’s riverfront plans between Huron Road and the Cuyahoga River. Bedrock was founded by Dan Gilbert owner of the of the Cleveland Cavaliers who play at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse seen at right. All of the owners of Cleveland’s sports teams are planning real estate developments next to their sporting venues (DCA).

Cleveland Cavaliers–Dan Gilbert

Earlier this week NEOtrans reported on news that Detroit-based Bedrock Real Estate has a purchase agreement to acquire Sherwin-Williams’ (SHW) soon-to-be-vacated Breen Technology Center 601 Canal Rd. Bedrock was founded by Dan Gilbert majority owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team. It plays at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse a 1994-built arena across Ontario Street from the Cuyahoga River valley.

SHW is relocating its research and development activities to suburban Brecksville at the end of 2024. Sources familiar with the pending transaction say Bedrock would demolish the research facilities and further open up land along the Cuyahoga River to achieve its portion of the city of Cleveland’s Vision for the Valley.

Bedrock’s pending purchase of 9 acres of SHW-owned land would add to the real estate firm’s 20 acres of riverfront land used primarily as surface parking lots. This is the closest riverfront to downtown’s Public Square and to the Cavs’ arena yet is largely undeveloped. Gilbert wants to change that and has changed Bedrock’s leadership to help make it happen. He hired Bedrock CEO Kofi Bonner plus Christopher Noble senior vice president of commercial real estate development and Deb Janik senior vice president of business development.

For a Detroit company the Cleveland connections are ubiquitous. Bonner is a former Cleveland Browns executive. Noble is a former chief of development at two Cleveland-based firms — Forest City Enterprises previous owners of Tower City Center and Stark Enterprises which is reportedly selling its nuCLEus properties in the Gateway District to Bedrock. Prior to January Janik worked for 17 years as senior vice president business growth and development services at the Greater Cleveland Partnership.

While Cleveland’s other sports teams appear to be investing in real estate to support new or renovated sports venues the Cavs’ owner isn’t — at least not in the near term. Gilbert interest in real estate shouldn’t be a surprise. It’s nothing new — he practically owns half of downtown Detroit. In fact his primary source of wealth has been in mortgage companies including Quicken Loans the nation’s largest mortgage lender. His internet-based Rocket Mortgage is growing fast and has a significant office presence in downtown Cleveland; its lease at the Higbee Building is due to run out Dec. 31 2026.

To construct the riverfront vision will require significant construction and modification of infrastructure including new streets sewers public plazas and new or strengthened bulkheads along the edges of the Cuyahoga River (Bedrock).

With more than 1400 jobs locally look for Rocket Mortgage to be a major tenant in whatever and wherever Bedrock builds. Law firm Benesch was also considered. Now that Benesch is moving to Key Tower look for Bedrock to zero in on another growing office tenants and headquarters to add to its downtown tenant mix.

A potential candidate may be steelmaker-shipping giant Cleveland-Cliffs which has a longstanding partnership with Gilbert’s Cavs that only grew more visible in the past week. Cliffs has been rumored to be in the market for a new HQ site despite investing in improved offices for its CEO Lourenco Goncalves at 200 Public Square.

Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse underwent $185 million in renovations in 2019. It should be in good shape for a while but could use further renovations or a possible replacement in another decade or two which is the approximate timeline that Bedrock sketched out for achieving its grand riverfront development vision last fall.

But real estate industry sources are giving mixed messages on whether that’s truly the case. Some say Bedrock’s plans for realizing its riverfront dreams could be achieved sooner. They point to Bedrock’s pending deal with Sherwin-Williams for the Breen property its creation of a new real estate entity called Huron Holdings to which the Tower City parking lot between Huron and Canal roads was transferred last December and its reported plans to rebuild its parking garage below Tower City Center.

But Gilbert is facing an 18-month timeline (from November 2021) just to determine infrastructure costs and to finalize a development agreement with the city. It will be years more before streets and riverside infrastructure can be altered. That’s why others say Gilbert’s first new-construction investment will instead occur up the hill in the heart of the Gateway District on 2.85 acres of land currently owned by Stark Enterprises. Several sources say Bedrock is buying that land a claim denied by Ezra Stark chief operating officer of Stark Enterprises.

Map of several potential development sites that are discussed in the article including the Bedrock riverfront properties the Bedrock Gateway site and the Guardians’ potential ballpark village site (KJP/MyPlaceCuyahoga).

In December Stark directed its law firm Thompson Hine LLP to get certificates of disclosure from the city’s building and housing department for all of its Gateway properties that have structures on them. Stark said the certificates had nothing to do with a pending sale. Normally certificates of disclosure are secured as part of research into properties that are subject to a sale and transfer to a new owner.

When asked about the accuracy of reports that Bedrock was seeking to buy the Stark properties Lora Brand at Bedrock’s PR firm Falls & Co. gave the same answer she gave to NEOtrans when asked about the pending sale of the Breen Technology Center to Bedrock. “If Bedrock has any news on any developments to share we will let you know” she said.

NEOtrans also received information that CBRE was hired to handle Bedrock’s commercial leasing for its Cleveland developments. When NEOtrans sent an e-mail to Keith Brandt managing director of CBRE’s Cleveland office to confirm or deny the accuracy of that information he immediately opened the e-mail but did not answer it.

One year ago sources said Bedrock extended an agreement to retain Cleveland architectural firm Vocon to conduct programming for a new mixed-use development. Bedrock also hired design and engineering firm IBI Group of Toronto to provide construction and engineering services but limited the work to geotechnical and environmental analyses of Bedrock’s riverfront properties. IBI Group staff was to start collecting soil samples from Bedrock’s riverfront properties next to Tower City Center a year ago but that work never happened sources said.

While the information is confusing and contradictory as to where Bedrock will strike first with its first new-construction development in downtown Cleveland there is one thing that the sources agree on — it will be big. Some say it will be as big as Bedrock’s Hudson’s Site in downtown Detroit. That’s a $1 billion 1.4-million-square-foot development whose tower will peak at 48 stories and 685 feet when construction is done next year. Like Detroit’s Cleveland’s will reportedly mix retail parking housing hotel and office uses in the same structure.

Equally intriguing is that Gilbert’s real estate dreams for Cleveland are reportedly being pursued in coordination with the Cavs’ neighbors in the Gateway Sports and Entertainment complex. Why? Because they pretty much have to.

Looking north from Interstate 90 with Ontario Street at the left Progressive Field dominates the foreground with several conceptual unofficial new towers shown in bluish-gray that could be built by Bedrock and HBSE (Ian McDaniel).

Cleveland Guardians–HBSE

Yes the Dolan Family led here by Paul Dolan is the current majority owner of the Cleveland Guardians nee Indians. But that’s probably not going to be the case in a few years. According to published reports David Blitzer and Josh Harris are near to acquiring for about $400 million a 35 percent ownership stake in the Guardians that would also put them on a path to acquire a majority stake from the Dolans in 2026.

Blitzer and Harris are a couple of East Coast billionaires who are partners in Harris-Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE). Multiple sources close to Gilbert’s Bedrock Real Estate and to HBSE say the two groups are coordinating their efforts to deliver a mixed-use complex that activates on a year-round-basis more economic benefits from the sport facilities.

Why does HBSE want to get involved in real estate in Cleveland? For two reasons — that’s what they do in cities where they have majority ownership stakes in sports teams — Philadelphia 76ers basketball the New Jersey Devils hockey plus their minor league teams the Delaware Blue Coats basketball and the Binghamton Devils hockey. Second Major League Baseball is encourage team owners to create ballpark villages around stadiums to diversify revenue sources and provide value-capture financing for stadium improvements and replacements.

A significant attraction to HBSE is the recently approved $435 million renovation package for Progressive Field and a 15-year lease extension for the Guardians that started Jan. 1. There are also two five-year extensions. The city and county agreed to financially support Progressive Field’s renovations and the Gateway Economic Development Corp. of Greater Cleveland extended the Guardians’ lease. Another element in the lease agreement proved attractive as well.

Although set beyond the outfield bleachers at St. Louis’ Busch Stadium the new ballpark village is a year-round destination and includes a high-rise apartment building with every amenity a baseball fan could dream of (OneCardinalWay).

Per that agreement for the next two years the city of Cleveland will make the Gateway East Garage 650 Huron Rd. and its 3.3 acres of land available for the Guardians to purchase for $25 million. In the event the team purchases the Gateway East Garage the city will use the sale proceeds to fund the city’s annual $2 million commitment towards the Public’s Ballpark Contributions and shall assign future naming rights sale proceeds to the team.

Furthermore the lease extension agreement says Gateway agrees to convey or cause to be conveyed the half-acre Gateway Development Parcel at East 9th Street and Bolivar Road to the team in exchange for a $2 million purchase price. Gateway or its transferee will then convey its entire share of the sale proceeds into the Ballpark Improvement Fund.

Combined a 3.8-acre plot of land in the heart of a major-city downtown and next to major-league sports facilities is a large canvas for future development. Demolishing some or all of the 1650-space Gateway East Garage means another parking garage will have to take up the slack for it during demolition and construction of a ballpark village that may or may not include a redesigned parking garage as part of it.

That’s where the partnership with Bedrock would come into play. Sources say construction of a large parking garage will be part of whatever Bedrock has in mind for its Gateway and/or riverfront developments. The added parking would support not only Bedrock’s developments but also a proposed ballpark village and the sporting and entertainment events at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse and Progressive Field.

What might the ballpark village look like? Sources pointed to St. Louis and its ballpark village for a possible glimpse. It features year-round food and entertainment venues hotel and a high-rise apartment building. All of those things could be accommodated on the 3.8-acre plot of land to the north of Progressive Field.

A key to developing the lakefront is to create more seamless pedestrian linkages between downtown and the water’s edge. That means constructing this $230 million land bridge that descends gently from the downtown malls over the railroad tracks and lands next to North Coast Harbor. But since the Shoreway is elevated and rising to the west here the highway is in the way of this progress (AoDK).

Cleveland Browns–Haslam family

For the first time the owners of the Cleveland Browns are starting to talk openly about a new stadium for the football team and possibly for other large events such as concerts professional soccer games and more. And like their basketball and baseball counterparts having new large steady revenue streams coming in from developed lakefront real estate to retire bonds would be preferable to what Buffalo just did in asking the public to pay $850 million for its new $1.4 billion football stadium.

Cleveland has a football-only stadium on its underutilized lakefront because when Art Modell took his football team to Baltimore in 1995 Cleveland Mayor Mike White said he wanted a new Browns team playing before the end of the century. That meant there was only place where a modern football stadium could be built so quickly — where the old municipal stadium stood. All of the water and sewer infrastructure for a 70000-plus-seat stadium was already there.

The new stadium opened in time for the Browns to return to the field in 1999. But not everyone was happy. Many civic leaders from Mayor White’s Planning Director Hunter Morrison to Gateway Sports and Entertainment Corp. Executive Director Tom Chema during the arena’s and ballpark’s early-1990s construction were disappointed that such a large lightly used football stadium was returned to the lakefront to take up so much space.

For the Browns their stadium lease with the city will expire at the end of 2028. By then the stadium will be 30 years old and one of the oldest in the National Football League. That alone isn’t a reason to replace it even though FirstEnergy Stadium does need more than a new coat of paint since its $120 million update in 2014.

Whether the Haslams and Greater Cleveland can afford a new football stadium will depend on many things. One of those things is the fate of the Shoreway highway past the existing lakefront stadium. The reason is that a proposed land bridge over the railroad tracks to connect downtown and the lakefront needs the elevated Shoreway removed or lowered.

This design alternative called Concept D proposes constructing a landbridge across the railroad tracks removing the Shoreway downtown constructing a port access road combining Amtrak and light-rail services in a new station building a new boulevard and extending East 18th Street north to the new boulevard to ease traffic and develop the Campus District (Osborne).

A study now underway by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to determine traffic impacts from several options of redesigning the Shoreway or replacing it with a boulevard through downtown will determine whether funding from ODOT and the Federal Highway Administration can be used and if so which pots of money.

If traffic is slowed down through downtown traditional ODOT and federal dollars can’t be used. However there are new pots of ODOT and federal funds for transportation projects whose goals aren’t for putting more cars through cities at higher speeds. They include ODOT’s Jobs & Commerce Economic Development (JCED) program and the new federal Reconnecting Communities pilot program (Sec. 11509) for removing highways and viaducts that divide cities.

If the Shoreway isn’t removed the lakefront will remain severed from downtown and a less extensive redevelopment of the downtown lakefront will only be possible. Under that scenario a limited amount of revenues from a lakefront development can be generated for the football stadium. That means the lakefront stadium will probably remain where it is albeit renovated.

But if the Shoreway is replaced with a boulevard it could allow the restoration of a street grid and pedestrian connections across buried railroad and transit tracks creating a unified downtown community from the central business district to the water’s edge. More residents workers offices shops and recreation can be added. Under that scenario more lease and tax revenues could be generated to afford removing the existing football stadium and building a new one someplace else.

Two relocation options appear under consideration according to real estate industry sources. One is the Plan B site from the 1990s that was widely favored by almost everyone except the mayor — the former intermodal rail yards. Located on the other side of Interstate 90 from the Gateway complex the site would be easily accessible by highways and all rapid transit lines which share the same tracks below the site. The property is owned by ODOT thus potentially reducing site acquisition costs. The transaction could even be used as ODOT’s share of converting the Shoreway into a boulevard.

The former intermodal yards site on the south side of Interstate 90 from Progressive Field (top-center) could accommodate a football facility the size of FirstEnergy Stadium with room left over for a plaza (shown in green) two parking decks (in black) and a rapid transit station (in red) near downtown Cleveland (KJP/Google).

But the site is constrained from offering much spin-off development. The nearest potential development area is the Flats South District but is mostly on the other side of I-90. Another possibility might be the redevelopment of some or all of the 35-acre main post office property which doesn’t need as much space as it once did. But considering how seldom a football stadium is used perhaps spin-off development isn’t as important unless it can be it own attraction as is the Patriot Place lifestyle center in Foxborough MA.

The other site alternative reportedly in the conversation is the northeast side of downtown north of St. Clair Avenue and in the East 20s. While this would give the Haslams the ability to develop around a new football stadium and expand downtown along Davenport Bluffs there are more than 100 small properties that would have to be acquired.

The site would be accessible from I-90 a proposed new East 18th Street extension to/from the Shoreway and bolster the Campus District’s call for extending the light-rail Waterfront Line as a loop via the east side of downtown to also serve Cleveland State University Tri-C Metro and the growing St. Vincent Hospital. But absent land use regulations and an emphasis on use of the existing Muny Parking lots along the Shoreway it also risks turning the area between downtown and Asiatown into a sea of surface parking lots. Of course that assumes the Browns go the new-stadium route.

“The city and the (Greater) Cleveland Partnership have taken over the waterfront development piece and we have committees working on that” said Dee Haslam in a written statement. “Our part now is how we bring the stadium up to a better standard so I think we’ve started interviewing and thinking about architects and consultants. We’re kind of in that very beginning stage and can start having those conversations and hopefully marry it with the work that the city and partnerships are doing on the waterfront development.”

Developing next to Cleveland’s sporting venues is ultimately about leveraging the attraction and value of those amenities to create new places where people want to enjoy a dynamic urban quality of life (Bialosky).

Timing

While the All-Star Game in Cleveland in mid-February seemed like an opportune occasion for Gilbert to announce his big surprise it was not to be. The last of the certificates of disclosure were gathered for the Gateway properties only one month earlier. When Sherwin-Williams gathered the certificates for its new headquarters west of Public Square three more months passed before it made its HQ site selection official.

It often takes a year for the buyer of a major property acquisition to go through its due diligence including geotechnical analysis. However Stark already gathered geotechnical data for the Gateway properties prior to making construction-ready plans for the shorter nuCLEus. Bedrock was about to conduct similar core drilling for the riverfront properties but told its geotech firm to stand down in April 2021. If a purchase agreement for Stark’s properties was the reason then one would think an announcement from Bedrock is coming soon.

The Guardians’ plans would follow Bedrock’s if for no other reason that a major new parking facility will need to be provided first before the Guardians acquire from the city the Gateway East Garage for possible demolition. Purchasing the parking garage and the development parcel at East 9th and Bolivar would need to occur sometime in the next two years per the new lease with Gateway. The garage’s partial or full demolition would follow to create a ballpark village development site.

The Browns’ decision making depends on the outcome of a federally compliant project development process for redesigning or downgrading the Shoreway as a boulevard. Some answers from that process should come by the end of this year when a locally preferred alternative for a transportation investment is chosen. The Browns will be in a position to decide whether it may pursue a stadium renovation or a new stadium — and where.

Then detailed design and engineering of the transportation improvements for the chosen alternative will be carried out in the following two years along with funding procurement. Assuming all of the construction funding for the Shoreway redesign/removal can be found in a timely manner shovels could start turning dirt for it as early as 2026 — three years before the Browns’ stadium lease runs out.

US private equity giant KKR is paying AEW just less than S$599 million ($441.6 million) for 20 Anson Road in Singapore’s Tanjong Pagar area according to sources familiar with the transaction bringing the Boston-based fund manager’s disposals in the Lion City to nearly $813 million in less than two months.

The deal which was signed during the second half of March and first reported by the Business Times on Friday is KKR’s first real estate acquisition in Singapore and will give the New York-based firm full ownership of the 20-storey property across the road from Alibaba and Perennial Real Estate Holdings’ AXA Tower project.

With regional and global corporations crowding into Singapore’s office market the city-state has already recorded eight major commercial transactions – either closed or in process – worth S$6.78 billion ($5 billion) so far this year which is equal to 80 percent of 2021’s $9 billion total.

A Time to Sell

AEW’s second office divestment so far this year comes after the fund manager agreed to sell 55 Market Street near Raffles Place – around 1.3 kilometres (0.8 miles) from 20 Anson – to a unit of Japanese firm Kajima Corp for S$286.9 million in February.

The selling price for the Tanjong Pagar property which equates to S$2376 per square foot of built area is 16 percent higher than what AEW paid in 2018 when it acquired the 252069 square foot (23418 square metre) building from Singapore-listed CapitaLand Commercial Trust for S$516 million.

The 2009-vintage property still has roughly 86 years remaining on its 99-year leasehold and is zoned for commercial use.

Considering its 27281 square foot site and maximum allowable plot ratio of 10.5 the building’s current GFA can still be expanded by 13.6 percent to reach 286450 square feet based on guidelines issued in the 2019 Master Plan from Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority.

AEW first put the building up for sale in July 2021 and the following month Hong Kong-based Gaw Capital Partners was reported to be in exclusive negotiations with AEW to purchase Twenty Anson for S$588 million. However those talks ultimately failed to result in a sale and the exclusivity period lapsed.

Among the top tenants in the property just a few minutes’ walk from the Tanjong Pagar MRT station are car maker Toyota Motor Asia Pacific global investment giant Blackrock Advisors Singapore and tech firm CSC Technology Singapore.

AEW did not respond to queries at the time of publication while CBRE which is understood to have brokered the deal declined to comment.

KKR Lands in Singapore

While KKR representatives declined to comment on the deal the firm’s head of real estate for Asia Pacific John Pattar is reported to be spending time in Singapore these days while Hong Kong sorts out its borders giving the firm ample opportunity to inspect projects along Anson Road and in other prime locations.

For Pattar and his team the deal to purchase the office tower marks the latest milestone in KKR’s recent expansion of its real estate investment business in Asia Pacific.

Less than two weeks ago the firm announced that it had agreed to pay $2 billion to take over Mitsubishi Corp-UBS Realty a joint venture by Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Corp and Swiss bank UBS Asset Management. MC-UBSR which manages a pair of Tokyo-listed real estate investment trusts with a combined $15 billion in assets under management gives KKR an instant presence in Japan’s real estate fund management universe.

Also this year KKR signed up to back a pair of Australian logistics projects managed by ESR’s Logos division and in December of 2021 had entered a China multi-family residential joint venture with local build-to-rent operator Funlive.

In January of last year KKR finished raising $1.7 billion for its KKR Asia Real Estate Partners fund which pursues opportunistic real estate investments in the region.

Equatorial Heat

With data from Real Capital Analytics showing that the value of commercial real estate acquisitions in Singapore nearly tripled last year to $9 billion the market’s performance so far in 2022 points to still further increases in mainland Asia’s southernmost point.

In February Lendlease Global Commercial REIT signed Singapore’s biggest deal of 2022 so far with its S$2.08-billion purchase of the Jem commercial complex in Jurong East from entities controlled by its sponsor LendLease.

This was followed by CapitaLand Investment and its Japanese partners late last month selling 79 Robinson Road to CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT) and a private fund managed by CapitaLand Investment for S$1.26-billion.

At least part of this investor enthusiasm is driven by a brighter picture for office rents particularly in the city-state’s central business district where leasing rates rose by 2.3 percent in the first quarter to post the market’s fastest growth rate since 2021 according to research by JLL Singapore.

Leasing rates for Grade A offices in Singapore’s CBD averaged S$10.46 per square foot in the first quarter compared to $10.23 in the preceding three months to mark the fourth consecutive quarter of rental growth in the area according to the agency’s figures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xkY29hc3RidWxsZXRpbi5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9nb2xkLWNvYXN0L3BlbnRob3VzZS1pbi1idXJsZWlnaC1oZWFkcy1nbGFzc2hvdXNlLXByb2plY3QtYnktc3B5cmUtZ3JvdXAtc2V0LXRvLXNlbGwtaW4tMjBtLW9mZnBsYW4tZGVhbC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzI0OGJhZDdjMzJkODRkOGNhMTE5OTQ2ZDVkNGI3ZmFl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gold Coast property: Penthouse in Burleigh Heads Glasshouse sells for record $20m price tag in biggest sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast/penthouse-in-burleigh-heads-glasshouse-project-by-spyre-group-set-to-sell-in-20m-offplan-deal/news-story/248bad7c32d84d8ca119946d5d4b7fae on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xkY29hc3RidWxsZXRpbi5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9nb2xkLWNvYXN0L3BlbnRob3VzZS1pbi1idXJsZWlnaC1oZWFkcy1nbGFzc2hvdXNlLXByb2plY3QtYnktc3B5cmUtZ3JvdXAtc2V0LXRvLXNlbGwtaW4tMjBtLW9mZnBsYW4tZGVhbC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzI0OGJhZDdjMzJkODRkOGNhMTE5OTQ2ZDVkNGI3ZmFl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmd0aWFuZGkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2xvZ2lzdGljcy9lc3ItcGdpbS10YWtlLW9uLXNpbmdhcG9yZS1sb2dpc3RpY3MtcmVkZXZlbG9wbWVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ESR PGIM Take on Singapore Logistics Redevelopment,"Logistics giant ESR has joined forces with US fund manager PGIM Real Estate to invest $100 million in developing a build-to-suit warehouse in western Singapore under a sale-and-leaseback agreement with a Japanese beverage maker.

Hong Kong-listed ESR has teamed up with PGIM’s Asia core strategy to acquire the leasehold rights for the property from Pokka Sapporo Food & Beverage with the partners set to develop a sustainable five-storey warehouse on the site incorporating a rooftop solar facility to replace the ready-to-drink coffee and tea producer’s current one-storey building.

“This is an exciting opportunity for ESR as we leverage our unrivalled development expertise to support Pokka’s business needs by creating space that’s designed to achieve energy efficiency and increase productivity” said Jeffrey Shen and Stuart Gibson co-founders and co-CEOs of ESR.

The project is ESR’s first partnership with PGIM Real Estate in Singapore where Shen and Gibson see “excellent market fundamentals and ongoing strong demand for quality assets”.

Leaning Into Leasebacks

As part of the transaction Pokka has committed to a 10-year lease of at least 70 percent of the future building’s 64490 square metres (694165 square feet) of space with an option for further extensions ESR and PGIM said Friday in a release.

Advisors from CBRE which brokered the transaction on behalf of Pokka see the deal as evidence of the benefits to fund managers like ESR and PGIM of teaming up with existing industrial operators for redevelopment projects.

“Investors like sale-and-leaseback redevelopment deals as it allows ultimate ownership of brand-new efficiently designed industrial facilities that are typically backed by long-term leaseback commitments” said Rimon Ambarchi head of industrial and logistics for CBRE Singapore and Southeast Asia. “The high quality of assets that you can achieve via a sale-and-leaseback development opportunity are not often available in the secondary market.”

Construction of the facility at 4 Benoi Crescent will commence this month and is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2024 the partners said.

ESR already has two major projects in Singapore involving a sale-and-leaseback component including a 151810 square metre integrated manufacturing and warehouse facility in the Tuas South area which it took on in 2019 and a 46000 square metre logistics facility at 2 Tanjong Penjuru Crescent which it developed on behalf of CSC Holdings.

Both of these earlier build-to-suit efforts were undertaken by the company’s Logos division before it became part of ESR through its takeover of ARA Asset Management earlier this year.

Sustainability in Focus

The new Pokka project is designed to achieve Platinum certification under Singapore’s BCA Green Mark system for sustainable buildings said Jai Mirpuri head of new economy for ARA Private Funds under ESR.

The fully ramped facility will feature a suite of green features including 2 megawatts of rooftop solar power that can be used by tenants and plugged into the power grid with net metering enabling the facility to achieve carbon-negative status once it becomes operational.

CBRE’s Ambarchi pointed out that Singapore authorities including JTC Corporation which manages the city-state’s industrial masterplan have been making green facilities a top priority.

“In Singapore JTC Corporation is regulating and encouraging new developments to have more sustainable features and it’s really pleasing to see that the industrial development and business community is very much on board with this direction” Ambarchi said.

Nagoya-based Pokka is owned by brewing giant Sapporo and has operations in more than 50 countries across Asia the Middle East and Europe. Pokka’s Singapore unit manages all global markets outside Japan.

“We are excited and look forward to the new facility and office space at 4 Benoi Crescent which will provide us with the expanded scale modern specifications and sustainability features to support our growth and expansion into the future” said Pokka group CEO Rex Macaskill.

Support for Sheds

Benett Theseira PGIM Real Estate’s head of Asia Pacific said the affiliate of US financial giant Prudential remains positive on Singapore’s logistics sector because of its strong fundamentals and stable returns.

“This is a rare opportunity for PGIM Real Estate to acquire a stake in a prime asset anchored by a high-quality tenant” Theseira said. “Our partner ESR brings an extensive track record in managing logistics developments and properties and through our collaboration we are excited that this acquisition and redevelopment project will further extend our regional footprint within the logistics sector.”

PGIM completed $721 million worth of acquisitions in Asia Pacific’s red-hot logistics sector last year part of the firm’s $3 billion in real estate deals in APAC.

The fund manager’s Asian core strategy gained exposure to logistics assets spanning 286704 square metres across Seoul Sydney and Melbourne in 2021 while 230000 square metres of assets were acquired in China and Seoul for the firm’s core-plus and value-add strategies.

Last month PGIM announced a South Korean value-add warehouse investment vehicle with Singapore’s CapitaLand Investment the joint venture having already acquired the Hansol Cold Storage Centre in Gwangju city for KRW 90.2 billion ($74 million) to seed the strategy.",,,

That's why investing comes with a lot of uncertainty and risk. There is however intel that individuals can pull from their own selves to provide insight into how they manage their investments. Dan Egan vice president of behavioral finance and investing at Betterment suggests that there are two general personality traits neuroticism and emotional intelligence that have been linked to specific investing behaviors.

How neuroticism and emotional intelligence play a role in your investments

According to Egan's own research people who self-assess higher in neuroticism generally monitor their portfolios more and are more sensitive to market performance than those who self-assess lower in neuroticism. ""This means they logged in more in general and more in response to large moves up or down in the market"" he explains. When it comes to emotional intelligence Egan cites data reporting that people with higher emotional intelligence tend to invest in lower-cost funds use tax-advantaged accounts and trade less in response to market drops (and just trade less in general). In addition to personality traits there are also certain demographics and characteristics that play a role in one's investment management. According to Betterment customers' login rates the patterns listed below are several Egan shares that on average correlate with an individual's greater likelihood to monitor their account more frequently: Being male (8% higher)

Being younger (3% higher for age 30 and younger)

Having less tenure with Betterment (4% per year)

Having a lower net worth

Having a higher balance

Using Betterment's mobile app Overall however there's variation in how often people look at their portfolios. ""Some people log in daily but most people log in somewhere between once per month and once per week"" Egan says. ""A person will generally monitor their taxable brokerage 'trading' account far more frequently than their retirement accounts.""

Use your personality type to your advantage

There's no ""good"" or ""bad"" personality type when it comes to investing. Rather it's more important to be self-aware of your behaviors so that you can better set yourself up for success. Egan gives the following example for someone low in neuroticism: while they're less sensitive to market movements they might not be monitoring their portfolio enough to catch opportunities for rebalancing (adjusting your investments) or tax-loss harvesting (only paying taxes on your net profit). In this case they could be better off using an automated investment service that monitors their portfolio for them. Robo-advisors are software platforms that use algorithms to create your investment portfolio aiming to maximize your return potential according to your individual risk tolerance and risk capacity. The best robo-advisors offer low-cost diversification and will automatically rebalance your portfolio regularly. Betterment does all this and offers all users a few automated tax tools including tax-loss harvesting where the robo-advisor will automatically sell holdings experiencing a loss to help offset taxes. Wealthfront is another one that offers tax-loss harvesting that can can help offset the advisory fee. And for clients with invested assets of $50000 or more when an investment declines in value Charles Schwab's automatic tax-loss harvesting will help offset the taxes on investment gains. While the above would make a good suggestion for someone low in neuroticism Egan suggests that someone high in neuroticism who is more sensitive to market movements might instead want to use an intermediary to reduce the stress and anxiety from concern about markets. Getting advice from a financial planner in this instance can help to put you at ease. ""The more that you can approach investing in a way that manages and takes into account who you are and how you tend to behave the better the long-term decisions you'll make"" Egan adds.

CVX,Chevron Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNlcnRzdW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9nb2xmLzIwMjIvMDQvMDQvbHBnYS1rdXBjaG8td29uZGVycy13aHktcGVvcGxlLXRhbGstaGVyLW5hdGlvbmFsLXdpbi10aHJlZS15ZWFycy1sYXRlci83MjcwMjAyMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Now a major champion at Chevron Jennifer Kupcho wonders why she is asked about Augusta win three years later,"If you want to know just how damaging the Augusta National Women’s Amateur has been to the desert’s LPGA major championship consider that Chevron Championship winner Jennifer Kupcho was asked several times during the week what it was like to win at Augusta a victory that took place three years ago.

That same week in 2019 Jin Young Ko who is the No. 1 player in women’s golf today was winning at Mission Hills Country Club. But that victory by Kupcho at Augusta National kept coming up again and again at Mission Hills during tournament week.

First Kupcho said she conjured up cool memories and good feelings by watching and listening to the final round of this year’s ANWA before shooting her Saturday 64 to take a six-shot lead in the Chevron. Then the last question for Kupcho in her winner’s press conference Sunday was if she has totally embraced what happened to her at Augusta National three years after her win there and a half hour after winning her first LPGA title in a major championship.

“I'm not sure I've actually embraced it but I think I started to become more okay with it when I started getting closer to winning out here” Kupcho said. “I think that's the biggest thing about it all why was I (always) getting asked about this Augusta three years later. It's like have you not seen what I've been doing out here? I've really wanted to -- not that Augusta is not special but now I'm a major champion. To add that to the list is something I've been wanting for a few years now.”

The comparison between the ANWA and the Chevron is close to the comparison between the U.S. Amateur and the U.S. Open. The top amateurs play in one the best players in the world play in the other. Kupcho has now won both a logical progression in her career. But Augusta National’s standing in the golf world is so towering that Kupcho will likely be asked about Augusta National the rest of her career.

A few other notes from the final week of the Chevron Championship in the desert:

Boo-birds in the desert

Some people in the media were surprised when Al Williams vice president of corporate affairs at Chevron was hit with a fair amount of boos from fans in the grandstand awaiting Kupcho’s leap into Poppie’s Pond. But that reaction seemed completely normal. Chevron is one of the parties involved in taking the tournament to Houston next year and the fans who showed up over the weekend don’t want to see that happen.

In addition it seemed like the cheers for players were bigger this year than they were three or four years ago. Maybe that was because fans were back on the course for the first time since 2019 with the last two years played with no fans because of COVID-19 protocols. Or perhaps the fans were just giving a final tribute to LPGA golfers as the tournament slips away to another state.

Ko’s tough week

Was it the pressure of a major championship the expectations of a win or was it just time for Jin Young Ko to throw in a clunker of a tournament? Whatever the case the No. 1 player in the world did everything opposite of what was expected of her at the Chevron Championship this year.

Riding a streak of 34 consecutive rounds under par on the LPGA Ko failed to break par in three of her four rounds on the Dinah Shore Course. Ko finished tied for 53rd with just one solid round a 4-under 68 in the second round.

Even with the performance Ko has won six of her last 12 LPGA starts so it is easy to think that perhaps it was just one bad week for the player who won the Chevron title in 2019.

Lexi’s farewell to the desert

When people look back at the history of the Chevron Championship in the desert Lexi Thompson will be remembered as one of the handful of players who played well pretty much every year on the Shore Course. She added to that legacy with a tie for fourth at 10-under par four shots behind winner Jennifer Kupcho.

Thompson capped her performance with a long birdie putt prompting loud cheers from the crowd.

Thompson who seemed on the verge of tears as she walked onto the 18th green and then walked off to the cheers won the 2014 tournament but that is one of six top-five performances in the major in the last nine years. One of those was the playoff loss in 2017 when she was hit with four penalty shots because of a rules violation reported by a television viewer.

Thompson readily admits she’ll miss Mission Hills Country Club.

“Mission Hills this is still one of my most favorite venues. Such amazing memories here” Thompson said. “But I know Chevron is going to do amazing things with this event in general so I can't wait to see what Houston will bring. It's definitely unfortunate we're leaving here. Hopefully somebody else will pick up an event here because I think the fans would absolutely love that. They love us being here and we absolutely enjoy it.”

That sentiment that the LPGA needs to come back to the desert in some way was echoed by several players during the week. It would be nice if some official of some corporation perhaps somehow who lives in the desert part time would take the hint call LPGA Commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan and get a conversation started.

When a trade jumps by 250% over the course of days investors typically pop bottles of champagne. Between Friday March 4 and Tuesday March 8 nickel futures did just that — soaring on the London Metal Exchange from about $29000 to $100000 per ton. But the champagne remains corked investors are threatening to sue and the LME is hemorrhaging business.

So how did it happen?

The tale that ensues involves billions of dollars Russia a Chinese tycoon known as “Big Shot” daytime drinking and a metal exchange stuck between two large rocks without a chisel.

A sleeping giant awakens

For the majority of the last decade nickel prices were boring. On the London Metal Exchange the premier trading and price-formation venue for industrial metals nickel traded between $10000 and $20000 per metric ton and moved about $100 each day.

Then in early March a short squeeze of epic proportions prodded by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine awoke the sleeping giant.

One Chinese metals producer Tsingshan Holding Group Co. sat at the center of the storm. The group had wagered a massive bet that the price of nickel would fall. At its peak Tsingshan’s short position was equivalent to about an eighth of all of the outstanding contracts in the market: If prices had stood at $100000 the company would have owed the LME $15 billion according to the Wall Street Journal.

The spike generated margin calls higher than the LME had ever seen — and if paid they would force multiple defaults that would ripple through the exchange and destabilize the global market.

Exchange executives scrambled to respond ultimately throwing a lifeline to the brokers representing Tsingshan and other producers. In an unprecedented move they halted trading and retroactively canceled all 9000 trades that occurred on Tuesday worth about $4 billion in total.

The market would remain dark for a week unleashing a tidal wave of chaos and a mob of angry investors onto the exchange. In its wake threats of lawsuits abound and trust has eroded.

Now the 145 year-old British giant is teetering on the edge of a nickel.

Kicking and screaming into the 21st century

Over the past century-and-a-half the LME known for its ring of red couches and barking brokers has successfully trudged its way through world wars meltdowns and defaults. But nickel the metal used in stainless steel and the lithium-ion battery cells in most electric vehicles might be what finally brings the world’s largest market for base metals contracts to its knees.

“The world’s pricing mechanism for nickel is failing” said Daniel Ghali the director of commodities strategy at TD Securities. “The question is will it continue to fail?”

Others weren’t as diplomatic. “The LME is now very likely going to die a slow self-inflicted death through the loss of confidence in it and its products” tweeted Mark Thompson executive vice-chairman at Tungsten West a mining development company.

The LME functions as a utility for metals producers setting the price at which they sell their goods to various businesses and serving as a way to hedge against downturns in their industry. Other investors see it primarily as a money-making tool a part of a well-balanced portfolio. The exchange needs both parties to function but underlying problems are ready to boil to the surface.

Unlike stock exchanges the LME deals in physically deliverable contracts: There are actual nickel-backing trades that will be delivered. For most of its history that served the miners traders and manufacturers well.

But in recent years the exchange has been pushed to start moving into the 21st century. Until 2012 the LME was owned by its members the same people who traded on the exchange — but then it was sold to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) for $2.2 billion. The new owners raised fees to recuperate some of their investment upsetting the community. Volumes dropped significantly and the chief executive and operating officer left.

So the LME wooed a new class of customer to bring volumes back up: hedge funds and other major financial players.

Big money flooded in. The reform part however didn’t go as well.

“When I joined the LME floor in the late 1970s it was very much a ‘my word is my bond’ type of place” said John Browning the managing director of BANDS Financial who served as a board member of the LME and the chairman of its e-commerce committee between 2002 and 2004. “There were probably as many deals done on the floor as there were in the pub next door.”

Indeed LME traders became famous for some very boozy lunches.

“I have seen the floor in the afternoon and there are those who overdo it” veteran trader Malcolm Freeman recalled to the Financial Times.

But as trading surged so did concern that boozed-up brokers would fumble away investors’ cash.

In 2019 the LME officially banned daytime drinking and required that traders remain sober on the floor. The exchange also issued a code of ethical conduct after it was criticized for hosting a cocktail party at The Playboy Club.

More technical changes were also proposed.

In 2021 LME CEO Matthew Chamberlain attempted to get brokers to agree to clearer reporting on over-the-counter transactions: off-exchange trading that’s done directly between two parties without the supervision of an exchange. This kind of disclosure is common on exchanges but brokers on LME said the reports were too complex and costly and blocked the proposal.

That fatal decision could be what marks the end of the exchange.

Winners and losers

The LME’s lack of transparency allows two or three big names to throw around vast sums of money and “hijack” a relatively illiquid market said Adrian Gardner principal analyst of nickel markets at Wood Mackenzie.

When Tsingshan got caught in its short squeeze it held 30000 tons of its position on the LME another 120000 tons were held in over-the-counter positions with banks like JPMorgan (JPM) BNP Paribas Standard Chartered and United Overseas Bank.

“The LME was ill-informed as to the size of the positions in the market and they didn’t know it was all concentrated in one hand” said Browning. “The LME didn’t know that there was one company sitting on the other side of this with a 150000-ton short.”

Sitting on the other side of the short were hedge funds who had bet that nickel supply would decrease because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (Russia provides about 20% of all top-grade nickel). When the LME decided to retroactively cancel those $4 billion in gains on March 8 it was hedge funds who lost giant sums of money.

Global investment management firm AQR which has $124 billion in assets under management was among those that lost money when trades were canceled.

“The winners were commodity producers and their banks and the losers are the various clients that AQR and other large asset managers represent: firefighters municipal workers and university endowments” said Jordan Brooks principal at AQR Capital Management. AQR is considering legal action against the exchange.

Investors said Brooks “acted in good faith and provided liquidity but the LME just decided to shift their trading gains to commodities producers and their banks.”

Still it’s hard to say that the producers who used margin accounts to borrow money from brokers to short nickel — and now owe billions — are winners.

The LME is a massive enterprise. The equivalent of 3.5 billion tons of metal is traded annually and a global standard for pricing these essential elements is set and moderated by the exchange. If it were to cease operations for an extended period it would likely create a black hole for metals manufacturers and dealers around the world.

Big Shot

Tsingshan is led by metal tycoon Xiang Guangda known in China as “Big Shot.” He began his career making frames for car doors and windows in Eastern China and went on to develop new groundbreaking methods of producing nickel and steel paving the way for Tsingshan to become the world’s largest producer of the metals.

Xiang’s company has invested billions of dollars in extracting from countries with seismic nickel reserves like Indonesia. Last year as prices for nickel began to grow based on an increase in demand and limited availability he began increasing his short.

Some analysts speculated that Xiang wasn’t just looking to short his position but he was also making a risky bet that his reserves would soon flood the market and lower the price of nickel. The choice was particularly risky because Tsingshan doesn’t produce Class 1 nickel the only type of nickel the LME accepts. That means there was no immediate physical delivery path for the company to escape through instead to stay solvent they had to work out a deal with the banks who lent them money

The LME has insisted that their choice to alter the market price on Tuesday was not a bailout for Tsingshan. The exchange also poin ted out that a number of other smaller LME-member brokerages would have also gone bankrupt triggering a crisis that could shock the industry globally.

The canceling of trades isn’t unprecedented but it typically happens when there’s a “fat finger” error or fraud is discovered. In this case the trades were made legitimately and agreed to by both parties. While the LME guidelines technically allow them to cancel the trades analysts and brokers said they had never seen anything like this happen before.

“It’s strange and sad” said Gardner. “It’s not good for the LME or the metal industry. It’s not good for the principle of trading or for the principal of free market economics.”

A spokesperson for the LME said that the coexistence of its physical and financial participants helps ensure deep liquidity and benefit the market as a whole but countered that the market had become disorderly and action needed to be taken.

“It became clear in the early hours of [March 8] that nickel prices on the LME no longer reflected the underlying physical market” the spokesperson said.

The decision to suspend and cancel nickel trades “was taken to preserve the systemic integrity of the market and to prevent disorder.” At all times “we sought to act in the interests of the market as a whole.”

End of an era

A week after trading was suspended Tsingshan announced it had reached a standstill agreement with JPMorgan and that it would be allowed to maintain its short agreement. The company plans to produce 850000 tons of nickel this year.

The LME meanwhile continues to struggle. Trading of nickel resumed on March 16 with a hard limit set at 5% above or below the last closing price. The limit was hit and trading suspended within a minute of opening.

The suspensions continued on as trading remained volatile. Between March 16 and 25 official closing prices were declared “disruption events” six times.

Volume in trading has yet to recover raising questions about the LME’s ability to accurately benchmark the price of the metal. Fewer than 210 contracts were traded in the first hour after the market opened on Tuesday. That’s down about 60% from the 90-day average before the trading halt. Other metals on the LME like copper and aluminum have also seen a decrease in trade volume.

“In terms of the way forward of course the LME board is responsible for understanding the full impact on the market and what actions can be taken” said HKEX CEO Nicolas Aguzin to media after an investor day Tuesday. “I’m sure the board of the LME will take the necessary steps to evaluate what are the lessons learned and how we can continue improving the market structure of the commodities market.”

An LME spokesperson said that beyond instituting price limits the exchange had also improved its visibility and reporting of on-exchange and over-the-counter client positions. “We fully recognize the frustration of some market participants” they said. “We are carefully considering future steps.”

Many traders have lost faith in the exchange and are looking to take their business elsewhere but the question is where.

“There is no alternative at the moment” said Nikhil Shah principal analyst of base metals at CRU Group. “There isn’t another choice out there.”

Some are looking to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Shanghai Futures Exchange instead. But traders need an affiliation with a Chinese entity to trade on the much smaller Shanghai Futures Exchange and differences in currency and language are difficult to overcome. The CME doesn’t currently trade nickel but perhaps it soon will.

“[The LME] did something that was egregious and a betrayal of trust” said Brooks. “I’d be shocked if the strategic plans of other exchanges haven’t changed in the past three weeks.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNlcnRzdW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC8yMDIyLzA0LzAyL2xwZ2EtdmV0ZXJhbi1jaHJpc3RpbmEta2ltLWhhcy1oYXJzaC13b3Jkcy1hdWd1c3RhLW5hdGlvbmFsLW1ham9yLWV2ZW50LWZvcmNlZC1tb3ZlLzcyNTMxMzcwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Veteran Christina Kim has harsh words for Augusta National as LPGA major is forced to move,"Sunday's final round of the Chevron Championship will mark the end of a 51-year relationship between the LPGA and its desert home in the Coachella Valley.

The tournament dripping with history is always the first major championship on the golf calendar and the winner's leap into Poppie's Pond has become a moment that fans remember and players dream of. But starting in 2023 the tournament will move to Houston and likely be played in May.

LPGA veteran Christina Kim has always spoken passionately about causes she believes in and that includes the fate of the desert's LPGA event.

In an interview with The Desert Sun on Friday after missing the cut and therefore playing her final round at the Dinah Shore Tournament Course at Mission Hills Country Club the 38-year-old from San Jose had strong words for the golf power-brokers that she believes didn't do enough to keep the event here.

""It's very bittersweet. This tournament's been very important to me over the years for a lot of reasons and I'm really sad to be leaving"" Kim said. ""I wish that there was more willingness from all parties including the people (making decisions) here to have found a way to make it work so that we could've stayed here.""

New title sponsor Chevron has stepped in to breathe new life into the tournament that has struggled to stay afloat in recent years as ticket sales lagged even before the pandemic and as TV ratings have taken a hit with new competition from the Augusta National Women's Amateur event which is held simultaneously.

Many current players have weighed in on the move with varying levels of vitriol. Some are outraged that the powers that be in women's golf couldn't rally around the iconic event others consider it a frustrating necessity to keep the tournament alive.

Kim is certainly in the first camp.

A 20-year veteran of the LPGA Tour Kim's most pointed criticism was saved for Augusta National. She believes the power players behind the Masters in essence pushed the desert tournament out by creating counterprogramming to the LPGA major that includes the ANWA from Thursday to Saturday.

Whether intentionally or unintentionally the Masters treating the weekend of the Chevron Championship as a de facto preview to the following week's Masters has hurt the LPGA major.

""Truth be told I'm not gonna lie. I'm really upset with Augusta National. Because there's no reason why we couldn't continue to have this tournament be the first major in professional golf"" Kim said. ""And I think it's absolutely disgusting what they're doing and I have no problem saying that. It's bull hockey what they're doing.""

Even the way ANWA is run where the amateurs are allowed one practice round at Augusta but then have to qualify to play a competitive round on the fabled course irks Kim.

""It barely qualifies as the bare minimum of allowing those girls one practice round and giving them a playoff to see who's going to make the cut into the final round at that place"" she said.

Kim said she appreciates Chevron stepping in with sponsorship and wanting to elevate the tournament but before it got to that point she would've liked to see a more concerted effort by everyone involved to give more consideration to the history of this event and its ties to its California home.

Changing the weekend it is played to earlier in the calendar is an option she would've been in favor of but finding the right TV window was an issue as were potential scheduling conflicts at Mission Hills.

""I know there were attempts made to try and see if the date could change because Augusta was doing what Augusta does"" she said. ""But it did not work for the region here either so unfortunately it would be easy to say there's no one to blame other than Augusta National but that's neither here nor there. Everyone could have worked ... I'm sure everyone did everything they think that they could've done to keep the tournament here. But the reality is we're not coming back.""

After a slight pause Kim added ""For now at least.""

Kim who has three career LPGA wins and two top-10 finishes at this tournament said you never know what could happen three or five years down the road.

""Maybe a big corporation will step up and see — like the American Express did for the men — that the women belong here in the desert"" Kim said. ""The golf here is incredible the people here are amazing the culture here is fun it's artsy it's inclusive it's diverse and it fits right in with the ethos of the LPGA so there's no reason why they shouldn't have a tournament here. It's just very bittersweet.

""The foundation has already been established. The people. The ones that really matter. The heart and soul of the LPGA coming to the desert are the fans. One can always hope that something can come out of this.""

Kim wanted to make one last clarification before the interview was over.

""I have no problem saying all that on the record. You can tell because I said 'Bull hockey' instead of what I really wanted to say.""

Paradise Drive. The 171000-square-foot facility featured eight departments a lumber yard and the Packers Jerry Kramer was featured as a guest at the store opening.

Now 21 years later the store is reportedly small by today’s standards. On Wednesday April 6 2022 the Plan Commission will address a proposal for a 12500-square-foot expansion. The conundrum is the site is pretty landlocked.

The expansion of Menards would be to the west of the current building as there’s a request to combine two lots and then shift the park and ride over to the northwest of 2180 S. Main Street which is the address for Meijer.

(KOLN) - Lincoln Fire and Rescue responded to a fire at New Covenant Community Church on Saturday.

According to LFR a call for smoke showing from the church came in just before 3 a.m. When crews arrived they reported fire into the roof.

LFR said a lightning strike is suspected but not confirmed to be the cause of the fire.

According to the fire inspector’s initial estimate the fire caused $1.5 million in damage to the building with a large amount of the damage up in-between the roof and the ceiling.

A spokesperson for the church said on social media that the church will hold a gathering on Sunday in the front parking lot at 10:30 a.m. for worship and prayer. Any additional service and programming has been cancelled. The spokesperson also asked that people avoid going inside the church for the time being due to multiple hazards.

Representatives of the church have already met with insurance and a crew is on site to begin clean-up and restoration.

This incident is still under investigation. Stay connected to 1011now.com for the latest updates.

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

Jumat 01 April 2022.

Disaksikan tamu undangan peresmian Pesantren sekaligus gedung Dakwah CQC dilakukan dengan memukul kentungan juga dimeriahkan oleh penampilan Rampak Bedug Ciwasiat Banten.

Ahmad Zubaidi menyampaikan saat ini umat Islam mengalami kemunduran. Para ulama telah mendiskusikan ini dengan pertanyaan kenapa orang Islam itu mundur dan umat lain itu maju. “Kesimpulannya ternyata umat Islam meninggalkan Al-Quran. Dan umat yang bukan Islam justru yang mengamalkan ajaran Al-Quran” ujar Kiai Zubaidi dalam taujihnya.

Berbeda dengan bangsa Barat lanjut Zubaidi yang justru mengamalkan ajaran dalam Al-Quran terlihat mereka melakukan penelitian dengan sunguh-sungguh. Bagaimana mereka membangun peradaban bagaimana mereka mempratikkan kebersihan dan sebagainya. “Umat Islam mengabaikan Al-Quran. Soal kebersihan saja sudah sangat kelihatan” tegasnya.

Dia menuturkan saat bangsa Barat sibuk dengan menciptakan teknologi yang modern. Umat Islam masih asik dengan perbedaan pendapatnya yang diiringi dengan perselisihan.

“Ini sangat memiriskan hati kita. Umat Islam kalau ingin mendapatkan masa keemasannya untuk memimpin dunia maka tidak lain harus kembali mengamalkan ajaran Al-Quran” tegasnya.

Itulah kenapa pesantren Al-Quran itu penting. Hal lain yang membanggakan dari pesantren Quran yakni belajar Islam secara komprensif pula. Selain itu Ia turut merasa senang sebab kini pesantren mengajarkan nilai-nilai kebangsaan. “Insyallah akan menghadirkan peserta didik yang mumpuni dalam bidang agama keduniaan dan urusan bangsa. Santri ini akan memperkokoh keberadaan Indonesia” tukasnya.

Pesantren CQC merupakan pusat pendidikan untuk melahirkan da’i-da’i Quran yang akan menghantarkan hidayah Al-Quran ke seluruh penjuru Indonesia. Lembaga ini dipelopori Ustadz Fatih Karim.

The 2022 season is special because it’ll be the first time since 2019 that every stadium is open at full capacity for Opening Day. Baseball is at its best when there’s a full stadium of fans to enjoy it. So it’s as good a time as ever to break out our For The Win MLB stadium rankings.

“I thought honestly that was the best my stuff has felt so that was good to have” Webb said after pitching into the fifth inning at the Giants’ minor league complex. “All of the things we were working on were really good today.”

Webb could have been facing against the Dodgers with the big league team over in Glendale. But in a bit of spring gamesmanship the Giants sent him over to Papago Park instead where the audience was more dozens than thousands. Webb said he understood the logic.

“I’m gonna face those guys enough this year” Webb said. “It was more like ‘Let’s save it just save it for the year’ and I get that.”

In the outing against the Angels’ High-A team Webb went 4.1 innings and gave up one run (a solo homer to lead off the fifth) on three hits. He walked three and struck out seven.

By Michael Ott Chief Sustainability Officer

Earth Month is a time when we can individually and collectively reflect on our impacts and how we can lighten our footprint. But April can’t be the only time the environment is a priority for us. At Clorox we’ve embedded environmental social and governance goals or ESG into our IGNITE strategy and our businesses. It’s also a critical way we bring our corporate purpose — we champion people to be well and thrive every single day — to life.

We’ve made many strides in ESG over the years. We began measuring our greenhouse gas emissions energy water and waste in 2007. In 2009 we began focusing on transparency and were the first major consumer packaged goods company to voluntarily disclose ingredients in cleaning disinfecting and laundry products in the U.S. and Canada. And last fall we committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We continue to raise the bar and influence our industry to do the same.

We recently refreshed our ESG ambition and pillars to make sure we’re clear about where we’re headed and focused on where we can have the greatest impact. Our ambition is to contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive world through every person and every brand. While aspirational we believe this North Star capitalizes on the potential we have as a CPG company with products in nine out of 10 U.S. homes. Our three pillars — Healthy Lives Clean World and Thriving Communities — are all underpinned by strong governance practices and describe where we are uniquely suited to be a positive force for change.

Healthy Lives: We’re committed to supporting employees’ physical mental and financial well-being. We’re also focused on product stewardship through efforts such as ingredient management and transparency. And we support consumer health and well-being through our wellness products. Learn more.

Clean World: Our priorities are taking climate action (such as our net zero commitment) and reducing plastic and other waste (through goals such as reducing our use of virgin plastic and fiber in packaging by 50% by 2030). Learn more.

Thriving Communities: We strive to create a more equitable workplace through our commitment to inclusion and diversity professional development responsible and sustainable sourcing and community impact. Learn more.

In the year-ago quarter net sales increased 27% equating to an increase of 19% on a two-year stack basis. The decline in net sales reflects a 10-point decline in volume and two points of favorable price mix.

Year-to-date net cash provided by operations declined 65% to $222 million compared to $629 million in the year-ago period.

Net sales declined 21% in the health and wellness category for cleaning professional products vitamins and minerals/supplements. The decline was primarily driven by an 18 point-decline in volume from lower shipments in cleaning and professional products and 3 points of unfavorable price mix. On a two-year stack basis net sales grew 21%.

Cleaning sales decreased double digits primarily due to lapping significant demand in the year-ago period related to COVID-19 impacts. Sales were also impacted by unfavorable price mix as assortment and the promotional environment continued to normalize.

Professional Products sales decreased double digits primarily due to lower shipments of Clorox Total 360 as the business lapped peak COVID-driven demand.

Vitamins minerals and supplements sales decreased primarily due to lower shipments of noncore brands. Segment pretax earnings declined 77% primarily due to lower net sales higher manufacturing and logistics and commodity costs partially offset by lower advertising costs.

New Innovations A Stronger More Resilient Company

Clorox launched new innovations that support consumer well-being and the company's ESG commitments. New Clorox Disinfecting Mists make it easier to disinfect hard and soft surfaces while also providing reusable sprayers and refills that help send less waste to landfill. Additionally the new Clorox Multi-Purpose Cleaner concentrate packaging uses 80% less plastic than a typical 16-ounce bottle. Tapping into scent trends the company introduced Glad ForceFlexPlus Cherry Blossom.

In speaking of the year ahead CEO Linda Rendle acknowledged cost pressures but noted the actions being taken to strengthen its competitive position.

""In the face of a challenging cost environment we're executing well on the factors we control” said CEO Linda Rendle. “We're driving cost savings and pricing to mitigate inflationary headwinds while also continuing to meet strong demand across our portfolio. And we're keeping an eye on the long-term by investing in innovation our brands and strategic digital capabilities.

For instance there is a concern that a previous government might have engaged in the wrong hedging transaction which if true would have magnified rather than mitigated Jamaica’s financial risk.

Further public statements by opposing political interests on whether we have obtained value for the premium paid to procure the hedge indicate that the Government’s objective as a hedger is conflated with that of a speculator in the oil market. The purpose of this article is to provide clarity to the ongoing debate.

Hedging is a technical term for managing risk. In the current situation the Government wishes to maintain a relatively low at-the-pump price of gas in periods of high global oil prices. Consequently it hedges to reduce or eliminate the risk of paying too high a price for oil that it intends to purchase within a given future period.

The Government could hedge by engaging in an appropriate derivatives-based transaction with a counterparty like Citibank or an established exchange such as the CME Group. Derivative securities are so called because they derive their values from the price of an underlying asset in this case oil or the level of an index interest rate or other measurable outcomes. Various derivatives including options forwards and futures may be utilised in hedging oil price risk. They differ from each other in their implications for Government’s financial liquidity settlement risk and flexibility in crafting the desired hedging contract.

HEDGING WITH CALL OPTIONS

The Government could hedge by purchasing call options on crude oil. Upon purchasing the call options the Government obtains the right but not an obligation to buy oil at a price that it determines at the time of contracting (strike price) and the oil can be bought at the strike price up to some given point in the future (expiration date). For this right the Government pays the counterparty a fee (option premium). Purchasing call options guarantees the Government a maximum price at which oil can be bought during the life and up to the expiration date of the options even if oil price increases significantly during that period.

Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters.

Assume that oil is currently priced at US$40 per barrel and the Government forecasts that if price exceeds US$60 and remains elevated it could have significant negative consequences for the Budget and consumers. Suppose the Government purchases the call options giving it the right to buy oil at any point over the life of the option at a strike price of US$55 per barrel. Assume that for this right the counterparty charges the Government a premium of US$5 per barrel. While the Government pays that premium immediately it does not have an obligation only a right to purchase oil at $55. Hence if oil remains below US$55 over the life of the option say at US$48 the Government does not exercise that right to buy oil at US$55.

Instead the Government would buy oil for US$48 on the spot market. The effective cost of oil to the Government would be the spot price of US$48 plus the option premium of US$5 a total of US$53. Given the Government’s concern about price exceeding US$60 per barrel this would be a favorable outcome.

Now suppose that oil price jumps to US$90 and is expected to remain elevated for an extended period of time. If it had not hedged the Government would have had to buy oil at the budget-busting price of US$90 or higher. However since the Government procured the right to purchase oil at a strike price of US$55 it would exercise that right as oil price exceeds the strike price. The effective price of oil to the Government would then be US$55 plus the premium of US$5 a total of US$60. Hence by spending the premium of US$5 the Government has guaranteed itself a maximum price of US$60 per barrel for oil.

JAMAICA’S OIL PRICE RISK

Purchasing put options would confer the right to sell oil in the future at a strike price that is set at the time of contracting. This contract would be appropriate for an oil supplier that intends to sell oil in the future and wishes to lock in the minimum price it would obtain when the sale is made in the future even if oil price falls significantly in the spot oil market.

For the Jamaican Government to satisfy its demand for oil at a reasonable price it needs to purchase call not put options. Purchasing put options is inconsistent with risk management as it does not provide any protection from an upswing in global oil price. In fact in this scenario purchasing put options would exacerbate the oil price risk as the Government could lose the entire put premium and obtain no protection if oil price increased above the strike price of the put option. If pursued by design and not in error then a put strategy would be purely speculative.

Any entity tasked with procuring oil in the future would purchase puts only if it has a strong belief that oil price will fall in the future and it wishes to generate income from the purchased derivative. While it is perfectly fine for the Government to speculate for oil on our behalf it is my strong opinion that speculating in the oil derivatives market is not the business of governments.

NOT DRIVEN BY PROFIT MOTIVE

Risk management is in its essence a ‘cost centre’ and is not to be perceived as a profit-generating activity. While I have not been privy to all the discussions and have not read all articles pertaining to oil price hedging in Jamaica some public discussions create the impression that the expenditure of the premium to hedge should generate a profit. This is unfortunate and appears to be the core cause of the confusion in the current debate.

The “profit” from paying the call option premium is the package of benefits that it confers on the Government. The direct benefits are a) the advance knowledge of the maximum price that the Government could pay for oil over the duration of the option contract regardless of future oil price behaviour in the spot market;; and b) the right to benefit from lower oil price if oil price declines in the spot market before the option expires.

These features of the call option in turn imply that the Government can more efficiently plan and manage the expenditure side of the Budget set targets for a primary surplus forecast oil-induced inflation estimate debt-payment capacity and negotiate loan terms as its oil-related revenue risk is lower. It is worth highlighting that these benefits are not conditional on the eventual outturn of oil price but instead accrue to the option buyer immediately upon purchase. Therefore characterising the success of the call options strategy on the basis of whether oil price eventually increased above the option’s strike price is either deliberately misleading or betrays a misunderstanding of the essence of risk management.

SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT HEDGE?

Successive governments have shown themselves unwilling to embrace oil price hedging. This is not surprising as there are clearly costs to hedging. The decision to pay out a substantial option premium at the time of the initiation of the option contract diminishes the Government’s liquidity and hence its financial flexibility as well as creates significant opportunity costs as those funds are no longer available to be deployed to alternative high-value-added projects. Moreover as is currently evident in Jamaica paying the option premium could create a political liability if for example voters are led to believe that if the spot market oil price does not exceed the call option’s strike price during the life of the option then the hedging strategy was not beneficial to Jamaica.

So should the Government hedge oil price risk? This question is in sympathy with a long-standing question in financial economics: Should firms hedge? I believe it is fair to say that the preponderance of academic evidence now supports the view that hedging generates a net benefit. It is more likely than not that for some hedgeable risks government hedging creates a net social benefit.

Notwithstanding the aforesaid whether the Government should fully hedge oil price risk is neither unambiguous nor a trivial question. That is in some circumstances it may be optimal for partial hedging where the government hedges only a portion of the total projected consumption of oil or fully hedges in some periods and not in others. If oil price declines subsequent to a decision to partially hedge then the partial hedge results in lower costs relative to full hedging but be aware that partial hedging leaves the hedger with significant exposure to the subject risk.

Chennai: Bengaluru-based EV maker Ather Energy has said that regulators need to raise mandatory safety standards for electric two-wheelers to make the battery-run vehicles safer on the road.This came following fire accidents involving e-scooters which has sparked alarm among users. The company said that the ""stringent"" AIS 156 now imposed needs to be augmented for safer EVs.""At Ather we have adopted more stringent internal standards to ensure safety and reliability of our scooters and have thoroughly tested them for 100000 kilometres.

Power regulator Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has revised the maximum power price on power exchanges to Rs 12 per unit from Rs 20 a unit keeping in view desperate buying by state electricity distribution companies to meet demand.The intervention taken after 13 years has been made in consumer interest and reduces chances of profiteering by power generating companies sources said. The Union power ministry in a communication to CERC on March 26 expressed its concerns on high exchange prices.The commission in its order said buy bids on power exchanges have been more than double of the sell bids indicating higher demand and lower supply. The aggressive bidding in a desperate scenario by buyers is leading to high prices. On March 25 the average spot power prices were over Rs 18.7 per unit while the maximum price has been frequently touching the ceiling of Rs 20 per unit.Based on feedback from the country’s grid authority POSOCO  CERC said it is expected that this kind of demand-supply position is likely to persist for some more time with continuous increase in demand as summer intensifies and increase in supply not forthcoming until May when wind and hydro based generation are expected to come on stream.“In view of the fact that higher price has not led to commensurate increase in supply and such position is likely to remain for some time in coming days due to supply constraints and in view of the fact that 99% of the supply bids (for the days for which data has been analysed) have been in the range of Rs.12/kWh and only 1% of the supply bids have been higher than Rs.12/kWh the Commission in exercise of powers under Regulation 51 (1) of PMR 2021 directs the power exchanges until further orders to re-design with immediate effect the bidding software in such a way that members can submit their bids in the price range of Rs.0/kWh to Rs.12/kWh for DAM (day ahead market) and RTM (Real Time Market)” the order issued late on Friday in a suo-moto case said.Electricity demand has been increasing substantially in the month of March and touched 199 GW on March 17 and last week. Since then it has been hovering around 195 GW.Against this increase in demand on March 25 58719 MW of installed generation capacity was on outage due to various reasons wherein 4323 MW of thermal capacity was on outage due to coal shortage. The country also recorded a peak shortage of 4060 Mw on March 25 after many years.High price of imported coal is leading to high variable charge for imported coal-based plants. Similarly due to an increase in the international price of gas the existing gas-based plants are not able to sell in the market. Data available with the Central Electricity Authority showed that coal stock at power stations stands at 38% of the normative requirement and 78 plants had critical coal stocks on Thursday.The order said that this price moderation will be in keeping with the present market realities and shall not have any significant impact on the volume transacted and safeguard the consumer interests.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvcGV0cm9sLWRpZXNlbC1wcmljZXMtc2VlLTExdGgtaGlrZS1pbi0xMy1kYXlzLXRvdGFsLWluY3JlYXNlLW5vdy1zdGFuZHMtYXQtcnMtOC1wZXItbGl0cmUvdmlkZW9zaG93LzkwNjE4NzY5LmNtc9IBqAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvcGV0cm9sLWRpZXNlbC1wcmljZXMtc2VlLTExdGgtaGlrZS1pbi0xMy1kYXlzLXRvdGFsLWluY3JlYXNlLW5vdy1zdGFuZHMtYXQtcnMtOC1wZXItbGl0cmUvYW1wX3ZpZGVvc2hvdy85MDYxODc2OS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Petrol diesel prices see 11th hike in 13 days; total increase now stands at Rs 8 per litre,Fuel prices continue to rise with petrol and diesel rates rising by another 80 paise per litre each on Sunday taking the total increase in rates in less than two weeks to Rs 8 per litre.

Yet people still drink it for many reasons the number one being that it tastes good! Soda drinkers therefore turn to the diet version to slice the sugar content and still enjoy a flavorful fizzy beverage while hanging out with friends. Whether diet soda is good for you or not is not something we will cover in this article. If you're looking for some information on that we've got it here and here. What we will uncover in this article is which is the best tasting diet bubbly.

We tasted 9 popular diet sodas in a blind taste test and were surprised by the results. Two fans of diet soda and one self-proclaimed diet soda-hater tasted the popular diet varieties from Pepsi Coca-Cola Dr Pepper and newcomer Zevia.

Read on for our experience and to see if your favorite diet soda won over our testers. Cheers! Plus here are the 29 Most Popular Diet Sodas—Ranked for Nutrition.

Zevia Cherry Cola

This clear alternative to traditional diet soda sweetened with stevia could not keep up with the other sodas. While it is refreshing that it does not contain caramel color a potential carcinogen this drink came in last. Tasters noticed a ""fake cherry smell"" and an overall lack of flavor. The lack of bubbles couldn't carry the muted flavor through.

Diet Pepsi

6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Did you know that no-calorie Pepsi came out in 1964? Tasters were surprised that this perennial favorite came in so close to the bottom and even ranked under Zevia's diet cola. The lack of aroma didn't bode well for this popular beverage. Tasters noted a metallic flavor or a complete lack of flavor from Diet Pepsi.

Zevia Cola

While Zevia cola got a higher rating than Diet Pepsi notes suggest it did not fare much better. It also had no discernable aroma but also had an ""awful flavor"" and a ""syrupy aftertaste"" that Diet Pepsi didn't have. Again we wanted to like these clear drinks for the health benefits but they fell flat against the others. Guess it's not time to bring back Crystal Pepsi after all …

15 Discontinued Sodas You'll Never See Again

Diet Coke

It feels like Diet Coke has been around since the dawn of time but it really debuted in 1982. Our oldest taster a self-proclaimed diet soda-lover gave Diet Coke high marks calling it pleasing and not too sweet. But she was the only one. The other tasters found it distinctively medicinal and noticed a cloying aftertaste.

This Is the Biggest Mistake Coca-Cola Has Ever Made

Coke Zero

Coke Zero Sugar aims to create the iconic flavor of real Coca~Cola without any calories. Does it succeed? Coke Zero Sugar landed smack dab in the middle of the list. Our Diet Coke-lover surprisingly wasn't a fan of Coke Zero but the other two tasters preferred it noting cinnamon undertones and a nice balance of bubbles and syrup. If you are a Coca~Cola fan give this one a try!

Diet Wild Cherry Pepsi

Tasters described this soda as balanced with a nice mouthfeel and vanilla notes noting that it got better as they kept drinking it. No one noticed a distinct cherry aroma or flavor from the beverage but one thought it tasted more like a regular cola than the others.

Diet Dr Pepper

The Dr Pepper products were the ones that tasted and smelled the most of cherries. Sweet caramelly and vanilla were words thrown around to describe the taste of this thick and syrupy offering. One taster thought the traditional Diet Dr Pepper was too syrupy with a fake cherry flavor. Our Diet Coke fan loved this soda giving it a 10 out of 10.

No Dr Pepper Wasn't Actually Created by a Doctor

Dr Pepper Zero

Squeaking in just above its cousin Dr Pepper Zero won over the diet soda-hater who called it ""different and appealing."" Others praised it for its sweet flavor balanced syrup and nice cherry flavor. Fun fact: Dr Pepper is actually a unique blend of 23 flavors according to the company website. We would bet you a Dr Pepper Zero that one of the most prominent ones is cherry.

Pepsi Zero Sugar

Pepsi's Zero Sugar also known as Pepsi Max in some countries was the resounding favorite of tasters. Tasters praised its refreshing taste pleasant aftertaste and superb balance. It tasted the most like a classic cola.

With this new campaign Coca‑Cola aims to encourage people especially the youngsters in the country to pause their hectic schedules and take a break – with a Coke! The brand empathizes with the youth and understands that ‘taking breaks’ is now more important than ever especially during these unprecedented times. As the younger population grapples with everyday hurdles in their personal and professional lives the lively campaign film urges them to take short breaks regularly and enjoy a Coca‑Cola alongside to rejuvenate them in body and mind and spirit.

Commenting on the TVC Kaushik Prasad Director – Coca‑Cola Category for India & South West Asia said “The last two years have been unprecedented for everyone and people across age-groups have found themselves grappling with multiple uncertainties and challenges. The pandemic has particularly impacted youngsters who have juggled between multiple responsibilities to cope with the new normal and often find themselves needing breaks to recharge. We at Coca‑Cola understand this and with our new campaign urge our audiences especially the youth to take these much-needed breaks during their hectic days esp when their energy is down to uplift energize & recharge themselves with a delicious “Thanda” (cold Coke).”

He further added “The youth icons Janhvi Kapoor and Ishan Khatter have brought their own liveliness and energy to the campaign film which is indeed very refreshing.”

Speaking on their association with Coca‑Cola Ishaan Khatter said “I am bubbling with enthusiasm on being the face of Coca‑Cola the beverage that is an indelible part of our lives! Excited to share this campaign for the OG ‘Thanda’ with everybody.”

Janhvi Kapoor added “Coke is an iconic brand. It’s my go-to drink for every reason and season. I am delighted to be part of the Coca‑Cola family. I look forward to energizing teens with a dose of ‘Thanda’ this summer.”

The quirky campaign by Coca‑Cola India builds upon their concept of ‘Khud Ko Jagaa Ek Thanda Lagaa’ and aims to position the beverage as the ‘perfect partner for when the slump gets to you and you need a break’. The film has been conceptualized by McCann World Group depicts a young guy who accidentally boards the ‘Ladies Special’ bus because he’s exhausted and zoned out due to the peak-summer mid-day heat and can’t think clearly enough. To know what happens next you’ll have to watch the TVC. Link below.

Sambit Mohanty McCann Creative Head (South) says about the campaign “It’s peak summer you’re fatigued and in a state of slump. What better than a chilled bottle of Coke to leave you feeling refreshed & uplifted! Our new ‘Khud ko Jagaa Ek Thanda Lagaa’ campaign is a manifestation of what happens in these circumstances. The films starring Ishaan & Janhvi play on the natural chemistry between them with Coke as a catalyst.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsaXRlZGFpbHkuY29tL25ld3MvZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLWNva2UtYm90dGxlcy01MHRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney World's New 50th Anniversary Coca-Cola Bottles Sparkle In EARidescence,"Get ready to light up your next visit to Disney World with some celebratory bottles of your favorite theme park sip: Coca-Cola.

“Track and field is the great equalizer since anyone with the desire and a pair of sneakers can participate.” Meet Director of the Colgate Women’s Games Cheryl Toussaint shared this profound quote when speaking about how the sport of track and field changed her life which in turn helped positively affect countless girls from all over the East Coast and specifically in the New York Metro Area who’ve participated in the Colgate Women’s Games over the decades. Every year the Colgate Women’s Games takes place in New York bringing together thousands of young women and girls interested in track and field and furthering their education. After a pandemic pause in 2021 the games are back on in New York starting April 3rd. We chatted with Cheryl Toussaint about this year’s event.

The History

Decades before the start of the games Cheryl was a young girl with humble beginnings from Brooklyn. During her childhood she would race friends just for fun in the neighborhood. Like many children in similar economic circumstances Cheryl was unaware of running as a team sport and the opportunities it could provide.

Cheryl shared “I didn’t know that running was a team sport until I was 13 but one day I heard about a track meet and entered on the spot because I wanted to see what it would be like to compete against real runners. I was totally unprepared and wasn’t dressed properly but I ended up finishing in fourth place. That moment changed my life forever. All three girls who finished ahead of me in that fortuitous race belonged to the same running team which is how I first learned about the Atoms Track Club and met my longtime coach mentor and founder of Colgate Women’s Games Fred Thompson.”

In 1974 Colgate Women’s Games was founded with an emphasis on education and athletic excellence. The games were birthed just a few years after Cheryl competed in the 1972 Olympics where she took home a silver medal. Colgate Women’s Games is a developmental series which provides a space for girls and women who might not otherwise have the opportunity to participate in organized sports. It is a place where Olympians and aspiring young athletes develop and compete side-by-side and encourage one another.

Cheryl remembers founder Fred fondly and his reason for starting “Fred served as our mentor and trained girls and young women at a time when there weren’t many athletic opportunities for girls and inner-city youth like me and it was where I discovered and grew my athletic talent.” For over four decades Colgate-Palmolive has served as the title sponsor of the games allowing for the success of the event and awarding more than one hundred educational scholarships each year.

After a life dedicated to helping young women succeed in the sport in the community and in their careers Fred unfortunately passed away in 2019 from complications from Alzheimer’s disease. His legacy lives on through the games.

The Games

The opportunity to witness this incredible display of events and sportsmanship is ready to kick off. Cheryl shared some insight on what spectators and participants can expect “Each year the free New York City-based meets attract thousands of competitors of all ages from up and down the East Coast. The series offers competitors the chance to win trophies and educational scholarships from sponsor Colgate-Palmolive and has empowered thousands of girls to get into and pay for college and go on to have successful careers. I was able to defray the cost of graduate studies with scholarships I earned from participation in Colgate Women’s Games.”

This year’s games open with the preliminary competitions on April 3 and April 10 at St. John’s University DaSilva Field Queens NY. The semi-finals and finals will be held at Icahn Stadium in New York City on April 16th and 24th. Attendees can expect to see traditional track and field events such as the 100m 200m and 400m dashes hurdles and field events.

The event has served as a training ground for an astounding 29 Olympians (including two Gold medalists at the Tokyo 2020 Games) and has trained hundreds of National Champions so a chance to see a future star is possible. Cheryl shared that with the close proximity of the games in NYC Hudson County students often participate and compete against other local athletes.

For the last 46 years Cheryl has been part of the Colgate Women’s Games. In 2014 she stepped into the position of Meet Director and in 2022 will be overseeing all elements of the program “I am honored to be overseeing the 47th season of the series and providing women and young girls with the same opportunity I was given to realize their potential.” As the games continue the mission of providing great opportunities and opening doors for young girls both in athletics and in education continues.

This week China promised a tax-evasion crackdown on social-media influencers who are paid by brands to promote products online to armies of followers. One of the big stars Viya a 30-something fashionista known as the live-streaming queen has already been fined $210m for not declaring her income. The size of that levy shows the sheer scale of the industry which accounts for 12% of online sales in China. Outside China influencers are also likely to have an enduring role in e-commerce. For all firms with brands—and together those brands are worth over $7trn—it is time to realise that influencing is more than just a hobby.

The use of personal endorsements used to be about harnessing existing celebrity power. Elizabeth Taylor touted Colgate-Palmolive’s shampoo in the 1950s and Michael Jordan’s deal in 1984 with Nike revolutionised both basketball and branding. Influencers turn the logic on its head: selling things helps make them more famous. Through curated feeds of clipped videos and filtered photos they offer recommendations to consumers mingled with glimpses into their daily lives that give their artifice an aura of authenticity. Sometimes they disclose how they are paid. Often they do not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubmouY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvamVyc2V5am91cm5hbC9uYW1lL2Vkd2FyZC13aWxsaWFtc29uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM0MDIwMzEx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Edward Williamson Obituary (2022) - Bayonne NJ - The Jersey Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.nj.com/us/obituaries/jerseyjournal/name/edward-williamson-obituary?id=34020311 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubmouY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvamVyc2V5am91cm5hbC9uYW1lL2Vkd2FyZC13aWxsaWFtc29uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM0MDIwMzEx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9iZXJuYXJkLWVzc2VsaW5rLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzOTcxOTA20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bernard Esselink Obituary (2022) - Westport CT - Hartford Courant,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/hartfordcourant/name/bernard-esselink-obituary?id=33971906 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9iZXJuYXJkLWVzc2VsaW5rLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzOTcxOTA20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwbm5ld3MuY29tL2NvbGdhdGUtYnJpbmdzLWFkdmFuY2VkLWVsZWN0cmljLXRvb3RoYnJ1c2gtdGVjaG5vbG9neS10by1pbmRpYS_SAVhodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcG5uZXdzLmNvbS9jb2xnYXRlLWJyaW5ncy1hZHZhbmNlZC1lbGVjdHJpYy10b290aGJydXNoLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktdG8taW5kaWEv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colgate brings advanced Electric Toothbrush technology to India!,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apnnews.com/colgate-brings-advanced-electric-toothbrush-technology-to-india/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwbm5ld3MuY29tL2NvbGdhdGUtYnJpbmdzLWFkdmFuY2VkLWVsZWN0cmljLXRvb3RoYnJ1c2gtdGVjaG5vbG9neS10by1pbmRpYS_SAVhodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcG5uZXdzLmNvbS9jb2xnYXRlLWJyaW5ncy1hZHZhbmNlZC1lbGVjdHJpYy10b290aGJydXNoLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktdG8taW5kaWEv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Roger Adamson is the CEO of the The George Foundation which for 77 years has been granting millions of dollars to organizations and residents of Fort Bend County.

Adamson says that for 25 years the organization has planned for the eventual construction of the Grand Parkway through its land saying that a toll road would increase the value of the adjacent George Foundation land.

“Real Estate assets account for about 40% of our asset base that we use to fund our charitable Mission” he said. “And so this tremendous amount of value will allow us to monetize our real estate assets to support our charitable mission.”

This map lays out the proposed different routs of the Grand Parkway and the Fort Bend Toll Road (The George Foundation)

The above map lays out the Grand Parkway and Toll road possibilities.

The problem as the George Foundation sees it is that the route was changed off their property and will cost them millions in lost property values and says the Fort Bend County Commissioners won’t provide an answer about why the change was made.

Adamson is a guest on Houston Newsmakers and also on HOUSTON NEWSMAKERS EXTRA.

Daniel Signorelli is the President and CEO of the Signorelli Company. He says the route of Segment C of the Grand Parkway was changed back to way it should be.

The way it was when he purchased a property adjacent to The George Foundation in order to build a 4700 Acre Master Planned Community.

“The foundation had that intersection moved on their property months after I closed and over the last two years of discussions and back and forth the Commissioners Court bipartisan unanimously voted to put the intersection back on our property for the benefit of Fort Bend County.” he said.

Signorelli is also a guest along with environmental attorney Larry Nettles to discuss the issue and also take part in HOUSTON NEWSMAKERS EXTRA.

Comcast uses federal funding toward customer discounts

Recently passed federal legislation is providing millions of dollars across the country in an effort to improve internet connectivity with an eye on decreasing the digital divide that exists between the haves and have nots in this country.

Comcast is using that money to provide discounts for customers who might not otherwise have been able to afford internet.

Foti Kallergis is the Senior Director of Public Relations and External Communications for Comcast and is a guest along with Jamila Byrd a woman who is benefiting from several of the offered programs.

“The affordable connectivity program really is a once in a lifetime program by the federal government to help folks get internet in their homes by providing a 30 dollar monthly credit toward their internet bill” Kallergis said. “Never in this country have we had something like this before”

“It’s a non-displaced fracture in his foot and he’s going to be late to the season” Hinch said. “The films initially came back (showing) the fracture and we had it evaluated by Dr. Robert Anderson who is an expert foot doctor. He confirmed the diagnosis.”

A non-displaced fracture is where the bone breaks in one spot and stays aligned. Surgery is not required and the general timeframe for recovery is six to eight weeks. For Greene an otherwise healthy 21-year-old athlete the timeline could be shorter.

“A timeline at this point would be unnecessary” Hinch said. “He will get it reviewed again in a few weeks and get a further diagnosis.”

Greene the No. 2-ranked prospect in the Tigers’ system was on track to win the Opening Day center field job.

""I feel for him"" Hinch said. ""He was having a great spring. He was trending in the right direction super energetic great kid great attitude. He took the news as positively as he could. I'm truly disappointed for him and for our organization.""

Greene's injury changes the landscape of the Tigers' outfield especially after Hinch also announced that Derek Hill (hamstring) would not be able to start the season on time.

It leaves three true outfielders in camp — Victor Reyes who will likely be the Opening Day center fielder Robbie Grossman and Akil Baddoo.

""Right now internally we will look at Eric Haase and Willi Castro being more geared toward the outfield"" Hinch said. Haase is the back-up catcher to Tucker Barnhart and Castro has primarily been a utility infielder.

""Victor Robbie and Akil will take down a lot of innings in the outfield"" he said.

Hinch said outfielder Daz Cameron who was optioned to Triple-A earlier in the week was not coming back to camp.

""The group we have now is the group we are evaluating"" Hinch said.

No labels required Tigers' Alexander just a 'really good' big-league pitcher

General manager Al Avila said he will continue to try to upgrade the team before Opening Day but it was more probable that they would fill the void left by Greene's injury from within.

""We're looking at all possibilities we really are in several areas"" Avila said. ""But I do believe most probably the help will come internally from our own guys. Hill has a nick right now but that should just be a couple of weeks at the most we hope.

""I think internally we can handle this. But we're always going to be looking. Anything can happen.""

Reyes has played 108 games in center field the last four years posting a minus-3 defensive runs saved. He played 20 games out there last year (minus-4).

""I'm ready for it"" Reyes said.

Baddoo who projects to be the starting left fielder played 66 games in center last year with a minus-4 defensive runs saved.

""I have a ton of confidence when Victor plays"" Hinch said. ""But center field is the biggest challenge for him. And frankly it's a challenge for Akil too and the numbers will back that up. But Victor is sure-handed and he will make the plays he's supposed to make. He controls the fundamentals of the position.

""Both Victor and Akil will get an opportunity to play out there. They're good players and that's what's important.""

Had Hill's right hamstring not tightened up on Wednesday in Clearwater the center field job would likely have been his a fact that's not lost on him.

""I know trust me on that I know"" Hill said Saturday. ""The last two springs I've had a little something to deal with. This ain't nothing to be upset about. Just have to deal with it. Just get better and get back to the squad.""

Hill and lefty reliever Andrew Chafin who will also not opening the season on time because of a groin injury will stay back in Lakeland and work through extended spring. Both will eventually need rehab assignments probably with Toledo before being activated.

""I think both of those guys will have games to play (with the Tigers) in April"" Hinch said. ""Just as an example of a loose timeline.""

Greene was having a productive spring hitting .429 this spring with a 1.548 OPS. On the next pitch after he broke his foot he drilled an off-speed pitch from Cole 404 feet off the wall in center and sped around to third base.

""That's what gave us pretty good optimism even leaving the game"" Hinch said. ""He was going to come out with a sore foot regardless but it wasn't as if he reported a ton of pain. He had a little bit of swelling but when he came out he was still grimacing. We just told him to go in for precautionary x-rays.""

He stayed on base for four more hitters before scoring on an infield single by Javier Baez.

""Something to be said for adrenalin"" Hinch said. ""Just like (Gregory) Soto last year broke his finger and threw 100 mph. Sometimes adrenalin is a good thing.""

Avila like Hinch was impressed at the way Greene has handled the setback thus far.

""He's handling it better than anybody"" he said. ""I was in there (clubhouse) earlier today and he's just ready to get back to it. There's a plan there and he's ready to get after it. But the players are disappointed for him we all are.

""I had to make sure AJ didn't jump over the ledge. 'It'll be fine. This is short-term.'""

While the coin no longer trends like it did in 2021 and isn’t the talk of the town Dogecoin DOGE/USD could soon find itself trending and shooting higher on the heels of the one-year anniversary of some important dates.

What Happened: Dogecoin saw its two strongest months of 2021 in April and May which could put the cryptocurrency back in the spotlight as the 2022 calendar hits April.

Dogecoin started April 2021 trading at $0.0536 and ended the month trading at $0.4377. The coin saw a public company shout out the crypto on its earnings call with Conagra Brands Inc CAG highlighting how Dogecoin helped boost the Slim Jim brand’s social media following.

April 2021 also saw Benzinga’s most read article of the year with a look at how much a hypothetical investment in Dogecoin on Jan. 1 2021 was worth after the recent run in the coin’s value.

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban highlighted how more people were using Dogecoin to pay for tickets and merchandise from the team.

Dogecoin was also added to Webull due to high demand.

The two biggest events for Dogecoin in April 2021 were likely Doge Day which took place on April 20 2021 and the announcement that Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk would appear as the host of an episode of “Saturday Night Live” on Comcast Corp’s CMCSA NBC channel in May.

The month of May 2021 saw Dogecoin hit an all-time high of $0.7375 led by the appearance of Musk on “Saturday Night Live.” Shortly after the coin fell and an announcement by Coinbase Global COIN that the crypto would be added to the popular trading platform couldn’t save a decline in the price.

Investing $100 In Dogecoin: Many in the Dogecoin community called for the cryptocurrency to hit $1. The price target was laughed at by many as it would give Dogecoin a huge market capitalization and comes from a crypto with unlimited supply.

Doge Day 2021 and Musk’s appearance couldn’t power Dogecoin to the $1 mark could 2022 be any different?

The likelihood of Dogecoin hitting $1 comes with low chances but a call for more retailers to accept Dogecoin and the potential for the community to rally behind Doge Day 2022 could help provide a chance in 2022.

Investing $100 in Dogecoin today could buy 712.25 DOGE based on the current $0.1404 price for the cryptocurrency.

If Dogecoin can hit the $1 level the $100 investment in Dogecoin would be worth $712.25. This would represent a return of 612% on the current investment.",,,

While the coin no longer trends like it did in 2021 and isn’t the talk of the town Dogecoin DOGE/USD could soon find itself trending and shooting higher on the heels of the one-year anniversary of some important dates.

What Happened: Dogecoin saw its two strongest months of 2021 in April and May which could put the cryptocurrency back in the spotlight as the 2022 calendar hits April.

Dogecoin started April 2021 trading at $0.0536 and ended the month trading at $0.4377. The coin saw a public company shout out the crypto on its earnings call with Conagra Brands Inc CAG highlighting how Dogecoin helped boost the Slim Jim brand’s social media following.

April 2021 also saw Benzinga’s most read article of the year with a look at how much a hypothetical investment in Dogecoin on Jan. 1 2021 was worth after the recent run in the coin’s value.

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban highlighted how more people were using Dogecoin to pay for tickets and merchandise from the team.

Dogecoin was also added to Webull due to high demand.

The two biggest events for Dogecoin in April 2021 were likely Doge Day which took place on April 20 2021 and the announcement that Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk would appear as the host of an episode of “Saturday Night Live” on Comcast Corp’s CMCSA NBC channel in May.

The month of May 2021 saw Dogecoin hit an all-time high of $0.7375 led by the appearance of Musk on “Saturday Night Live.” Shortly after the coin fell and an announcement by Coinbase Global COIN that the crypto would be added to the popular trading platform couldn’t save a decline in the price.

Investing $100 In Dogecoin: Many in the Dogecoin community called for the cryptocurrency to hit $1. The price target was laughed at by many as it would give Dogecoin a huge market capitalization and comes from a crypto with unlimited supply.

Doge Day 2021 and Musk’s appearance couldn’t power Dogecoin to the $1 mark could 2022 be any different?

The likelihood of Dogecoin hitting $1 comes with low chances but a call for more retailers to accept Dogecoin and the potential for the community to rally behind Doge Day 2022 could help provide a chance in 2022.

Investing $100 in Dogecoin today could buy 712.25 DOGE based on the current $0.1404 price for the cryptocurrency.

If Dogecoin can hit the $1 level the $100 investment in Dogecoin would be worth $712.25. This would represent a return of 612% on the current investment.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The FDNY called Con Edison around 9:48 p.m. requesting that service be turned off for three customers in the area of West 10th Street and Seventh Avenue the utility told The Post.

No injuries were reported Con Ed said.

Video shows several fire trucks and about a dozen firefighters and other responders at the scene — where steam fires rapidly out of the ground near a sidewalk.

In the area around the main leak steam also shot out from the sides of manhole covers in the street.

Several passersby stopped to watch the spectacle.

The FDNY did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for further details.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpYmVyYXRpb25uZXdzLm9yZy9vdmVyLW9uZS1taWxsaW9uLW5ldy15b3JrZXJzLWF0LXJpc2stb2YtdXRpbGl0eS1zaHV0b2ZmLWluLWFwcmlsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Over one million New Yorkers at risk of utility shutoffs in April – Liberation News,"Across New York State over 1.2 million residential gas and electric customers are 60 or more days behind on their utility bill. The total debt owed — nearly $1.8 billion — has more than doubled since the start of the pandemic. These households are all at risk of having their utilities shut off April 15 as New York’s utility shutoff protections expire.

The Public Utility Law Project estimates that there is over $1 billion of debt in telephone internet and water services each. Combined this amounts to almost $4.8 billion in missed payments for utilities during the pandemic that residents are liable for with the end of this moratorium.

In spring of 2020 New York passed a utility shutoff moratorium protecting access to heat water gas electricity internet and telephone services during the beginning of the pandemic. New York lawmakers allowed this COVID-19 protection to quietly expire on Dec. 21 2021. Despite the program ending in December current state regulations urge utility companies to continue services until the end of the “cold weather season” which ends on April 15.

This could set off the largest wave of utility shutoffs the city has ever seen. In response state officials have encouraged residents to apply for the statewide Home Energy Assistance Program. This program can provide up to $751 towards heating assistance. However this program is only available to households that are already receiving government assistance and/or with an income at or below 130% of the federal poverty line.

Another avenue of utility assistance — the state’s Emergency Rental Assistance Program — ran out of funding back in September 2021. There are people who have been approved for this program and are still waiting to receive the financial assistance as their bills keep rising. Through this program only 359 New York households received utility assistance through December. This was the lowest number in the country. In contrast Texas had provided utility assistance to over 120000 households in the same timeframe.

New York City and Westchester are home to over 400000 of these vulnerable residents who collectively owe almost $820 million just in utility bills. Low-income communities communities of color and the elderly will be the hardest hit by utility shutoffs just as they have been amongst the most impacted by the pandemic since it started.

In November PULP along with the American Associations of Retired Persons the Asian American Federation the Hispanic Federation and other groups sent a letter to Gov. Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers warning them of the impending crisis.

“[H]ouseholds statewide have been plunged into intractable debt that might take a decade or more to resolve” the letter states. “This debt will impair credit require New Yorkers to choose between medical food or utility arrears spending and reduce economic activity that is essential to preserving the viability of New York’s communities and small businesses.”

The organizations then urged state lawmakers to allocate a portion of federal pandemic aid to bail out these residents. Specifically advocates call for $1.25 billion for unpaid energy bills $400 million for water bills and $200 million in tax credits to forgive water telephone and internet bills. Gov. Hochul’s current budget proposal includes $2 billion in COVID-19 relief but the details of how the money will be allocated have not yet been determined. The deadline for lawmakers to set the budget was April 1 only two weeks before the potential shutoff.

Utility shutoffs: another attack on the working class

The risk of a utility shutoff is only the most recent attack on New York City’s poor and working class. The city’s COVID-19 eviction moratorium lapsed on Jan. 15 leaving hundreds of thousands of residents at risk of eviction. Residents can still apply for ERAP today since having an open application bars them from eviction regardless of funds available.

Even more recently New York City Mayor Eric Adams has authorized over 240 street sweeps across the boroughs destroying the shelters and belongings of the city’s houseless population. Adams does this because he claims that the efforts are meant to push the houseless into shelters providing “health[ier] living conditions” despite numerous reports to the contrary.

This crisis also comes soon after New York gas and electricity providers came under fire for skyrocketing bills this past winter season seeing prices rise as much as 121% in a month. In response to the outrage of their customers Consolidated Edison executives say that they are currently “reviewing their billing practices.” Residents impacted by this price gouging are eligible to apply for HEAP.

Enough is enough

Across the country politicians and lawmakers are ending pandemic-era protections leaving the working class with billions of dollars in debt during a time of rising rents hyper-inflation and food shortages.

Organizers however are determined to fight back against these nationwide shutoffs.

“The lack of adequate social and financial support over the course of the pandemic and now the inflation crisis has left communities in desperate need of relief” Sameena Rahman stated in a recent article for Liberation News. “It’s time that these temporary relief programs be cemented into permanent social programs and remove the power of greedy landlords utility companies and banks to enact widespread suffering in communities across the country.”

Enough is enough! We must stand together and demand that these utility debts be canceled!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMDIvcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9idWlsZGluZy1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItY2hhcmdlcnMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can I Force My Building to Install Electric-Car Chargers? (Published 2022),"Q: I own a co-op in Woodside Queens with a dedicated garage that is locked and only I have access to it. I want to buy an electric car but the garage does not have electricity. Con Edison informed me that if I install electricity in my garage it will connect the line to the grid. However my co-op board will not give me permission to do the work saying that the technology is still new and may change. Can the board refuse my request? Is there any way to persuade it to change with the changing times?

A: Electric vehicles are coming to New York in a big way. In September New York State passed a law banning the sale of combustion engines for cars and light trucks by 2035. Residential buildings need to prepare for the changes ahead.

“I know 2035 is a long time from now but the state is going electric” said Leni Morrison Cummins a real estate lawyer in the Manhattan office of the law firm Cozen O’Connor. “It’s happening it’s just a matter of when.”",,,,,,

Costco sells over 106 million of its beloved rotisserie chickens every year but the bird flu outbreak has reached some of the company's chicken houses Forbes reports. In February over 500000 chickens in the Nebraska facilities were killed to try and stop the spread but it is still raging on.

6 Things You'll See at Costco This Year

""The outbreak is in Costco-sponsored chicken houses but the consequences of this outbreak will lead to a lot of economic pain for all the farmers involved including those that have nothing to do with Costco"" a neighboring farmer Yolanda Bailey told Forbes.

Around 25% of the supply of rotisserie chickens for Costco warehouses comes from Nebraska farms. Should these not be able to keep contributing because of infections there could be millions of fewer rotisserie chickens under the heaters at Costco or they could become more expensive. (The warehouse chain has been criticized in the past for its treatment of the birds on its farms leading to some suggesting that Costco raise the $4.99 set price and use the profits to maintain better facility standards.)

Right now even if bird flu cases get under control and drop with the affected farms in a quarantine zone new birds may not be able to be brought into the Nebraska farms for weeks making a rotisserie chicken shortage even more possible at Costco. Eat This Not That! has reached out to the company for more information.

The warehouse chain isn't the only company suffering because of the outbreak. Jennie-O a brand underneath the Hormel Foods umbrella is seeing some of its turkeys and chickens become infected. It emphasizes that there is no immediate public health concern but it could lead to price hikes and/or shortages for things like eggs and meat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcmN1cnluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzAzL25ldy1wbGVhc2FudG9uLWNvc3Rjby1jb3VsZC1vcGVuLW5leHQteWVhci1hZnRlci1jb3VydC1yZWplY3RzLW9wcG9uZW50cy1hcHBlYWwv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVyY3VyeW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMDMvbmV3LXBsZWFzYW50b24tY29zdGNvLWNvdWxkLW9wZW4tbmV4dC15ZWFyLWFmdGVyLWNvdXJ0LXJlamVjdHMtb3Bwb25lbnRzLWFwcGVhbC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pleasanton Costco could open next year after court rejects opponents’ appeal,"PLEASANTON — A new Costco Wholesale store about seven years in the making could finally open its doors in Pleasanton by the end of 2023 after the latest legal challenge to stop it has failed.

The nearly 150000-square-foot Costco which will include a 20-pump gas station would be located on a currently empty 17-acre plot of land at 7200 Johnson Drive just east of Interstate 680 and north of Stoneridge Drive.

Costco appears to have a clear path toward building the store after the latest legal challenge from a group of residents who opposed it was shot down by a three-judge panel of California’s First District Court of Appeal.

The residents group called Pleasanton Citizens for Responsible Growth asserted in a March 2020 lawsuit that the city’s environmental review for the area was inadequate.

The lawsuit said the city’s environmental review didn’t consider the cumulative traffic and air quality impacts of recent growth near the I-580/I-680 interchange such as the Workday headquarters on Stoneridge Mall Road a Kaiser medical facility on Dublin Boulevard or the proposed Ikea project in Dublin about 1½ miles away.

Alameda County Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch ruled against the group in November 2020 saying that the city’s review considered the broader scope of impact for both the Costco project and nearby development.

The residents group appealed the decision in early 2021.

In late February the appeal court judges affirmed Roesch’s ruling citing a recent change to the California Environmental Quality Act commonly referred to as CEQA.

Under rules that went into effect in July 2020 “a project’s effect on automobile delay shall not constitute a significant environmental impact.”

“In light of the recent amendments to the CEQA guidelines” the judges wrote in their Feb. 28 ruling the residents’ challenges about possible traffic impacts are “moot.”

The court also rejected the resident group’s arguments about air quality impacts.

“It’s obviously frustrating for us” Matt Sullivan a former Pleasanton City Council member and one of the leaders of the residents group said about the appeals court ruling.

“When your own city council turns a deaf ear … then CEQA is really the only thing the public has to do anything about anything. When it’s undermined like this to basically cancel our argument it’s pretty tough” he said.

Sullivan said the group is evaluating whether to continue its challenge of the development.

Eric Luchini a senior city planner said in an interview that the city is moving ahead with reviewing plans for the project from Costco and is not expecting any further legal delays.

“Obviously I don’t have a crystal ball but we’re proceeding along the lines that that was our last hurdle that we need to clear” he said.

The lawsuit was the latest in a string of attempts to block the project. In 2016 a citizens referendum was put on the ballot asking voters to prohibit retail “big box” stores larger than 50000 square feet in the area and 63 percent voted no.

The city in response pulled back the approvals and a revised impact report was approved in February 2020 followed by the latest lawsuit.

Luchini said the Costco warehouse won’t be able to open until road improvements along Johnson and Stoneridge drives are completed. In all he said the project could be finished in about 18 months.

The store will be included in a larger 40-acre area known as the Johnson Drive Economic Development Zone where Clorox buildings used to stand.

If you preorder Samsung’s 32-inch M8 4K smart monitor starting at $699.99 before April 17th you’ll get a $100 Samsung credit to use on future purchases. Just a heads-up though that the white-colored model that costs $699.99 is currently set to deliver in early May. Other colors like green and pink (which cost $30 more) will ship by April 18th. There’s a blue option but it’s not available for preorder yet.

The M8 monitor has some features that many others don’t. I wrote about them all here but if you want the skinny here goes: it can run smart TV apps like Apple TV Plus Netflix and more even if you don’t have a computer or streaming device to connect to it. If you connect a mouse and keyboard to it you can access Microsoft Office apps too. What’s more it includes a webcam that snaps onto the top with which you can do video chats via Google Duo.

Microsoft’s small but capable Xbox Series S console is $30 off its usual price at Newegg. When you enter the code APRBRA338 at checkout the price falls from $299.99 to $269.99 before tax. We’ve seen slightly better deals before but regardless if you’re a current or prospective Game Pass Ultimate subscriber it’s like getting two months for free.

Just in case you weren’t aware the Series S is little sibling to the Series X and its features and power are predictably lesser. Notably it lacks a disc drive and it targets high frame rates at less than 4K resolution. So it’s not the right console for a more discerning gamer who needs best-in-class performance. But it could be the perfect device for someone who needs a streaming device-meets-console.

You can check out without a Costco membership but it’ll add $4.75 (five percent of the cost) to your total.

In October 2019 the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSASI) put out a position statement regarding oral allergy medication stating that newer antihistamines were safer than first-generation ones and that they should be recommended over older staples like Benadryl due to a higher rate of potential side effects. The position statement referred specifically to medications that treat non-life-threatening allergic reactions such as hay fever and hives.

If it’s news to you that Benadryl is no longer recommended as a first-line treatment for common allergies you’re not the only one. In 2022 it’s not only adult patients and parents who are still influenced by brand familiarity and haven’t made the switch — some doctors are as well experts say.

“I think there are a fair number of pediatricians who still recommend Benadryl for allergies” Daniel Flanders owner and executive director of Kindercare Pediatrics in Toronto Ontario told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview.

“And if you speak to an allergist they would simply say that that's outdated advice.”

Benadryl is one of the most well-known brands for allergy medication with numerous products available to buy without a prescription including versions specifically made for children. Benadryl is approved by Health Canada which has deemed it safe for over-the-counter use concluding in a recent safety review of first-generation antihistamines that there hasn’t been any change in risk that would prompt it to change the drug to prescription-only.

While both first and second-generation antihistamines bind to receptors in the brain and spinal cord to block the release of histamines — the chemicals that cause allergy symptoms — first-generation crosses the blood-brain barrier and causes more sedation in patients something that was corrected in second-generation antihistamines.

Because of this difference first-generation antihistamines like Benadryl are associated with more side effects such as increased drowsiness issues with motor functions and working memory as well as a risk of hallucination or even death in the event of an overdose.

But if many experts have believed for years that Benadryl shouldn’t be the first choice for oral allergy medication anymore why are many Canadians and doctors unaware of this?

“Unfortunately far too often physicians and other health-care practitioners including pharmacists and paramedics continue to commonly recommend Benadryl as a first line antihistamine for treatment of allergic symptoms including symptoms from food allergy” CSACI told CTVNews.ca in an email adding that its 2019 messaging has “still not reached many health-care practitioners.”

Flanders said that while he’s not aware of any doctors in his clinic still recommending Benadryl there are likely many across Canada still turning to the well-known allergy medication to treat mild allergies.

“I would say probably for 10 years it has been the case that we've known that it's better to use the second and third generation antihistamines preferentially over Benadryl but […] one of the funny things about medicine is that it does take a long time for information to trickle down from research through to practice” he said.

“It is measured in years. It's not uncommon but it takes a good 10 years for the standard of care for the practice to adjust to some of the changes that science discovers.”

Flanders said if he had to make an estimate anywhere from 25 to 50 per cent of pediatricians may still be recommending Benadryl as a first line treatment though he cautioned that this is just his personal assessment.

“I'm hopeful that more than half of my colleagues are making that correct recommendation [instead of Benadryl]” he said.

A big reason that Benadryl is still recommended by health-care professionals is the familiarity of that brand name which has been a giant in allergy medication for decades.

“Benadryl has so much recognition as an allergy remedy” Flanders said. “The trade name is so well known and so commonly used that I could imagine it would take a whole lot of work to sort of deprogram and reprogram parents' minds. And also the minds of doctors who are not sort of keeping up with the cutting edge [of medicine].”

It was a sentiment that CSACI echoed.

“The familiarity of health-care practitioners parents and adult patients with Benadryl and other first generation antihistamines makes it difficult to motivate changes in practice” the organization said.

WHY DID CSACI DECIDE BENADRYL SHOULDN’T BE RECOMMENDED?

More than two years ago CSACI put out a paper explaining that newer antihistamines are just as effective and safer than first-generation antihistamines such as Benadryl and that they should always be recommended over older antihistamines.

CSACI says bilastine and cetirizine are among the newer antihistamines recommended.

The active ingredient in Benadryl sold in Canada is diphenhydramine and it’s one of the oldest first-generation antihistamines having been available for sale since 1946.

In the position statement CSASI explained that older antihistamines are associated with more severe side effects than second and third generation antihistamines which became available in Canada starting in the 1980s and had to pass high-quality trials.

“It is always preferred to use safer and more effective medications” CSACI told CTVNews.ca in an email. “First generation antihistamines are significantly more likely to cause side effects including sedation poor sleep quality and poor cognitive performance (including poor school and work performance). In addition overdoses of first generation antihistamines can cause severe toxicity.”

Johnson & Johnson the company that sells Benadryl in Canada did not respond to a request for comment from CTVNews.ca.

In 2019 the company told the Canadian Press that “Benadryl products have been trusted by doctors and moms for more than 60 years to provide effective symptom relief from allergies and allergic reactions” and that the products are approved by Health Canada and ""when used as directed are safe and effective.""

CSACI’s position statement explained that newer antihistamines have less serious side effects associated with them and that as of 2019 accidental exposure to higher levels of second and third generation antihistamines had not resulted in severe adverse events unlike first generation antihistamines.

In 2020 a TikTok “challenge” spurred some teenagers to take enough Benadryl to induce hallucinations which resulted in several teens being rushed to hospital.

The CSACI statement mentioned that in Canada online surveys had shown that Benadryl was at the time the “most recommended antihistamine for allergic symptoms in children in each of the last 7 years.”

WHY IS BENADRYL STILL AVAILABLE OVER THE COUNTER?

It’s important to note that Benadryl isn’t considered dangerous — when instructions are followed serious side effects are rare.

CSACI’s position was that there are new options that are just as effective and have fewer side effects overall or milder side effects.

“I wouldn't so much say that one should never use [Benadryl] it just doesn't make sense to use it currently or in present day because there are alternatives that are just as good and have a better side effect profile” Flanders explained.

“Why would you take a medication that you know has significant side effects when you can take another medication that does the exact same thing but without the side effects?”

After CSACI released this position statement in 2019 there was a flurry of articles that questioned whether Benadryl should be available as over-the-counter medication. As a result Health Canada announced that while products containing diphenhydramine met the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act they would be assessing “to determine if further risk mitigation measures for diphenhydramine-containing products are required” noting that the safety of children was a big concern of the Canadian public.

On March 1 of this year Health Canada posted a summary of that safety review which focused on whether there have been any increases in frequency of the known side effects associated with oral over-the-counter diphenhydramine in children under two years old or an increase in frequency of overdoses in children under 18.

“There are no new safety concerns to warrant regulatory action at this time” Health Canada stated in the monthly Health Product InfoWatch.

Flanders believes that one of the factors driving Benadryl’s enduring ubiquity in the minds of Canadians is because it’s available so easily.

“I think it would make sense to take Benadryl off the list of over-the-counter allergy medications because just there are better options and there are side effects and those can have long term implications” he said.

“And that might be a nice way to sort of educate or to leave the general public with no choice but to choose a more appropriate medication.”

In 2019 some pharmacists pointed out that putting Benadryl behind the counter doesn’t solve the safety issues and could cause conflict if customers are still pushing for it.

Nardine Nakhla a pharmacist who teaches at the University of Waterloo in Ontario said at the time that there are many other products that contain diphenhydramine that are on the shelves making it unrealistic to pull all of them and that there are other products available over the counter that have safety concerns making this a complicated problem.

IF I HAVE BENADRYL AT HOME SHOULD I KEEP USING IT FOR MYSELF OR MY KIDS?

For CSACI it’s pretty straightforward.

“It is strongly encouraged that parents replace older first generation antihistamines such as Benadryl in their medicine cabinets with newer generation antihistamines” it stated.

Flanders said that his advice depends on a family’s budget.

“If the purchase was made and there isn't much money in the budget and there's really bad allergy symptoms that need to be controlled then Benadryl will do the trick so I think it's reasonable to complete the package” he said. “And then next time you need it buy the newer generation antihistamine.”

But if the cost of replacing the Benadryl immediately isn’t a concern “then I would go right ahead and buy the new one and throw out the Benadryl because there's better options” he said.

CSACI’s position statement pertained to all ages but Flanders said that as a pediatrician he is more concerned about making sure that children are receiving the best medication for whatever ails them.

“I think there's an added dimension of risk for children because they're still developing and they're still in a very formative period of their lives. So if a child is chronically sleep deprived I think there are more dire long term consequences” he said referring to side effects for Benadryl pertaining to poor sleep.

“For kids who are going to be taking it on a regular basis it does interfere with the quality of their sleep and it can interfere with learning and with their sort of day to day functioning. It's not like it's the end of the world if you take Benadryl periodically for allergy relief it's just there's better options.”

WHICH NEWER ANTIHISTAMINES ARE PREFERRED?

CSACI gave CTVNews.ca a list of newer antihistamines currently available in Canada that it recommends over first-generation antihistamines:

bilastine (Blexten)

cetirizine (Reactine)

desloratadine (Aerius)

fexofenadine (Allegra)

loratadine (Claritin)

rupatadine (Rupall)

“Many of these are available over-the-counter some of which are also available as generic preparations and others are only available by prescription” CSACI stated."

Bob Cummins was appointed in 2019 by Gov. Janet Mills to serve on the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services or MCILS which oversees the state’s defense of adults and juveniles who cannot afford to hire attorneys. Cummins 89 is a career defense attorney and lawyer at the Portland-based law firm of Norman Hanson and DeTroy.

Cummins said he faced an “irreconcilable conflict” between his professional career and the state’s commitment to improving its indigent legal defense system. He said the state had not acted on reports that offered “the chance to effect true reform.”

“There are a host of reasons for this misfeasance but it seems to boil down to a ‘I just don’t give a damn attitude’ ” Cummins wrote in his resignation letter on Wednesday.

The governor’s office refuted Cummins’ claims pointing to increased funding for MCILS in the state budget higher hourly wages for court-appointed attorneys and $4 million earmarked in the Maine Jobs and Recovery Plan to pay for counsel fees supported by Mills and lawmakers during her term in office.

“We are sorry to learn that Mr. Cummins feels this way. However we respectfully disagree with his assessment that the executive and legislative branches ‘do not give a damn’ ” said the governor’s spokeswoman Lindsay Crete.

“The governor has and will continue to work with the Legislature to improve the delivery of legal services to low-income people in Maine to ensure their constitutional right to counsel — a right that she values and has delivered herself as someone who has repeatedly represented low-income clients throughout her own career.”

Mills and Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) plan to identify and nominate a candidate to fill Cummins’ seat Crete said. There are now two vacancies on the nine-member commission.

Commissioner Ron Schneider said Cummins’ departure was unfortunate though he respected the decision.

“He was an important voice on the commission and he provided a valuable perspective” said Schneider who declined to comment on Cummins’ specific allegations due to a pending lawsuit.

The commission met the day before Cummins’ resignation. There were heated exchanges between retired Justice Donald Alexander who was appointed to the commission in 2021 and Cummins about remarks that Maine’s defense system and MCILS are constitutionally inadequate which Alexander called “insulting” and “very wrong.”

Cummins has said that Maine’s court-appointed attorneys are in “crisis.” He helped draft a plan to transition Maine to a public defender system in 2020 and it was endorsed by the commission at the time. A bill to open the state’s first trial-level public defender office was unanimously approved by the House and Senate in 2021 but hasn’t been funded.

In March lawmakers made a new $1.7 million pitch to the state Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee to fund the opening of the public defender office in October. Funding remains uncertain.

In a letter to Mills and legislative leadership on Friday chairman of the commission Josh Tardy asked that all of the proposed MCILS initiatives be funded and the state revive unfunded proposals from 2020 and last year. It includes more staff and a public defender office for appellate and post-conviction review cases which lawmakers cut.

“We recognize that a properly provisioned indigent defense system is not inexpensive. It is also not optional” Tardy wrote.

Any additional employees or new programs will have a “fiscal tail” that will increase the baseline budget of MCILS said Tardy a Republican and former state legislator. He added that there’s reason to be cautious about using surplus or one-time funding to increase the agency’s budget.

“The argument for funding the commission and its mission is compelling constitutionally required and necessarily a priority and we need to do more than just compete in our discussions with the Appropriations Committee and the chief executive … we need to prevail in our argument” Tardy said.

Tardy had no comment on Cummins’ resignation.

The ACLU of Maine sued MCILS and its eight commissioners including Cummins earlier this year for its inaction to create an effective public defense system in alleged violation of defendants’ constitutional rights The Maine Monitor previously reported.

“As a defendant in that lawsuit who is without the ability to bring it to a correct and proper resolution consistent with the mandates of the Constitution I face a conflict that can only be resolved by leaving the Commission and by standing by my oath and by the side of the volunteer lawyers who unselfishly seek due process for the indigent accused” Cummins wrote.

Cummins previously told The Maine Monitor he is interested in joining the state’s list of eligible court-appointed attorneys and defending criminal cases. He also is interested in applying to be the state’s first chief public defender if a public defender office is opened.

“I appreciate attorney Cummins’ long history and dedication in the arena of indigent defense and the work he did on the commission” said Justin Andrus the MCILS executive director. “I look forward to seeing in what direction he takes the battle now because I am confident his resignation does not reflect withdrawal from the playing field.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9zb21lb25lLXN3YXBwZWQtY3VtbWlucy1kaWVzZWwtZm9yZC0xNjAwMDA4MDcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Someone Swapped A Cummins Diesel Into This Ford Mustang,"⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious

This is some pretty twisted fun.

YouTuber Westen Champlin has a penchant for big diesel trucks including semis. When he’s not playing with his many trucks the guy does even crazier things like swapping a Cummins diesel engine into a Ford Mustang. Just what kind of sick twisted cool individual is this guy? You really have to watch the video accompanying this article because words cannot completely describe this build.

The journey to building this Cummins-powered Mustang wasn’t an easy one something Champlin has documented for a while. Swapping the engine into the muscle car took some maneuvering but even with it installed there were some big issues like diesel pouring out of it like a civ. Yeah that shouldn’t be happening.

And just when Champlin thought he was out of the hoods the injectors started leaking. Honestly things could be so much worse with such a crazy build.

Anyway Champlin must be a pretty determined guy because along with his crew he soldiered on and fixed his weird Frankenstein pony car again and again until it now seems to run well enough. After all it does some pretty sick burnouts and who isn’t a fan of that? Plus it rolls coal with the best of them right out of a short stack from the engine bay. That’ll anger some people for sure.

With such a lightweight car packing all that diesel-powered torque this Mustang should absolutely destroy a set of tires in no time. Hopefully Champlin has a good tire guy because he’s going to need some solid discounts.

Which one put the power down in the most effective way? We put the latest 2022 Ford F-250 Power Stroke 2022 Chevy Silverado 2500 HD Duramax and a 2022 Ram 2500 HD Cummins on our new airstrip 1/4-mile track. We let these new torque-rich pickups really stretch their legs.

Here are the trucks we are testing.

Ford F-250 Chevy Silverado HD Ram HD Engine 6.7L turbo-diesel V8 6.6L turbo-diesel V8 6.7L turbo-diesel I6 S.O. Power 475 HP 445 HP 370 HP Torque 1050 Lb-Ft 910 Lb-Ft 850 Lb-Ft Transmission 10-speed Auto 10-speed Auto 6-speed Auto Curb Weight ~ 8000 lbs ~ 8200 lbs ~ 7700 lbs

The standard output 6.7L Cummins straight-six in the Ram 2500 HD is the least powerful but this Ram 2500 Big Horn crew-cab 4×4 has the lightest curb weight.

Spoiler alert: here are the final 1/4-mile drag race results (according to our SoloDL GPS device). All tests are performed at Christman Field runway in Colorado. The elevation is 5160 feet above sea level (about 1-mile high) so acceleration times are a bit slower than if tested at sea level.

As you can see the Chevy HD Duramax is very effective at putting its power to the ground. It has a significantly better 60-foot time and initial speed. The Ford Power Stroke appears to do some “torque management” even with traction control and Advance-Trac systems disabled. The Ford appears to be limiting the torque and power at first to prevent wheel spin. The Cummins has a decent launch but the acceleration slows down after 1000 feet. The Power Stroke does the opposite. The Ford comes to life further down the track and begins to pull away.

In the end the stock Cummins ran a 17.05-second 1/4-mile. The stock Duramax ran a 16.51-second 1/4-mile and the Power Stroke was the quickest at 16.05 seconds.

Please stay tuned for more fun drag races coming very soon."

About The FortySomething Fanboy

David Yi is a middle-aged Korean American man who is recently divorced and struggling with social and emotional isolation exacerbated by the conditions of COVID-19. The story opens with David’s realization that he has fallen in love with a Korean social media influencer which he finds both incredibly exhilarating and unspeakably embarrassing. David is an intelligent and articulate professional but he is also a stoic and somewhat repressed. David’s Korean-ness – or rather his lack of it – is a significant aspect of his relationships with his friends and parents. As he struggles with professional challenges because of the economic crisis and personal challenges with his ex-wife daughter friends and parents through sometimes painful and sometimes comic interactions he begins to learn more about himself and his heritage and then he makes a rash decision that suddenly changes everything for him.



About the author

Sam Choi grew up in Orange County and attended UCI majoring in English and minoring in French and Philosophy. He had the privilege of working with Professors Julia Lupton and Michelle Latiolais on his senior honors thesis which he delivered as an ever so tiny fragment of an epic poem about Spartacus. Unlike poor Spartacus Sam survived this ordeal and took his Ph.D. in English at the University of Pennsylvania and worked as an assistant professor of English at The Ohio State University where he met Professor Judy Wu as the only two Asian American professors hired that year. Despite his affliction with Buckeye fandom Professor Choi somehow escaped academia to become Sam once again and prodigally returned to Irvine where he currently shelters in one of the beautiful albeit ubiquitous cookie-cutter houses in our fair city with his wife and high school-aged son who has declared that his dream school is UCI so he can continue to hang out at the Spectrum on weekends with his friends and never have to shovel snow.

Upon entering bright new carpeting and signage lead to a waiting area and two exam rooms at the back of the store where you can walk in or make an appointment to be seen by one of two new nurse practitioners.

The Minute Clinic as the practice is called is an urgent care center and works with almost all insurance providers. Walk-ins or appointments are accepted for urgent issues as well as school sports physicals vaccinations COVID-19 testing and much more—especially helpful in taking the burden off of the pharmacists (who have spent the past two years doing COVID testing every day of the week at the drive-thru window) and doctor’s offices and hospitals which have been overly burdened throughout the pandemic.

“There’s the Greene free clinic and Greene Family Medicine and I’m sure with both of those places the volume for their healthcare needs has increased over the years” said Kelsey Morris a William Monroe graduate and nurse practitioner for the Ruckersville Minute Clinic since January 2022. “This is more or less an extra arm or an outreach to kind of help with that extra patient load; we can cover the sick visits or the injury visits … so that for the really big chronic things primary care providers are able to actually have appointments for their patients.”

Morris took nursing (CNA) classes through the Greene County Technical Education Center while she was in high school and is excited to be back working in her hometown.

“After I graduated I did a little bit of volunteering at the Stanardsville Fire Department doing assistance with their medical calls” she said. “I went to Shenandoah University to get my bachelors of science in nursing and then I worked back and forth at both UVA and Sentara Martha Jefferson’s (emergency rooms) since 2016.”

In 2016 Morris decided she wanted to give back even more—and she went back to school to get her FNP (Family Nurse Practitioner) certification. She spent a year working at an urgent care center in Harrisonburg before coming on board full-time at the Minute Clinic in Ruckersville.

“I love it; the whole reason I went back to school to do all this is because I know I can offer so much more for the community” she said. “It’s better to see everybody that you’re around be healthier … and that’s why I’m here.”

The Minute Clinic is not a brand-new idea. With partnerships through outside agencies CVS decided it could offer Minute Clinic services and has been building Health Hub locations since 2006 with more than 1200 locations nationwide to date.

“The Health Hub is an outreach part of the Clinic that does things like health screenings smoking cessation counseling and other things like that” Morris said. “And then the Minute Clinic does a lot of urgent care visits. We don’t have an X-ray machine but sore throats earaches routine vaccines screening-type things that people would need like TB tests—we have a huge variety of testing options here.”

And yes they do the COVID testing too. Rapid tests are available that give a positive or negative result in as little as 12 minutes but tests for flu strep throat RSV and pneumonia are also readily available. According to Morris the pharmacy staff has a great working relationship with the new clinic and is always available to answer questions. A small private meeting room adjacent to the pharmacy counter is available for vaccination administration or for patients to ask sensitive medication questions of the pharmacist that they’d rather not discuss at the counter.

“The good thing about the Minute Clinic is it’s a lot cheaper than an emergency room visit would be for sure” Morris said. “We do accept almost every insurance. If not we do have a self-pay price sheet online that will give (patients) a general estimate and then each test will add to their visit.”

A short list of services available at the minute clinic practitioners includes:

diagnosing and treating common illnesses such as strep throat bladder infections and pink eye as well as infections of the ear nose and throat;

treating minor wounds abrasions joint sprains and skin conditions like poison ivy ringworm lice and acne;

providing vaccinations for flu measles meningitis pneumonia pertussis hepatitis and more;

administering TB tests vitamin B12 injections (Rx required) and screenings as well as issuing medication renewals;

monitoring chronic illnesses including diabetes high cholesterol and high blood pressure;

offering routine lab tests often with instant results plus education for those with diabetes high cholesterol or high blood pressure;

writing prescriptions when medically appropriate;

treating adults and children 18 months and older;

and sharing records with your primary care provider with your permission.

The full list of services is available at minuteclinic.com and telehealth services allow remote practitioners to see patients at any hour of the day.

“Another important thing for the kids is offering school and sports physicals” added Minute Clinic PR Supervisor Patrick Seidl. “Sometimes it’s hard to get an appointment for those but they can be done at Minute Clinic and scheduled pretty quickly.”

The clinic is open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. (closed for lunch 1:30-2:30); Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (closed for lunch 1-1:30); and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (closed for lunch 1-1:30).

The medical research community now fully recognizes the human health impacts of climate change as more than 200 medical journals released an unprecedented joint statement last September citing it as the “greatest threat” to global public health.10 The issue has become a priority for the US government and human health played a markedly more central role in the dialogues of the United Nations’ COP26 global climate conference. And as part of the broader portfolio of environmental social and governance (ESG) priorities companies across the sector are increasingly focused on reducing their operational footprint even beginning to address health impacts of climate change.

At Intermountain Healthcare for example climate change has become an organizational priority driving investments in renewable energy decarbonization and energy efficiency. And even for health plan organizations with a smaller direct emissions footprint than their provider and life sciences counterparts climate and sustainability initiatives have become leadership priorities. Centene for example has increasingly prioritized environmental and climate issues over the past few years with a focus not just on emissions reduction but the impact of environmental factors on the health of their members. Health care ESG coalition groups have also emerged as important players in recent years as organizations have begun to tackle climate-related challenges head on.

Organizations such as Bon Secours Mercy Health have joined health care ESG coalition groups such as the nationwide Healthcare Anchor Network to collaborate across organizations on social determinants of health including those which are affected by environmental issues.

At the same time health care is rapidly shifting its focus from a reactive treatment of diseases and illnesses to a model that equitably and proactively promotes health and wellness across populations. This change will likely continue to accelerate as data and technology deployed in a decentralized fashion directly with consumers outside of traditional care settings allow us to have “always-on” measurements of health better understand the underlying causal mechanisms of health and wellness and predict disease and illness. This shift alone portends dramatic changes for players across the health care industry demanding new business models from both incumbents and disruptors. However climate change and its related impacts can present an enormous challenge to the realization of this healthier future.

Climate change not only contributes to a host of health issues but it can also exacerbate the health inequities that the industry has recently begun working in earnest to rectify.

That’s because the communities that are the most vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate tend to be those least equipped to manage and recover from the physical economic mental and social devastation that accompanies it.

Indeed addressing the “greatest threat” to global public health is no small undertaking. It likely requires health organizations to mitigate their own sizable carbon emissions transform their operations to meet emerging needs and engage across the sector to create more sustainable supply chains. Organizations should understand the vulnerabilities in the patient populations they care for as well as the geography-based expected climate impacts for their regions they serve. As first responders to human health emergencies and as organizations dedicated to health and well-being life sciences and health care organizations hold a responsibility to prove resiliency in times of need and to contribute to building healthier communities. Without organizational-level changes to become more climate resilient a healthier and more equitable Future of Health may not be achieved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93aHktdGF5bG9yLXN3aWZ0LXNraXBwZWQtMjAyMi0wMDU4MDA0MDMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Why Taylor Swift Skipped The 2022 Grammys Red Carpet,"Taylor Swift shocked fans and Grammy-goers alike when she didn’t walk down the red carpet at the 2022 Grammys.

Taylor Swift shocked fans and Grammy-goers alike when she didn’t walk down the red carpet at the 2022 Grammys.



The singer who is actually up for Album of the Year for “Evermore” decided to forgo the red carpet. There’s no word on exactly why she decided to skip it but she is only nominated for one award tonight so it’s a good chance that she just wanted to keep things low-key the night. The show is also taking place in Las Vegas so she might have decided not to travel all the way to Sin City. But that doesn’t mean she isn't taking part in some Grammys festivities.



Taylor and her BF Joe Alwyn were spotted at a pre-Grammys party the Friday before so she’s definitely celebrating her big nomination.

According to E! Taylor was seen talking to Zoë Kravitz “for a while” and also chilled with Hailey Bieber for a moment but was mostly “introducing Joe to many people around her. She looked smitten and proud to be there with him.”

Another source said the couple “were very couple-y and cute and seemed happy to be there together. Taylor and Joe were together all night. He was leading her around introducing her to people and Taylor also introducing people to Joe. When Joe was leading Taylor around he held his arm around her back.”

As a reminder Tay and Joe have been together since allll the way back in fall 2016 and they’ve managed to keep their relationship incredible low-key and private. They mostly don’t attend public events together although they made an exception at the 2020 Golden Globes where they were spotted sitting together at a table but made sure not to pose for any pics beforehand:

And depending on where you lurk online you may or may not be aware that there are also a ton of rumors floating around that these two are engaged. We have no proof of this but!

Hopefully Taylor does make a surprise appearance at the award show so I can go zoom in on every single screenshot of Taylor throughout the night in search of a diamond bye!

One of my all time favorite restaurants is Drew’s Bayshore Bistro in Keyport. Drew and his outstanding staff serve up Cajun American fare that will make you crave for more. Go with few people so that you can sample some of his great dishes.

Here’s a little background on Drew’s with their signature Jambalaya recipe Oh is It good!

Drew’s Bayshore Bistro

Keyport NJ

drewsbayshorebistro.com

Chef/Owner Drew Araneo serves up Cajun cuisine like no other in his hometown of Keyport NJ. In my many trips to his restaurant I’ve had the opportunity to sample all but a few of his dishes and have been blown away by his infusion of spices menu selections and specials that become customer favorites.

Chef Drew’s talent has been duly recognized with many awards including being named a semi-finalist for the prestigious James Beard Award for Chef of the Year Mid-Atlantic region. Chef Drew also had a throw down with Chef and TV personality Bobby Flay serving up his signature dish VooDoo Shrimp and walked away with the win. Chef Drew had some great influence and honed his craft by working with Jersey Shore legendary chef and my good friend the late Joe Romanowski.

Joe had a great restaurant Bay Avenue Trattoria in Highlands NJ that became the starting block of many of these fine chefs that are in this book. Hurricane Sandy came and wiped out Bay Avenue Trattoria and sadly Joe Romanowski died of cancer shortly after that.

As so many businesses in Keyport and up and down the Jersey Shore were wiped out during Hurricane Sandy so was Drew’s. Chef Drew and his wife Tracey regrouped with hard work and resilience and moved the restaurant to higher ground to the location where it sits today on Church Street.

You have to go to Drew’s. Try the VooDoo Shrimp the Gumbo when available the duck the pork dishes and the desserts are outstanding! All the desserts are house made including the ice cream!

I am thrilled that Chef Drew is sharing his famous Jambalaya recipe with me for this book. Drew’s is a great place to go with friends and family; the servers are friendly knowledgeable and have longevity with Chef Drew. Bring your favorite wine or beer and bring your appetite then you’ll see why Drew’s Bayshore Bistro is on my Top 5 list and soon to be on yours.

The annual Progress Edition features stories on unique experiences in small business dining and culture in Jamestown.

When the snow starts to melt and the sun starts to shine Aaron Raap and the staff at Valley Plains Equipment in Jamestown ready themselves for the storm.

""It's a busy time for us right now"" said Raap Valley Plains Equipment general manager. ""With the snow melting farmers are getting ready to plant and getting all of their spring work done so this is typically a busy time for us.

""We get those machines through the shop and get them fixed up and get them prepared for the planting and spring work seasons so there's a lot of activity going on right now.""

Those customers flooding the business can expect a whole new line of machines that can help out with their farming landscaping or construction projects this spring.

""In the past we've always had the agriculture contract and we've expanded that now"" Raap said. ""We brought on the compact construction line recently. We have skid steers and mini excavators so that should help with some of the small construction type customers.""

Raap said even homeowners with rural property and home sites who need a skid steer for snow removal or just working around their property can benefit from the site's recent machinery additions.

Raap said the addition of skid steers and more compact machinery models will also likely make it easier to serve agricultural customers who typically use skid steers around their property.

Making things easier on the customers is one of the things Raap said differentiates Valley Plains from other farm equipment manufacturers.

""Our people are what make the difference"" Raap said. ""I think we've got the best customer care out of anyone in the area and we're very customer-focused. We try to provide them with a high-quality customer experience.""

Valley Plains Equipment has six locations including the Jamestown site across Minnesota and North Dakota. Valley Plains offers the full John Deere Agriculture line of machinery. Raap said the site will typically service any product that complements the John Deere products.

""We wouldn't exist without our customers and we really appreciate their business and the opportunity to take care of them and help their farm be successful"" Raap said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvZGF2aWQtZmVuY2wtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzQwOTEyMznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Fencl Obituary (2022) - Waterloo IA - Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/wcfcourier/name/david-fencl-obituary?id=34091239 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvZGF2aWQtZmVuY2wtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzQwOTEyMznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFncmlsYW5kLmllL2Zhcm1pbmctbmV3cy9kb2xhbi1pbmR1c3RyaWVzLXB1dHMtZGlnaXRhbC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRvLXdvcmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dolan Industries puts digital technology to work,"Dolan industries has chosen from the bewildering array of digital systems on offer a package of machines and software options that is leading the way in showing what can now be done with the latest technology.

While machinery manufacturers might believe that its digital product will sell directly to farmers there is an alternative view which suggests that a growing proportion of this technology will arrive on the farm via contractors.

Complexity requires specialism

There is nothing startling in this it’s a well established trend however what is new is the farmer may become far more reliant on contractors to select and make work the data-based systems upon which the management of a farm may be based. L-R  John Dolan Danny Dolan and Mathew Macken

One company that is busy exploring the possibilities is Dolan Industries of Ballyglass Co. Mayo. Within its portfolio of goods and services it provides is fertiliser sales and application.

While manufacturers will boast of the accuracy of their machines and many farmers will take great care in setting them up the spreading of this expensive resource has always been something of a hit and miss affair.

Accurate field mapping

In looking to correct this John Dolan and his technical manager Mathew Macken has developed a service which extends far beyond just turning up at a farm with spreader and lorry-load of big bags.

The starting point is the mapping of the fields to be treated.

There are many GPS systems on the market and a good number of them rely on Google maps to provide a plan of the farm. The Starfire 3000 receiver is mounted to the Gator’s roof for mapping.

Yet while there is a general belief that such images are correct they found that no account was taken of elevation or gradient and so spreading based on their use was never going to give the accuracy desired.

This led to the use of a John Deere Gator fitted with a JD Starfire 3000 receiver to map the fields with the preciseness which they required.

There are two objectives to the mapping: The first is the more obvious survey of the field’s shape and area this is referred to as its external borders.

The second purpose is to locate and delineate any features or areas within the field that may require a different or zero rate of application. Such areas include alongside water courses or other sensitive regions and are referred to as the internal borders.

Testing the soil

These maps may then be complimented by soil analysis showing the nutrient status of the fields which will influence the amount of fertiliser required.

Soil analysis is an expensive pastime but with the government’s pilot Soil Sampling Programme coming on-stream this year it is expected a good deal of data will become available which wouldn’t otherwise have been collected.

The collected data is consolidated into a prescription map on the office PC

Putting these three sets of data together produces a well defined map of the area to be treated along with the variables within it which can then be used as a basis to calculate a prescription for that field.

Solving the software puzzle

There are two software packages performing the task of collating the information. The first is John Deere’s operation centre an online app which collects and acts as a repository for all the data generated by the tractors.

The second is Agrian Prescription Creator which is known to work well with the John Deere software although it is not part of John Deere itself.

This part of the operation is done in the office and will take account of any other factors which the farmer may wish to be considered fertilser availability and price being two.

What might be noted here is that should a field require different rates of Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) in different areas then they may be applied as straights over the course of a season to correct the index levels.

Dolan industries spread with a Bredal

Having created the map it can then be transferred to the spreading unit which in this case is a John Deere 6130M coupled to a Bredal 7t trailed spreader.

The tractor is fitted with the more advanced Starfire 6000 receiver while the spreader comes with its own suite of software that enables variable rate spreading and a certain degree of section control.

The spreader has a seven tonne capacity.

The tractor’s software will look after the steering and operation while Bredal’s system adjusts the application rate as the unit progresses across the field. Communication is via ISOBUS.

The spreader is equipped with weigh cells and a self calibration system thus it can adjust itself to the material flow rate in real time.

Not all fertilisers are equal

When spreading to the accuracy that is achievable the variation in the material’s characteristics very soon become apparent. Even fertilisers from the same source differ markedly as the season progresses. The spreader can cope with lime or fertiliser thanks to interchangeable discs

To ensure the accuracy of spread the two machines with two different control systems relying on the one prescription map which itself was created using two further separate items of software seems complicated.

This sounds like a recipe for disaster should any part of it go wrong and indeed it has not been all plain sailing in getting it working together hence John’s assertion that this sort of technology is going to arrive on farms via specialist contractors.

However he has particular praise for the dealers concerned especially Trevor Richardson of Atkins Farm Machinery and Joe Butler of Templetuohy Farm Machinery who both put a great deal of effort into making sure it all came together.

Gaining experience in the field

Presently this is a unique set up in Ireland and it has been a learning curve for all concerned yet the results so far are impressive with a spreading accuracy of plus or minus 1% being achieved. Weigh cells monitor the rate of application during work

In addition to the efficient use of the material a full record of application is created which can be called upon to show just what has been applied and where should there be a farm inspection or payments be dependent on proper use.

Dolan industries have realised in the flesh some of the claims for digital technology made by the manufacturers. But it has not been a simple task so while we might be bedazzled by all the marketing hype in the showroom actually making it work at ground level can often be a challenge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbW1lcmNpYWxyZWFsZXN0YXRlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL3doeS1mZWFycy1vZi1kYXRhLWhhcnZlc3RpbmctcGVyc2lzdC0xMTI4OTUxL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbW1lcmNpYWxyZWFsZXN0YXRlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL3doeS1mZWFycy1vZi1kYXRhLWhhcnZlc3RpbmctcGVyc2lzdC0xMTI4OTUxL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Agtech booms farmers remain cautious about data harvesting,“There have been some examples where companies have been found to be on-selling data to third parties mostly in an aggregated format so you can’t identify individual farmers but it’s still a concern because you can potentially cross-reference that data with other data sets and sort of re-identify individual businesses” says Charlie Thomas the federation’s general manager of corporate affairs.,,,
DAL,Delta Air Lines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8wMi9kZWx0YS1haXItbGluZXMtdGVybWluYWwtbGF4LWxvcy1hbmdlbGVzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYWlycG9ydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside the new Delta Air Lines terminal at LAX,"After years in development and ahead of what is expected to be a major rebound summer for the travel industry Delta Air Lines is opening the doors a new transit hub this spring.

The Atlanta-based airline is actually unveiling at least three new facilities this year: first at Terminal 3 within Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) followed by new terminal at New York City’s LaGuardia Airport (LGA) and additional capacity within Seattle-Tacoma International Airport’s (SEA) international arrivals facility. These projects were funded by a $12 billion investment to maximize speed efficiency and comfort at the airline’s proprietary terminals.

Delta which is currently ranked at 178 on the Fortune 500 and number 23 on among World’s Most Admired Companies in 2021 already occupies Terminal 2 at LAX. But as frequent flyers to the terminal know while it is fully upgraded in the style of 21st century airports it is extremely cramped to the point of inducing claustrophobia at peak hours especially during weekends and holidays.

Those same flyers also likely remember what Terminal 3 used to look like which was outdated to say the least. But it was a busy terminal serving the likes of JetBlue Airways and Virgin America (before its sale to Alaska Airlines in 2016) and the crunch of those missing gates and waiting areas has been felt while Terminal 2 has been the airline’s only hub at the airport. Delta announced plans that same year to move from Terminal 5 at LAX to Terminals 2 and 3 and the renovation jobs have been in the works ever since.

The new Terminal 3 will host 32 self-serve kiosks and 46 check-in counters. Courtesy of Delta Air Lines

Right now Delta offers 140 daily flights to 53 destinations across the globe from LAX. The airline has more than 4000 employees at LAX.

All of the new building systems will be LEED Silver Certified. Among the key sustainability features include low-flow water fixtures use of low-emitting materials for interior spaces for better indoor air quality a roof designed to reduce the heat island effect and maximize air conditioning energy use and recycling of over 75% of construction waste.

Also crucial: the new Terminal 3 will have double the restroom capacity than the previous iteration and it will increase capacity by a third from Terminal 2.

Delta’s new terminal will have a centralized check-in lobby an expanded security checkpoint and a larger baggage claim area. Courtesy of Delta Air Lines

In partnership with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Delta is extending its use of facial recognition technology already implemented at boarding gates within many terminals nationwide to allow qualifying customers departing LAX to check bags pass through security and board their flights completely hands-free through use of their digital identity. (Passengers are allowed to opt out of the process.)

Qualifying passengers in Delta’s premium first class cabin Delta One will also have an exclusive check-in experience with premium amenities. And the new terminal will add six additional baggage claim carrousels.

Delta has two Sky Clubs on each side of Terminal 2 but even those lounges are often full to the point where customers are waiting in line for awhile to get in—even as the airline has instituted a number of restrictions (including the elimination of being able to buy day passes) to better manage capacity.

The new Sky Club in Terminal 3 should help alleviate those crowds as it will open its doors at the same time as rest of the terminal. Measuring over 30000 square feet the new Sky Club includes ample comfortable seating a rotating seasonal menu modern shower facilities and a bar that extends from inside to the year-round on the an outdoor deck (contrary to other airports that close their outdoor seating amid more severe winter temperatures) where guests can enjoy panoramic views of downtown Los Angeles and the Pacific Coast Highway.

However while the doors to Terminal 3 initially open this spring the job isn’t done yet. Upon completion in 2023 the $2.3 billion modernization project—which includes direct investments from both Delta and Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA)—will link Terminals 2 and 3 into a 27-gate complex with a secure shuttle connection to the Tom Bradley International Terminal (Terminal B) which already serves some domestic Delta flights right now.

Seven security lanes are scheduled to open for service at Terminal 3 by April 20 with all 14 lanes fully operational later in summer 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcGhvdG8tc2hhdHRlcmVkLWNvY2twaXQtd2luZG93LWNhdXNlcy1kZWx0YS1mbGlnaHQtZW1lcmdlbmN5LWxhbmRpbmctMjAyMi000gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9waG90by1zaGF0dGVyZWQtY29ja3BpdC13aW5kb3ctY2F1c2VzLWRlbHRhLWZsaWdodC1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktbGFuZGluZy0yMDIyLTQ_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photo: Shattered cockpit window causes Delta flight to emergency land,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1kZWJ1dHMtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvLW9uLWJvc3Rvbi1zYW4tZnJhbmNpc2NvLXJvdXRlLW5leHQtbW9udGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta To Debut New Airbus A321neo On Boston-San Francisco Route Next Month,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1kZWJ1dHMtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvLW9uLWJvc3Rvbi1zYW4tZnJhbmNpc2NvLXJvdXRlLW5leHQtbW9udGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzA2NTktZmFhLXByb2JlLWRlbHRhLWJvZWluZzc1Ny13aW5kc2hpZWxkLWNyYWNrLW1pZC1mbGlnaHTSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzMwNjU5LWZhYS1wcm9iZS1kZWx0YS1ib2Vpbmc3NTctd2luZHNoaWVsZC1jcmFjay1taWQtZmxpZ2h0L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FAA to probe Delta Air Lines Boeing 757 mid-flight windshield crack,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will investigate an emergency landing case of a Delta Air Lines flight in which the flight deck windshield cracked mid-flight.

The incident occurred on March 31 2022 when the plane registered N689DL was performing a regular domestic flight DL760 between Salt Lake City and Washington in the United States. According to Flightradar24.com data the jet with 198 people on board took off from Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC) at 4.07 p.m (UTC) and was supposed to touch down at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) around four hours later. However 90 minutes after the takeoff the flight crew declared an emergency due to a cracked windshield and the plane diverted to Denver (DEN) instead.

On April 2 2022 the FAA confirmed it would conduct an investigation of the Delta Air Lines Boeing 757 jet incident.

“Out of an abundance of caution the flight crew diverted into Denver and the plane landed routinely. Our team worked quickly to accommodate customers on a new plane and we sincerely apologize for the delay and inconvenience to their travel plans” the Delta spokesperson explained to the media.

A picture of the flight deck found on social media showed a windshield lined with multiple fractures and cracks but still held in its frame.

“We were on our way to the ACC meeting when it was announced that we would need to make an unplanned landing in Denver because the windscreen cracked. It was spontaneous. Fortunately we landed safely and are about to get back in the air. We are grateful for safe flights” a passenger wrote in a post.

Outspoken hotel owner Keith Richardson has revealed that the situation is now so bad that he is now praying every morning that he will have the staff to open all four of his hotels.

And he says the situation is getting worse with the ongoing high Covid infection rates in the county and the continuing difficulties getting staff from abroad who used to fill 20 per cent of job vacancies.

The 83-year-old has owned hotels in Devon and Cornwall for the last 35 years and famously sold off his helicopter and Rolls Royce to save his troubled hotel chain back in 2018. Now Richardson Hotels is a slimmed-down empire: The Grand and The Abbey Sands in Torquay The Royal Beacon in Exmouth and The Falmouth Hotel in Cornwall.

Staffing issues are currently his biggest headache alongside rising energy costs. He said: ""It's awful really. There's a dearth of new recruits. Last September we recruited 51 staff and we lost 52 staff - so that didn't get us very far! We have lost a lot of our mid-European staff. Two years ago we had 300 staff and 60 of those were from other countries - so that's 20 per cent. I can't tell you the exact numbers now but it is significantly fewer.

""Yesterday at my littlest hotel in Exmouth we only had three staff out of six - the others were all down with Covid. We had to ship in people from our other hotels to fill the gap. Covid hasn't gone away.

""And also my chef who has been with me for 20 years at that hotel has been tempted away by better hours at a cafe where he won't have to work evenings.

He added: ""You just can't get a night porter at the moment even though wages have gone up. We are faced with all kinds of problems.

""Today the most important problem apart from rising energy bills is recruiting enough staff to keep the doors open. Every morning I hope and pray that my hotels will be open at 7am.

""We are an instant business. We cannot tell people to come back for their breakfast in four hours time. It's not like other companies who close their offices and don't even have staff answering the telephones any more.""

Asked if he thought the staffing crisis was caused by Covid or Brexit he said: ""It's bloody everything! The pundits can do all the guessing about whether it's A B or C - but whatever they guess it doesn't help us on the ground. We need more staff to run our businesses and the numbers are just not coming forward. It's very difficult.""

Mr Richardson's comments follow another well-known Westcountry hotelier's criticism of the 'benefits culture' adding to the staffing crisis. Toby Ashworth owner of the Nare hotel near Veryan on the Roseland peninsula said he thinks there is no excuse for anyone to be out of work when there are so many job opportunities available in Devon and Cornwall. And he called for changes to the work permit system to attract overseas workers which is used in Australia.

He said: ""I've never claimed benefits in my life so I can't comment on that. Also I think we already have work passes and visas for fruit pickers and now they've opened them up for lorry drivers. I don't think we are included in that system in the tourism industry and it would be helpful to us.""

Despite the staffing crisis Mr Richardson says he's still optimistic about a bumper season ahead. He said: ""We have never failed to open - we might have had restricted food offering because of staff problems but we have never NOT opened.

""Last summer we benefitted from Staycations and a lot of those customers have booked to come back and so bookings are OK. We are hoping for another good season. I am always the optimist. Luckily I was one of the few people in the South West who had loss of profits insurance which meant I did remarkably well during Covid and I'm quite happy.""

Rather than considering retirement he has big plans and has bought new properties in Torquay town centre which he is converting into flats. He is also ploughing ""many millions of pounds"" into three major projects in Torquay. He has bought the former Torbay Magistrates Court building in higher Union Street and is converting it into 14 housing units. Mr Richardson has also acquired the iconic Municipal Chambers opposite Torquay Town Hall. He is spending another million refurbishing that building with its round tower to create 12 apartments.

At the same time he is working with Torbay Council on is biggest project - the modernisation of the seafront Grand Hotel in Torquay. He wants to go ahead with plans to raise the roof which were given planning permission in 2007 and add a new top story with between 35 and 38 apartments.

On top of that he envisions a 'glass box' restaurant with stunning views across the whole of Torbay. To help finance the scheme he wants to demolish the dilapidated garage block at the rear opposite Torquay Railway Station and replace it with 20 new cottages. And his final dream is to redesign the ugly rear entrance from the railway station making it as ""beautiful and elegant"" as the white hotel front overlooking Corbyn Head.

DXCM,Dexcom,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzAyL2N1c3RvbWVycy1sb3ZlLXRoZXNlLTMtaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1jb21wYW5pZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Customers Love These 3 Healthcare Companies,"Net Promoter Scores can provide insights into customer satisfaction and possibly lead to market-beating returns.

Trying to predict where the market will go over the short term is next to impossible. But when you're searching for potentially profitable places to park your hard-earned cash you might want to start by considering companies with particularly happy customers. With this in mind let's look at three companies that clearly do please their customers based on a metric called the Net Promoter Score (NPS).

NPS is a metric that's based on people's responses to a single survey question along these lines: ""On a scale of 0 to 10 how likely would you be to recommend this company product or service to a friend or colleague?"" That key question is usually followed up with a question or three attempting to gauge why each respondent gave the answer that they did.

But it's that first question that counts. Those who respond with a 9 or 10 are classified as ""promoters"" -- customers who will keep coming back and more importantly who will enthusiastically recommend the business to others. Those whose answers are 6 or lower are the ""detractors"" -- folks who will disparage the company or its products. Subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters and you get the Net Promoter Score.

Obviously higher scores are better. They range from -100 to +100 and if a business's NPS is a negative number that's a problem. Any positive number though is at least good. According to the management consultants at Bain & Co. which invented the NPS a score above 20 is favorable above 50 is great and an 80 or above is world class.

And this gauge of customer loyalty also tends to forecast business growth -- which brings us to three healthcare companies that are overwhelmingly pleasing their customers based on this metric: 1Life Healthcare (ONEM) with an NPS of 90; Dexcom's (DXCM 1.00%) which scored an 83; and FIGS (FIGS -3.77%) which scored an 81.

1Life Healthcare

1Life Healthcare which does business under the name One Medical is keeping patients thrilled with its primary-care medical practices as evidenced by its eye-popping NPS of 90. The membership-based primary care platform grew its total member count by 34% in 2021 to 736000. In the process it grew its full-year revenue by 64%. And with such a high NPS it's no wonder One Medical's membership plans have a better than 90% retention rate.

The company helps keep its patients in above-average health too. Its offices were ranked first by the New York City Health Department for viral load suppression among HIV patients (a measure of controlled disease). One Medical's mental health services have been shown to drive a 50% reduction in severe anxiety. In diabetic patients One Medical's patients have reductions in average blood glucose levels that are twice what others have shown in publications. Clearly its model seems to be working well for patients.

The combination of quality healthcare and satisfied customers has driven growth and that's expected to continue. The company expects to end 2022 with 14% more members than at the beginning of the year and sees full-year net revenue landing in the $1.045 billion to $1.085 billion range -- roughly 70% higher than in 2021.

Despite all that growth Wall Street doesn't seem to appreciate the model. One Medical's shares are down almost 40% year to date -- and by almost 80% from their February 2021 peak -- making this stock an interesting watch list candidate.

Dexcom

Medical device company Dexcom also has a strong fanbase. Its popular G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system recently earned an NPS of 83 among the diabetic patients who use it. Those happy patients have led to ecstatic investors. Dexcom's shares are up by more than 500% in the last five years -- and by more than 4900% in the last 10 years.

Despite its size -- its market cap is in the neighborhood of $51 billion -- Dexcom continues to expand. Total revenue grew 23% in 2021 and in foreign markets sales grew by 54%. With the omicron COVID-19 surge largely in the rear-view mirror its sales force is starting to make it back into medical offices further driving device uptake. In addition the competition seems to be stumbling. In December rival Medtronic received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration regarding faults with its insulin pumps.

Adding to DexCom's tailwinds the American Diabetes Association recently stated that CGM can be useful for people with diabetes who require multiple daily injections of insulin. This almost doubles Dexcom's addressable market in the U.S. from 4 million to about 7 million. And the company believes new geographies will more than triple its total addressable market by the second half of 2023. In addition the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now estimates that 38% of adults in America -- 96 million people -- have pre-diabetes. Between that and over 40% of U.S. adults reporting undesired weight gain since the start of the pandemic the potential market for Dexcom is significant.

FIGS

Healthcare outfitter FIGS frequently draws comparisons to athleisure apparel maker Lululemon Athletica (LULU -1.38%) thanks to its stylish scrubs. And based on FIGS' NPS of 81 and Lululemon's score of 83 both companies are doing an excellent job of pleasing their customers. And scrubs maker FIGS has the growth to prove it.

With net revenue up 62% to $420 million in 2021 FIGS is firing on all cylinders. Its active customer base grew 46% to 1.9 million last year and net revenue per active customer rose by $22 year-over-year and by $39 over the last two years. It also increased its repeat customer revenues to 68% up from 62% in 2020. Plus its fledgling international business -- currently its only foreign markets are the U.K. Canada and Australia -- tripled in 2021 providing 7% of revenue. Management plans to enter new markets in 2022.

FIGS knows its customers well. It actually tailors its site to offer more personalized content to its consumers resulting in a higher conversion rate. In the fourth quarter these personalized experiences resulted in a conversion rate that was almost twice what it had been before it began using tailored content. Half of its new customers come back and buy again within a year. And if buyers purchase from FIGS in two consecutive years they are likely to stay loyal -- over 95% of those customers purchase from it again in year three.

Companies with high Net Promoter Scores are worth a second look

While a Net Promoter Score certainly isn't the only way to measure the outlook for a stock a strong number should certainly get investors' attention.

Companies whose scores are far higher than those of their peers have tended to well reward their shareholders over the years. While the market and individual share prices will always fluctuate a high NPS indicates the type of brand loyalty that can outlive short-term volatility.

Given how well they are satisfying their customers FIGS Dexcom and One Medical deserve consideration for investors' watch lists.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzaHViLmNvLm56L2hvbWUvcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMi8wNC91cHBlci1odXR0LWRhZC1zLXBsZWEtdG8tcGhhcm1hYy10by1jb3Zlci1mYW1pbHktcy01MjAwLWEteWVhci1iaWxsLWZvci1saWZlLWNoYW5naW5nLWRpYWJldGVzLWRldmljZXMuaHRtbNIBnwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzaHViLmNvLm56L2hvbWUvcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMi8wNC91cHBlci1odXR0LWRhZC1zLXBsZWEtdG8tcGhhcm1hYy10by1jb3Zlci1mYW1pbHktcy01MjAwLWEteWVhci1iaWxsLWZvci1saWZlLWNoYW5naW5nLWRpYWJldGVzLWRldmljZXMuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Upper Hutt dad's plea to Pharmac to cover family's $5200 a year bill for 'life-changing' diabetes devices,"A Kiwi teacher is calling for public funding for ""life-changing"" diabetes devices after being forced to stump up $200 a fortnight for basic care for him and his daughter.

Jared Summers is the Deputy Principal of Birchville School in Upper Hutt. He and his six-year-old daughter Sophie both have type 1 diabetes - an autoimmune condition which means the body doesn't create any insulin (or only very little amounts).

Summers spent most of his life managing his condition through finger prick blood sugar tests but after Sophie was diagnosed as a toddler he and his wife Rachel saved up to purchase a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).

A CGM attaches to the arm or stomach and gives an accurate blood glucose level in seconds through a digital sensor. It also shows whether levels are dropping or rising allowing users to prevent them going too high or low which can have serious consequences.

The CGM has been life-changing for Summers and his daughter. But there's a catch: the device is not funded by the Government and the basic version costs the family $200 a fortnight for both - an expense of $5200 each year.

Summers says he's very fortunate to be able to afford it but Kiwis who can't finance the device themselves shouldn't miss out.

""As a teacher I am on the go all the time and now I can just wave my phone over my arm and see my blood sugars rather than taking 30 seconds to a minute out to do a blood sugar check on my finger"" Summers told Newshub.

For Sophie the impacts have been even more pronounced. Not only has it allowed her the freedom to enjoy being a kid it's also given Summers and his wife peace of mind at night.

""When she was diagnosed we didn't have the CGM and she can't tell when she's going low. If I have a low in the night I wake myself up - my body knows - whereas she doesn't know those signs yet.",,,,,,,,,

The idea behind the process is fairly simple: heated water from a datacenter can be used to boost waste water processing cutting energy requirements for that while some of the treated water then becomes cooling water for the datacenter.

In Korea Tomorrow Water has now signed a memorandum of understanding with Samsung Dohwa Engineering and BNZ Partners to jointly develop integrated datacenter and sanitation infrastructure solutions based on this process which the firm calls Co-Flow.

Tomorrow Water already has a partnership in the US with Arcadis a sustainable design and engineering consultancy firm to evaluate the Co-Flow process and develop similar datacenter colocation projects there.

So if you ever thought that the internet was a sewer you may soon not be far wrong.

According to Tomorrow Water Co-Flow was developed as part of the company's broader initiatives to colocate and interconnect infrastructure elements such as wastewater treatment renewable energy generation and datacenter capacity. The aim is to capitalize on their complementary energy heat nutrient and water inputs and outputs to make them more sustainable and affordable to the global population it says.

Part of the solution is BKT's Proteus wastewater treatment technology which the firm has already used to modernize a wastewater treatment facility at the Jungnang Water Recycling Center in Seoul. This reduced the plant's total footprint by 60 percent according to Tomorrow Water and the resulting freed up space is where datacenter buildings could be constructed if the process were to be replicated at other sites.

Demand for datacenter space is growing particularly in the US but elsewhere in the world as well. However according to Tomorrow Water meeting that demand is being thwarted by the lack of useable sites for datacenter construction in urban centers. Co-Flow creates a win-win scenario by enabling datacenters to be developed within the existing footprint of sewage treatment works while also saving water and energy.

Elsewhere for one example Microsoft has partnered with Finland's largest energy company to build a new datacenter near Helsinki that will heat homes as it cools servers by moving waste datacenter heat via existing water pipes to homes and businesses in the surrounding cities of Espoo and Kauniainen as well as the municipality of Kirkkonummi. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL1RlbGVjb21tdW5pY2F0aW9uL05UVC10aWVzLXVwLXdpdGgtQXVzdHJhbGlhbi1mdW5kLU1hY3F1YXJpZS1pbi1kYXRhLWNlbnRlci1pbnZlc3RtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NTT ties up with Australian fund Macquarie in data center investment,"TOKYO -- Nippon Telegraph and Telephone is partnering with Australia's Macquarie Asset Management to jointly own data centers in Europe and the U.S. so that the Japanese telecommunications giant need not shoulder the entire investment alone amid booming global demand.

Digital real estate in the virtual metaverse is the hottest property on the market and tipped to be worth trillions of dollars within just two to three years.

'It's going to be huge' Curtin University digital expert Professor Vidy Potdar predicted. 'People are going to make a lot of money on it.'

It's the new property boom which is set to turn millennials into millionaires - but none of the new homes they're snapping up - like this one - actually exist...and never will

Early adopters are already paying millions to get in on the action to snap up tracts of digital land to build virtual online homes which they will then sell to new users.

Some say that it may already be too late to get on board to make the biggest profits as prices are already starting to soar worldwide.

But others predict even a small investment now could pay huge dividends - and may be enough to put down the deposit on a real home...or even buy it outright.

'Some might see it as owning something that doesn't actually exist - but the more savvy ones will see it as a very big investment' says Sydney-based metaverse developer Colina Demirdjian.

'Ultimately if you're getting in early it becomes an investment that can grow exponentially quicker than owning a real home in the in the real world.'

In the US the Sandbox metaverse has seen virtual land prices soar from US$25 for a plot to US$30000 after rap star Snoop Dog moved in and set up a presence.

Digital real estate developer Everyrealm paid a staggering US$4.3 million for a tract of land in Sandbox too a record amount in the sector which is dominated by Sandbox Decentraland Cryptovoxels and Somnium.

The virtual property bubble is exploding on the back of massive investments by Bitcoin millionaires who made huge cryptocurrency profits after small investments a few years ago turned into life-changing fortunes.

They are now ploughing their cash into the newly-emerging metaverses in the hope of repeating their digital speculation success.

It has been further fuelled by Facebook's parent company rebranding as Meta and founder Mark Zuckerberg pledging to invest massively in the virtual world.

UN-REAL ESTATE Futurist Mark Pesce warns the virtual world is all about perceived value only. 'I call it un-real estate' the honorary associate of University of Sydney's digital cultures program. 'It's a property deed to a place that doesn't exist in the real world. It's only redeemable in that particular plot. So it's like a store credit that you can only spend in one store. 'You might be able to get someone else to buy it - but that's basically it. 'The idea of where it gets its value from and how it holds that value is based entirely on how much bubbling ferment there is around a particular metaverse - and how much they can stir up people to make them think that these places are valuable.'

Most importantly for many millennials is the ability to reinvent yourself into any form you like without the need for cosmetic surgery as a tweaked version of their real-life form or a complete transformation.

The worlds will be accessed by augmented reality glasses - where the real world and virtual world can merge seamlessly - or virtual reality headsets which immerse users completely in their artificial world.

But all that immersion will come at a price - and experts are predicting the values of virtual possessions will soar on the back of increasing demand and deliberate limitations to preserve value.

Everything will be for sale in the virtual worlds too - from virtual homes to virtual gadgets to virtual furniture and most especially virtual fashion.

The commercial side of the metaverse has already attracted global brands like Nike and JP Morgan who are setting up presences at the centre of metaverse world - which in turn drives up the value of virtual homes near the virtual CBDs.

Colina Demirdjian and her identical twin Hripsy are in the process of applying the finishing touches to their own metaverse Diverse created by their Sydney-based app company Double Trouble.

The former law students made a fortune in their 20s through a mobile phone app that created lifelike cartoon avatars and they are now ploughing the profits back into their new virtual universe.

It's projected to be home to 30 million users with land prices already starting at $10000 - and they are passionate advocates of the brave new online world.

'Last year alone virtual real estate was worth $500 million in sales and this year it's expected to hit $1 billion' said Colina.

She believes many companies will intertwine the real world with the digital world - and give you a virtual version of anything you order in the real world to have in your metaverse... and vice-versa.

TITLE DEEDS OR NFTS Underpinning the virtual world are NFTs - non-fungible tokens - which are digital assets with ownership logged by blockchain. Blockchains are complex algorithms which keep a secure log of digital items and who paid for them. But they are essentially only a digital receipt - and because of the very nature of the internet they do not give the owners copyright of their digital asset which requires copies to be transmitted over the internet. 'There was a case a couple of months ago of some folks who bought the NFT of a script draft of an early version of sci-fi movie Dune' revealed futurist Mark Pesce. 'They thought that actually gave them rights to produce a Dune film. 'They really had no idea that just because they owned this NFT that they didn't actually own the copyrights to the source material.' But Colina Demirdjian compares NFTs to collectible trading cards which can often dramatically increase in value. 'There's a mindset shift that needs to be done for the general public' she says. 'When you are buying something in the digital space you are owning something of value. 'It's not tangible but it's still valuable. You can buy something keep it collect similar things or sell it someone else. 'And it may give you prestige or access to certain groups or communities or it can substantially increase in value. 'And it's yours to do with whatever you like.' Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/mx/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_2 - ->

McDonalds have already begun work on creating a metaverse restaurant which will deliver whatever you order in the virtual world to your real world front door.

Adidas Samsung and Coca Cola have also been quick to get in at ground level to expand their brands into the new online worlds.

Colina sees a day where you could buy an outfit at Big W - and instantly have the same clothes available in your virtual wardrobe too.

Likewise furniture from Temple and Webster or a television from Harvey Norman - or you could test drive owning a fishtank online before taking the plunge for real.

The biggest challenge for metaverse creators is attracting users and then making them stay - and Diverse aims to do it by making dreams come true.

'We want to make it better than life' said Colina. 'We plan on allowing everyone to live out their dream lifestyle and live their best life.

'We want to bring a lot of realism where people can connect with individuals and inhabit a new land and just enjoy what we can do with technology.'

Professor Vidy Potdar says there will be an even simpler reason people will log in.

'It's fun!' he insisted. 'It's a place you can go when you can't go anywhere.

'You can meet new people in the metaverse which you otherwise would not meet in real world.

'It's a different kind of experience for people and especially the younger crowd. They want to try something new.'

He added: 'We are just at the beginning of what could be something really big and something quite transforming going into the future.

'We are at that initial stage the hype stage at the moment where everyone is kind of excited. There is a lot of investment that is being poured into the startups currently.'

Others are more sceptical - but say if you are lucky enough to have some money you can afford to lose completely it could be worth a gamble.

But they warn the window may already have closed on making massive money.

'I would not advise people to make this investment' said Sydney futurist Mark Pesce.

'If someone wants to take a punt and spend a couple bucks or even 100 bucks because it's a risky investment - and maybe it'll pay off big someday but maybe it'll go to zero - then there's no problem.

'If you go in knowing all of that then you're an informed investor and it's your own money. You're a grown up and you can make your own decisions.

Futurist Mark Pesce honorary associate of University of Sydney's digital cultures program warns the virtual world is only about perceived value

'But if someone is naive and being told ""Oh my god! There's real estate here! You can make a real estate investment! You can afford it! It's going to appreciate...""

'Then that's probably crossing a line...'

He added: 'It is no longer early in terms of Metaverse land pricing.

'It's not like Bitcoin which is probably at the top of its market now - but it's not early and my gut feeling is that it's already too late to make the really big profits.'

Either way Colina insists it's the future.

'It's going to be the next world' she says. 'It's the internet but it's web three. We're making a transition from 2D to 3D

'So if you want to be like socially and culturally cool you will need to be in the metaverse.

'It's not going to happen on your phone. It's no longer going to happen on Instagram. People are looking for more immersive realism and escapism.

'You want to wear beautiful clothes you want to buy beautiful property. This is going to be the place where you'll have all those dreams come to life.

'And that's why the investment is going to be huge.'

Former law students Colina and Hripsy Demirdjian made a fortune in their 20s through a mobile phone app that created lifelike cartoon avatars like these ones of themselves seen here",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vcmVhbHR5Yml6bmV3cy5jb20vcWEtd2l0aC1qb3JkYW4tZmxldGNoZXItcHJlc2lkZW50LW9mLWdvcmdlLWhvbGRpbmdzLWluLXN0LWNhdGhlcmluZXMvOTg3Njk0OTcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Q&A With Jordan Fletcher President of Gorge Holdings in St CathArines,"We recently interviewed Jordan Fletcher the president of Gorge Holdings Inc. a real estate development company based in the St. CathArines area of Ontario.

Q: First of all can you give us an overview of your position with Gorge Holdings and what your company does?

Jordan Fletcher: Absolutely. I started with Gorge Holdings as a property manager in 2006. We have always focused on a variety of real estate projects and developments with a mix of commercial retail residential and industrial developments — all in southern Ontario.

In addition to St. CathArines of course where we’re based Gorge also has developments in

Niagara Falls Welland Thorold London and Niagara on the Lake.

I was chosen for president of the company in 2010. In the 10-plus years since I have worked hard to expand our portfolio. That’s been accomplished mostly through acquisitions and developing new properties. The goal is to continue diversifying our portfolio by finding great new opportunities in these cities which I think will continue to provide many great opportunities in the coming years.

Q: Southern Ontario is one of the hottest real estate markets in Canada which continues to have competitive housing markets throughout the country. What are the major trends you see for the country’s real estate market this year?

Jordan Fletcher: That’s a great question. Although the pandemic slowed everything down for awhile that really didn’t last as long as many of us feared. Commercial real estate especially bounced back pretty quickly last year and has continued to improve ever since.

Commercial real estate is in a good place and residential isn’t far behind. Morguard actually released a recent report that forecast more growth for commercial real estate in Canada this year. They wrote that investment stayed strong in 2021 for both industrial real estate and multi-suite rentals.

That bodes well for 2022 when we’re already seeing an economic rebound from the pandemic. The economy is expected to expand output by about 5 percent and both the services sector and labour market should strengthen this year as well. Given that Canada in general — and Ontario especially — remains a highly desirable place to live and work I think there’s room for success for Gorge Holdings.

Q: What kinds of projects is Gorge Holdings working on right now? Can you share any details with us?

Jordan Fletcher: I can share a few details sure. Here in St. CathArines we’re trying to meet the city’s need for more residential developments. We own a parking lot on Ontario Street between Church Street and King Street. It’s a one-acre lot that we think is in a fantastic location for new residences.

We’re still in the planning stages for this project but we’re looking at building a luxury rental building that would consist of approximately 150 units. We want to offer everything with this: protected parking storage space you name it. The area continues to grow and add new workers — and they’re going to need a place to live in an area with very low vacancy rates.

We also plan on making the first floor commercial to accommodate a variety of businesses and services.

Q: Is Gorge Holdings primarily pursuing developments in St. St CathArines right now? Or do you have projects elsewhere as well?

Jordan Fletcher: Of course! We’re active throughout Southern Ontario. In fact we have two developments in Welland right now one industrial development in Thorold and a residential building in London.

We’re working on a new location in Welland for 25 residential building lots. It’s in an ideal location for new people moving into the city. It’s just a block away from Niagara Street which has many local businesses restaurants and cafes and retail stores and services.

We just recently completed a new commercial plaza with a number of different services and shopping opportunities. Gorge has actually owned the property for several years and with the growth in the area the timing was right to build a new plaza that attracted new local and national tenants including Starbucks Sleep Country and national quick serve food stores.

We are also adding a new Industrial complex in Thorold located just off highway 406. Construction for this project has just started and we look forward to expanding our existing footprint in that market. The project will consist of 3 multi unit buildings totalling 80000 square feet.

The London multi unit residential building is about 80% complete. We are very excited to finalize the development of these 60 luxury rental suites. It’s in a great location in North London and the project ios coming along great!

Q: Overall it sounds like you have a positive outlook for the real estate business this year. Jordan Fletcher: I think there’s a lot to be excited about yes. It’s a great time to be in real estate and I think Ontario is one of the best places anywhere to be doing it. I’m really looking forward to finding new opportunities to grow and I’m confident that Gorge Holdings has a lot of great work ahead of us."

Cinnaire a community building company supported the development of the new 100000-square-foot-building with a New Markets Tax Credit investment.

The financial services technology building is expected to be completed by November of this year. The University’s President Dennis Assanis is asking the state legislature for $6.5 million to furnish and equip the establishment.

Assanis stated “Construction of the building is only the first step. It needs about $14 million in fit-out-in partitions and cabling in wiring and furnishings in other work to make it suitable for occupancy and to have the labs that we need in the building.”

Three million dollars has already been provided by the state through the Higher Education Economic Development Fund along with $4.5 million from industry partners.

This new space on campus will serve as an economic driver for the state. According to Assanis “The extensive investments that the university is making are helping to drive progress in healthcare in engineering in business and many other areas that would benefit Delawareans today and for many years to come.”

The building is owned by the Delaware Technology Park (DTP) and will hold a partnership along with UD and Discover Bank. DTP will fund it with a below-market-rate loan from Discover.

Other tenants will include NIIMBL workforce development; Discover Bank; the Kendal Corporation a senior living company; Financial Health Network a nonprofit research organization; The Venture Center a national Fintech incubator; Tech Impact a nonprofit digital workforce development organization; RAAD360 a supply chain IT startup; and Grain Exchange a new restaurant from Grain Craft Bar + Kitchen.

For Muscatine County residents though New Horizons a part of UnityPoint Trinity Muscatine offers outpatient substance abuse services close to home.

New Horizons offers a variety of services to assist people dealing with substance abuse. Their nine fulltime staff members including two prevention specialists can assist adolescents and adults in a number of ways. Patients seeking treatment start with a substance abuse evaluation which lets New Horizons staff determine the right level of care for them. They can then enroll the patient in their intensive outpatient program if appropriate. They can also provide individual and group counseling depending on the patient’s needs and help them determine the frequency of counseling that would benefit them most. To make sure that patients can keep up with their treatment plans New Horizons offers morning afternoon and evening programming to work around people’s work and family schedules.

While working with New Horizons patients will receive case management to help them determine when they can step down to a less intensive level of care and to help connect them to community resources such as physical and mental healthcare providers transportation other community services and support groups they can continue to work with even after they complete their treatment. If a patient does not speak English New Horizons can provide them with an interpreter who speaks just about any language.

New Horizons offers additional substance abuse related services as well. They can perform drug tests and urinalysis for people who need them to comply with a court order for employment or as part of routine workplace testing for people in certain careers. They also provide substance abuse prevention education throughout the community.

To make substance abuse treatment available to as many people as possible New Horizons strives to keep their services affordable. They accept all major insurers including Medicare and Medicaid. Additionally they provide services on a sliding fee scale based on a patient’s income. If a patient does not have insurance and has trouble affording their care New Horizons can assist them in finding financial help.

Brook Brown a prevention specialist with New Horizons has seen through her work the importance of having substance abuse treatment programs in cities of all sizes. “Our services benefit the community because substance abuse doesn’t just affect the persons themselves it affects their friends and family” she said.

New Horizons located at 1605 Cedar Street Suite B in Muscatine just across from UnityPoint Trinity Muscatine Hospital can take walk-in patients Monday through Thursday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Fridays from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Walk ins will receive same day services on a first come first served basis.

A MorningConsult survey conducted shortly after COVID first struck in early 2020 found that 46% of Americans were cooking more.

More time spent in the kitchen means more money spent on the kitchen. Many have been dumping dollars into upgrading their kitchens as well as overhauling their aesthetic. Even those who haven’t been making drastic changes to their cooking spaces may also be dishing out more dough (pun not intended) than they did in pre-pandemic times. So a few bucks here on mason jars and a few bucks there on measuring cups can add up.

With that in mind is shopping at dollar stores the best way to save on kitchen products? It depends. Let’s explore which items are must-buys and which are best bought at more renowned retailers.

Coffee Filters

“Unbleached coffee filters can cost two to three times as much at Walmart and Amazon while bleached ones can reach up to five times pricier than their dollar-store price” said Nunzio Ross founder and CEO at Majesty Coffee. “It’s an essential kitchen item for people who brew their coffees at home and they don’t have to be expensive.”

Mason Jars

“You won’t find a better deal on Mason jars of all sizes anywhere else” said Elyse Moody a kitchen design expert at Designer Appliances. I like buying the really large ones for iced teas and lemonade (or preserved lemons) medium ones for storing tomato sauce and small ones for leftover soups sauces or smoothies.

You can find an extensive variety of low-price Mason jars at Dollar Tree.

Bench Scraper

“You can find stainless steel bench scrapers for $1.25 at Dollar Tree and these are some multi-use tools that many home chefs of all skill levels swear by” said Julie Ramhold consumer analyst at DealNews.com. “These are good for dividing up dough as well as scraping counters down after working with dough or even chopping certain ingredients like homemade pasta.”

Funnel Sets

“Whatever you need them for you can find a 3-pack at dollar stores that will be cheap but effective” Ramhold said.

A 3-pack of plastic funnels goes for $1.25 at Dollar Tree.

Decorative Toothpicks and Forks

“If you enjoy entertaining and having small versions of snack foods for guests to feast on the decorative toothpicks and forks at dollar stores are a great alternative to a standard pack of toothpicks” Ramhold said. “As they’re super affordable you’ll be able to dress up your menu with little effort and cost.”

Packages of decorative toothpicks and forks retail for $1.25 each at Dollar Tree.

Measuring Cups

“One caveat about purchasing measuring cups from dollar stores is that the markings may rub off over time so you may find that you have to replace them” Ramhold said. “Still if you need them for a specific project or don’t mind having to buy more after a time you can’t beat the price.”

A 4-set of measuring cups goes for $1.25 at Dollar Tree.

Bamboo Kitchen Utensils

“Bamboo utensils are more sanitary than plastic and more eco-friendly as well” said Dominic HarperTitle founder of Debt Bombshell. “You don’t even have to worry about the disposal because you can just plant it in your backyard and it will degrade easily making it a very sustainable alternative.”

Glass Drinkware

“You can find glass drinkware for much less than big box stores and specialty kitchen retailers — plus styles are very similar” said budgeting expert Andrea Woroch. “For example you can snag this 20.5 ounce stemless wineglass for $1.25 at the Dollar Tree versus a similar yet smaller version at Target for $3.”

Plastic Storage Containers

“Here’s a 3-count plastic food storage container set from Walmart for $3.72 but you can find a similar option at Dollar Tree for just $1.25 at a savings of nearly $2.50” Woroch said.

Kitchen Items To Avoid Buying at the Dollar Store

Timers

“Specifically the digital timers as the batteries may be hard to replace” Ramhold said. “Sure you can toss that one out and buy another but over time that adds up. Plus timers these days are kind of redundant given that most people can do timers on their smartphones as well as employ smart assistants to keep track for them.”

Vegetable Peelers

“They’re definitely affordable but they’re usually a mix of metal and plastic and there’s a good chance that the plastic parts can break which means you’ll have to toss the whole thing anyway” Ramhold said.

Pizza Cutters

“The design of pizza cutters in general isn’t great and cheese and toppings can get stuck in certain parts but purchasing from dollar stores means you’ll likely be buying one that’s plastic and metal” Ramhold said. “The metal may not be sharp enough to cut your pizza but again if the plastic breaks you’ll have to toss the whole tool.”

Bakeware

“It’ll depend on what they’re made of but you may want to skip bakeware at dollar stores” Ramhold said. “They may not conduct heat well which means you could end up with uneven browning on your baked foods and depending on the quality of nonstick coating you may end up having to do extra greasing when you don’t want to. Additionally these pans are likely to stain really easily so if you care about the look of your bakeware these may not be the best option.”

Oven Mitts

“Prices on oven mitts are tempting at the dollar store but this is one item you should skip because quality will be lacking and can prove to be dangerous” Woroch said. “You won’t have as much protection from home hot surfaces or baking dishes when using cheaply made oven mitts so spend more. One way to save and still get quality is to buy oven mitts from HomeGoods or Marshalls where you get brand name items for up to 60% less.”

Knives

“The knives available at the dollar store are blunt; they can’t even cut through an apple without bending in half” said Johan Liebert shopping expert and CEO at DazzDeals.

Knives are one of those items that are almost always worth spending more on. You can usually find your basics for a decent price but you can always level up (to an insane degree even) by heading over to Williams Sonoma where top-of-the-line knives easily go for over $500.

Graters and Slicers

“For the same reason you want to avoid [dollar store] knives you want to avoid cheaply made graters and slicers because they will be dull and not function to get your food prep done well” Woroch said. “Pick up a brand name better quality option for these kitchen items from Amazon or Walmart to save.”

In a video posted by @babyscribblez which has garnered 422.5K views on the platform the size and count of essential care products like razors and cotton swabs before and after the price increase are shown. Before the increase razors were available in packages of five and cotton swabs in packs of 300. After razors are four to a package and cotton swabs are available in packs of 200 reducing the amount of product by 20% and 33.33% respectively.

When the chain announced in 2021 that it would raise its prices it claimed that the increase would allow for greater quality and variety in its stores. However commenters on the video shared that they had not seen any improvement in their local Dollar Tree locations.

“It’s so sad I thought it was supposed to get us more and better quality with the increase” the poster wrote. “Turns out it’s less in most cases.”

“Finding Walmart has become cheaper than the dollar store on lots of stuff” one commenter wrote.

“The 25¢ increase genuinely killed it for me not even the candy is worth anymore” another commenter wrote.

“I deadass used to go there all the time but now I’ve been once in 6 months” another commenter wrote. “Quality down and prices up = bye.”

Others shared different ways their experiences with Dollar Tree had declined in quality.

“What doesn’t make sense is them selling the hot wheels/matchbox cars for $1.25 and they’re .99 cents everywhere else” another commenter wrote.

“The signs they had posted announcing the new prices all said that they were gonna offer more stuff and every time I go I find less stuff” another commenter wrote.

“The whole craft section is actually trash now” a commenter wrote. “I went in for stickers and all that had was wall decals.”

""As the name says everything here seems to be a dollar more or less. Right? Even though it's not"" said Markus Giesler a professor at the Schulich School of Business at York University.

WATCH: Marketplace's full investigation:

Battle of the dollar store giants Duration 8:15 Is shopping at a dollar store always saving you money? CBC Marketplace put two of Canada's most popular dollar stores to the test: Dollarama and Dollar Tree.

Marketing and store layout may contribute to the perception of the best deal when it may not always be the case.

""The way the merchandise is presented to us is designed to make us buy more than we absolutely need"" Giesler said. ""That's also quite honestly the trap that many consumers fall into. Myself included.""

Dollarama has more than 1400 locations across Canada with products ranging from just under $1 to around $4. The company announced this week that it plans to start selling some items for as much as $5. Dollar Tree has about 230 locations selling goods for $1.25 or $1.50.

What they spent

The test aimed to compare identical items but the stores often sold products in different sizes. In that case the price was broken down per unit.

Froot Loops at Dollar Tree cost $1.25 versus $4 at Walmart and $2 at Dollarama. However the package at Dollar Tree was only 87 grams compared to 345 grams at Walmart and 230 grams at Dollarama; converting to price per unit means the Dollar Tree product ends up costing more per 100 grams.

""There is a discrepancy between what these stores communicate what they message and what they deliver and that's something that's not always known to unassuming consumers"" Giesler said.

Two test shoppers and the Marketplace team went to Dollarama Dollar Tree and Walmart for a list of the same products in toiletries snacks food cleaning supplies toys and pet food — though they found sizes often varied.

Need to compare prices

Giesler said shoppers need to know their size comparisons.

A common tactic at dollar stores he noted is carrying just one type of product — one brand of toothpaste for example — making in-store comparison shopping difficult.

Dollar stores don't typically sell anything for $1 anymore and many of those stores are based in lower-income neighbourhoods with more newcomers to Canada he said.

""Often we're talking about vulnerable consumers lower-income families and families who actually need every penny and need every dollar"" he said.

""They signal 'We make affordability and the Canadian dream happen.'""

Not all dollar stores are equal

In the end Dollarama fared well in Marketplace's test always edging out Dollar Tree on prices and within pennies of Walmart in that comparison of 17 items.

Dollarama sent Marketplace a statement that said it aims to provide competitively priced everyday products at low fixed price points year-round without sales or promotions.

Seven products that were more expensive in a price-per-unit comparison at Dollar Tree were: Froot Loops Pringles KitKat Whiskas Perfect Portion cat food Starburst candies Colgate toothpaste and Crest 3D white toothpaste which worked out to more than $6 per 100 millilitres.

Dollar Tree did have some wins in the Marketplace test: Smarties (at 75 grams as opposed to 45 grams) and Lever 2000 body wash had better prices than its competitors.

In a statement the company wrote that the Crest 3D white toothpaste is considered a travel-sized item and that consumers continue to shop at Dollar Tree for the extreme values they can find.

Two popular kids' items — Hot Wheels cars and Play-Doh containers — were both slightly more expensive at both dollar stores than at Walmart.

""When we walk into a dollar store we're not really thinking of doing the value equation or the mathematics in our head"" said Prof. Mark Lee of Ryerson University's Ted Rogers School of Management.

Instead he said people are ""thinking more about the dollar"" which anchors buyers to a concept that that's not much to spend but shoppers often spend more than intended and rarely leave a dollar store with only one item.

In a pricing win for dollar stores both offered pregnancy tests for $1.25. Walmart had one for more than $8.

All three brands are in Health Canada's database of licensed products approved for efficacy and safety when used as directed.

Dr. Dara Maker a family physician at Women's College Hospital says she recommends dollar store pregnancy tests for her own patients who are trying to conceive.

""If you get a positive dollar store pregnancy test result you are pregnant"" Maker said. ""It is very rare to get a false positive.""

There were some products like one-litre juice boxes for some brands like Minute Maid and Five Alive that were just pennies apart at each store.

Experts said there are things consumers can do to ensure they get a good deal at the dollar store like comparing prices and sizes.

""Do your research whenever you can. Compare and contrast even when the comparison cannot happen on the shelf itself within the aisle"" Giesler said suggesting that price comparison apps can be useful."
D,Dominion Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvcmtib2F0LmNvbS93aW5kL2ZpZ2h0LWVydXB0aW5nLW92ZXItb2Zmc2hvcmUtd2luZC1qb2Jz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fight erupts over offshore wind jobs,"Offshore energy developers and the U.S. maritime industry are locked in a renewed battle over legislation that would give preference to hiring U.S. workers particularly in offshore wind power.

The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022 – ordinarily a calmly bipartisan effort in Congress every two years to approve Coast Guard operations and planning – passed the House of Representatives on Tuesday March 29.

But wrapped inside the package is a section sponsored by Reps. John Garamendi D-Calif. and Garret Graves R-La. that would require new crewing and reporting requirements on operators of foreign-flag vessels working in U.S. waters.

Backed by U.S. maritime companies and labor the sponsors presented their “American Offshore Worker Fairness Act” as a measure to hold energy companies and their contractors closer to the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 – also known as the Jones Act originally built to protect the domestic U.S. maritime industrial base.

“This bipartisan bill closes an egregious Jones Act loophole so that foreign-flagged vessels are held to the same high standards as US-flagged vessels developing our nation’s offshore energy resources including for offshore wind projects” Garamendi said March 2 when the amendment was accepted.

In its campaign for the legislation the Offshore Marine Services Association stressed it would “change the current practice where foreign vessels utilize crewmembers from low-wage countries at day rates no American would or should accept. This unfair practice gives foreign vessels a competitive advantage over U.S. vessels and takes jobs away from American mariners.”

Offshore wind advocates are pushing back hard – and stressing the worldwide shortage of wind turbine installation vessels which they say could hobble development of the U.S. wind industry for years to come.

The new fight erupted as Maersk Supply Service announced it will have a WTIV built in Singapore to install the first phase of the Empire Wind turbine array near approaches to New York Harbor.

Maersk and Empire Wind partners Equinor and BP would work with Kirby Corp. subsidiary Kirby Offshore Wind using newbuild Jones Act-compliant vessels to carry turbine components out to the project site.

Some in the industry contend the proposed crewing provisions will complicate those plans.

Vineyard Wind has a similar arrangement with Foss Maritime for Jones Act-compliant tugs and barges to transport turbine components from shore to a foreign flag WTIV for assembly on the site of that 800-megawatt project off Massachusetts.

“If passed into law this provision would prevent the U.S. from achieving the administration’s target of deploying 30000 MW of offshore wind by 2030” American Clean Power CEO Heather Zichal said in a prepared statement. “As the voice of industry we remain committed to working with the U.S. Senate to stop this anti-jobs provision from being enacted and holding back our nation’s ability to produce more sources of clean homegrown energy.”

Zichal said “the maritime crewing provision as it will cripple the development of the American offshore wind industry.”

It’s a touchy subject for the offshore wind industry. Wind development companies based in Europe are always acutely aware of the higher costs for operating in U.S. waters under the Jones Act. On the other hand developers and U.S. politicians are also closely allied with American labor unions who anticipate many years of work at sea and on shore for their members – in both the maritime and construction trades – if the Biden administration’s goal of 30 gigawatts of wind power moves forward.

One ‘no’ vote on the Coast Guard bill came from Rep. Jake Auchincloss D-Mass. whose Fourth Congressional District borders Rhode Island and the port of New Bedford two centers for offshore wind development.

""Tonight I voted with my district"" said Auchincloss in a statement. ""While I strongly support funding the Coast Guard a hidden provision in this bill would grind offshore wind production to a halt costing thousands of local jobs and impeding our ability to meet President Biden's clean energy goals.""

According to the Offshore Marine Services Association the Garamendi-Graves amendment “would change the current practice where foreign vessels utilize crewmembers from low-wage countries at day rates no American would or should accept.” OMSA says other changes will include:

• Requiring foreign mariners working in the U.S. offshore energy markets secure a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC). Current regulations allow such mariners the option to secure a TWIC while U.S. mariners are required to secure and hold a valid TWIC.

• Limiting the number of visas that can be issued for each foreign vessel operating in U.S. waters and takes steps to ensure that these visas are connected to the mariner’s work on that vessel. Requiring each foreign vessel in U.S. offshore energy markets to prove their ownership structure annually.

• Requiring the U.S. Coast Guard to annually inspect foreign-flagged vessels operating in U.S. offshore energy markets to ensure compliance with these changes.

The Maersk plan for building its WTIV in Singapore is certain to fuel debate over how much offshore wind may benefit the U.S. shipbuilding industry.

The sole U.S.-built WTIV so far the 472’ Charybdis now under construction by Keppel AmFELS in Brownsville Texas has commitments for work beyond owner Dominion Energy’s own 2.6 gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. It’s being closely watched as an indicator of whether other companies will decide to invest around $500 million in another Jones Act-compliant WTIV.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kb21pbmlvbnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMDIvbWNraW5sZXktaW50cm9kdWNlcy1iaWxsLXRvLWFsbG93LWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLWFjdC1hYmFuZG9uZWQtbWluZS1sYW5kcy1tb25leS10by1iZS11c2VkLWZvci1hY2lkLW1pbmUtZHJhaW5hZ2UtcHJvamVjdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McKinley introduces bill to allow infrastructure act Abandoned Mine Lands money to be used for acid mine drainage ...,"MORGANTOWN – Reps. David McKinley R-W.Va. and Matt Cartwright R-Pa. joined to introduce a bill in the U.S. House to ensure that Abandoned Mine Lands funding included in the bipartisan infrastructure bill can be used for acid mine drainage cleanup projects.

The bill is called the STREAM Act: Safeguarding Treatment for the Restoration of Ecosystems from Abandoned Mines.

It addresses an oversight in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which allots $11.3 billion in funding to reclaim abandoned mine lands for 15 years. About $700 million has been allotted for AML projects in West Virginia that will be dispersed over the next five years.

Friends of the Cheat told The Dominion Post about the oversight last week and McKinley’s office explained it. Traditional AML funding allows states to set aside up to 30% of their allotment for long-term operations and maintenance of AMD sites. But the infrastructure act failed to specify that.

This created uncertainty for watershed groups – uncertainty that they could maintain AMD projects if they started them.

This bill fixes the problem by mirroring existing AML law to also allow states to set aside up to 30% of funding for AML restoration projects undertaken with infrastructure act money.

The STREAM Act has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources. Sens Bob Casey D-Pa. and Mike Braun R-Ind. have introduced a sister bill with the same name in the Senate.

The lawmakers note that West Virginia has more than 173000 acres of unreclaimed mine lands – which is more than half the size of New York City – and there are more than 2500 miles of contaminated streams as a result of AMD.

McKinley said “Acid mine drainage from abandoned mines has contaminated creeks and rivers across West Virginia and remediation can require long-term projects. This bill provides states with the flexibility to set aside AML funding specifically for long-term water treatment so that West Virginia can take full advantage of the funding from the hard infrastructure bill.”

He continued. “Significant investments are being made to clean up Abandoned Mine Lands and the acid mine drainage and we want future generations of West Virginians to enjoy clean water for drinking fishing and recreation.”

West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Harold Ward said “West Virginia uses its AMD set-aside account to operate and maintain AML water treatment facilities that have restored over 200 miles of streams and rivers to where they can now support aquatic life. The money in this account is invested which allows the fund to grow while providing the State the ability to build operate and maintain new treatment systems when earnings are sufficient.

“This model allows for the perpetual treatment of impaired waters without placing a financial burden on future generations” he said. “The ability to contribute the federal infrastructure funds to the set-aside account will allow West Virginia to start reviving the miles of streams impaired by AMD from AML sites across the state.”

Casey commented “Without the certainty that funding will be available to cover these long-term costs states will be unlikely to make the necessary investments to restore our vital waterways. This legislation will provide financial certainty for states enabling them to clean up water pollution and in doing so improve property values restore fishing and recreation opportunities create long-term jobs and support local economies that rely on a clean water supply.”

The Dominion Post asked Sens. Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito – both of whom voted for the infrastructure act and supported the AML funding – if they support the STREAM Act. Both said the bill is new and they are still reviewing it.

But he was unaware how the company’s products were made. “I didn’t know sugar went through so much process—I just thought they bagged it up” he says with an easy laugh. “I had to learn how everything works.”

These days Garnett a 62-year-old Baltimore native who lives in Rosedale drives a front-end loader as a raw-sugar operator. Inside the raw-sugar shed he scoops up a mound from the sugar pile with his equipment and places it into a large hopper that holds the sugar until it falls onto a conveyor belt which then transports it to a bucket elevator. From there the sugar moves on to another building—the wash house—to begin the refining process.

After 19 years at the plant Garnett now knows a thing or two about the process and relishes his role as an experienced driver and a union shop steward. “I try to keep everyone doing the right thing” he says genially. “I’m sort of like their leader.” Hence the grandfatherly nickname bestowed upon him. He has also brought his son Terrell into the refinery where he works in the labor pool performing maintenance tasks throughout the plant.

The 10-story Domino Building the main structure in the complex contains the packaging machinery and storage facilities—the last stop before the products go to a warehouse for distribution. It also supports the signature 120-by-70-foot sign on its roof. Unlike the company’s name the grid’s letters spell out “Domino Sugars” with the plural ‘s’ being a holdover from old marketing of the 1950s when the sign was first erected.

Charlotte Hardy who has been a laboratory analyst at the plant for 52 years was honored for her lengthy tenure by being asked to switch on the new sign on Fourth of July last year.

“As we got closer to the day the excitement started to build” says Hardy who analyzes the raw sugar for sucrose content and impurities from the time it arrives at the wash house to the finished product. But then she became nervous especially when she had to stand on a wooden platform on the Domino Building rooftop knowing hundreds of viewers were waiting to see that familiar glow from the iconic symbol. “What if the lights don’t come on?” she remembers thinking. “What if I don’t hit it exactly right?”

She had some reason to be nervous. When the sign started coming down many Baltimoreans worried they were losing a piece of history. But as most of the city knows the illumination went off without a hitch.

Hardy who is 74 and lives in the Towson area began her career at the plant after graduating from Southern High School. At the time she lived in Locust Point where many of the Domino Sugar workers lived (today 18 employees call the community home) and a neighbor told her that Domino Sugar was hiring. She didn’t expect to stay at the company this long but says “I enjoy the work like the people and the benefits are really good—I never saw a reason to leave.”

Inside the Domino Building safety equipment is de rigueur from hard hats and orange reflective vests to safety goggles. And there’s good reason. Like many factories the refinery hasn’t been without its tragedies. A worker was killed in a forklift accident in 2009 an equipment operator died after being doused with calcium hydroxide in 2000 another worker was seriously injured when his arm was caught in machinery in 2012 and in 2007 three employees received minor injuries in an explosion.

On any given day the building is a whir of motion with conveyor belts constantly moving forklifts beeping and sugar—lots of sugar—being poured mechanically into distinctive bright-yellow-and- white containers of all sizes including four-pound plastic tubs made only at the Baltimore plant to 2000-pound sacks destined for commercial bakeries. Small sugar packets churn out upwards of 3000 a minute and 150000 four-pound bags are produced each shift.

Amid the often-deafening noise—ear plugs are a must—the factory also has a familiar odor. At first you can’t quite name it then it hits you: crème brûlée.

Even outside neighbors can pick up the sweet scent. “When the ship is in and there’s wind” says Sam Cogen president of the South Baltimore Neighborhood Association “you can taste and smell sugar in the air.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYXIybmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2RvbWluby1zdWdhci1tYXJrcy0xMDAteWVhcnMtaW4tbG9jdXN0LXBvaW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domino Sugar marks 100 years in Locust Point,"BALTIMORE — A big piece of Baltimore business and culture is now 100 years old.

A plant manager with the company says while the milestone and honoring their past is key; they're also looking towards the future.

""So now we're we're processing 6 million pounds of sugar through the plant on a daily basis. So we're looking for even more ways that we can implement technology so we can take that throughput up even more. So 6 million today may in the next decade be 7 million or 8 million pounds.""

If there ever were a house that salad built this one would be it. Before Jess Damuck author of Salad Freak and her boyfriend Ben Sinclair ever stepped foot into their L.A. Craftsman home another cruciferous vegetable fan was already living there: Julia Sherman aka Salad for President.

But since last year the early-1900s property has been where the pair—Damuck is a food and prop stylist; Sinclair is a multihypenate best known for his HBO show High Maintenance—feed themselves with good design and of course greenery from their robust garden out back.

“It’s been such a good place for transitioning from New York to L.A.” says Damuck who cut her teeth in Manhattan while working for Martha Stewart. Not only is this the first home where she’s ever had a real dining table now she has plenty of opportunities to surround their Same Old pink marble find with the couple’s cool tribe of friends and top it with food they grow in their garden. “I’m just endlessly inspired by the produce here” she says. ”I can reach out the bedroom window and grab a lemon if I need one.”

Sinclair bought the Montecito Heights duplex in 2018 and was renting it out until the pair moved into it last summer and converged their design styles to make it the cheery space it is today. (Any cosmetic changes were thanks to Highground.) “I’ve been letting Jess’s taste influence me for years now” Sinclair says. “Where she is really good with color palette and textures I’m the master of light—I’m the Thomas Kinkade of our relationship.” As in Sinclair would cruise Etsy for Danish-style lamps during work Zoom calls because as he says “that’s the one thing you forget about lamps is what they look like when they’re not on.”

Damuck took the reins on developing a desert-like palette—a back room got a lick of Farrow & Ball’s Citrona and her own painting in the dining room has sunset shades—and from there the two followed their design ethos of mixing circles and square shapes. “For every hard edge there has to be a soft edge to balance it” Damuck says. The result is a place that looks lived-in and not too precious while also being filled with meaningful art (peep the Alex Katz in the living room an upstate procurement) and would-sell-on-Instagram-immediately vintage.

It’s not the huge new-to-L.A. home you might expect from a pair of successful creatives. “I want to give a shoutout to small spaces” Sinclair says of the 1250 square feet they reside in on the bottom floor (though the pair is in the process of remodeling the upstairs so Damuck can have her own test kitchen). “I’ve done a lot of location scouting in L.A. and I’ve seen the sprawling houses here. And I really appreciate that we have to pick and choose our furniture based on the home’s restrictions. I always think it’s so weird when you go to a palatial house and there is a room that no one has ever sat in.”

Instead they’ve curated a thoughtful arrangement of pieces that they guess is 75 percent secondhand (that dining room table!) and 25 percent new like the craft paper nightstands they found on Amazon that mingle with a plaster table in the kitchen that Damuck made herself.

Next up she’s attempting to replicate musician Sia’s plaster chandelier—no really—which the couple calls an inspiration for their own abode. “The warmth that plaster gives to a place is incredible” Damuck says. “The way the light hits it is so beautiful.”

Let’s not forget an important question: how does a self-proclaimed salad freak design her kitchen? Open shelving helps her grab plates as her ingredients are coming together and then there’s the detail that’s more important than their sage green cabinets: the access to the great outdoors a feature that’s especially important to someone who literally wrote the book on eating your greens.

“There’s really nothing like being able to walk out your kitchen door and just go cut some lettuce” Damuck says. And when you really stop and think about it a home is a bit like a salad anyway—a lot of separate ingredients that thanks to a couple with great taste get a little freaky together and in the end make for a heterogeneous mix that just works.

The parade which was canceled in 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic was postponed in March when thunderstorms threatened. Saturday brought a sunny day that welcomed the marchers and spectators alike for more than 90 minutes of bagpipes first responders and other groups celebrating everything Irish.

John F. Lightbody chief of the East Dover Fire Company was grand marshal for the parade and fire companies from around Toms River along with Point Pleasant Lavallette Seaside Heights Seaside Park and others sent engines and other vehicles. New Jersey State Police and Toms River police also participated.

More than a dozen pipes and drums groups delighted the spectators with bagpipe music (you can see them in the video below) and high school marching bands performed as well.

DOW,Dow,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbG9jdXNtYWcuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvYWxleC1icm93bi1yZXZpZXdzLXRoZS1raW5kcmVkLWJ5LWFsZWNoaWEtZG93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alex Brown Reviews The Kindred by Alechia Dow,"The Kindred Alechia Dow (Inkyard Press 978-1-33541-861-6 $18.99 400pp hc) January 2022.

I’ve been on a bit of a science fiction kick lately. Lots of spaceships aliens climate crises and dystopian futures in my to-read queue. So far my favorite book of the bunch is Alechia Dow’s The Kindred. This young-adult novel is set in the same world as her debut The Sound of Stars about a demisexual human and a lab-made alien who pair up to take on the Ilori invaders. Set a few years earlier The Kindred stars Joy Abara a teen from the dirt-poor planet of Hali and the privileged son of royalty Duke Felix Hamdi. In the quasi-prequel the Ilori play a crucial yet largely background role but the novel does way more than just place-setting.

Joy and Felix are Kindred paired at birth by an implanted chip. Through the chip they can communicate telepathically feel each other’s emotions share dreams and even see what the other sees. Ostensibly the Kindred system was meant to unite ancient enemies and keep the peace but that hasn’t slowed the widening gap of class disparities. Due to their social stations – not to mention political scheming by adults in the royal circle – Joy and Felix are prohibited from seeing each other. Felix is content to waste his life as a wannabe musician and aimless playboy while Joy is about to be married off to a man she dislikes in order to fulfill her planet’s repopula­tion requirements.

Their plans are torn apart when Felix’s royal relations are abruptly assassinated and he and Joy are framed for their deaths. The two teens flee in a spaceship aiming for sanctuary on a nearby neutral planet but instead crashland on Earth. Despite the dark themes underscoring the novel Dow keeps things light and playful. In between attempts to repair their damaged ship and hide from scouts sent by the new ruler to capture them the aliens play dress-up attend cheer practice and make friends with the local high school students. Things get messy as their enemies multiply and conspiracies are revealed. Given what we know of the state of our planet in The Sound of Stars we know there is no happy ending for Earth but Joy and Felix’s fates will be decided not by the people trying to destroy them but by the choices the teens make.

Much to my delight The Kindred is wonder­fully queer. Although the terms are not explicitly used context clues point to Joy being under the asexual umbrella (probably demi) and Felix being pansexual or bisexual. Several other secondary characters fly the rainbow flag as well. It feels so well natural. I love it when characters get to exist as queer no coming out no drawn out explanations no bigotry no hiding in the closet. They get to be unapologetically themselves.

The science fiction premise and queer themes merge. A Kindred relationship is a fictional equiva­lent of a queerplatonic relationship. The bond Joy and Felix share is bigger than sexual or romantic and deeper than friendship. They are partners in a committed relationship regardless of marital status. The way the humans struggle to comprehend the whole Kindred thing reminded me so much of how cisallohet people often struggle to comprehend queerplatonic relationships. They exist outside the traditional parameters of romantic sexual or platonic relationships. Put another way queerpla­tonic relationships have queered the very concept of relationships.

Fat main characters are a rarity in fiction both adult and YA/children’s even more so in speculative fiction. With Joy Dow explores the intersectional­ity of identities. Joy loves her dark skin and tightly curled hair. On Earth she is assumed to be of the Black diaspora and is lovingly guided into our cul­ture by Black human characters. In her home empire people try to shame her for being fat and push weight loss on her. They treat her like her weight directly correlates to her worth as a person. Her weight isn’t commented on during her time on Earth; her new friends help her find fun clothing that shows off her figure. Here she gets to not just be Black not just a Black woman not just a queer Black woman but a fat queer Black woman. She carries all of those identities at once. It’s not that Earth is presented as an ideal or that bigotries and prejudices are ignored but that Dow frames it so the reader can see Earth as a place with potential to be better.

The Kindred snuck up on me. I was expecting a heavy sci-fi drama and instead got a story full of joy and hope. It’s the kind of story where teens who never see themselves on the page will walk away feeling validated and teens who always see them­selves on the page will have a better understanding of other experiences. It was so good I can’t wait to go back and read The Sound of Stars.

The Gadget Agents competed at H.H. Dow High School in the Midland FIRST Robotics Qualifier on Saturday March 26.

The FIRST competitions generally consist of teams designing robot to play pre-designed game in a match competition. Each team has build team programming team and marketing team that helps to bring their respective projects together.

The Gadget Agents roster consists of:

Team Captain Luke Rau

Build Team: Luke Rau Neil Finnerty Parker Sienkiewicz Benjamin Straus Harmony Schafer Liam Fox and Daniel Perreault. Safety Captain Chase Wezensky.

Programming Team/Drivers: Grant Hall Ben Gottschaulk Bradley “Trip” Bellinger.

Marketing Team: Addison Doyle Kayne Isaac.

The Beal City team was able to make it to the quarter final round and were the 6th seed Alliance Captains. They selected teams The RoboKings 6753 from Midland and The Cybertronic Lancers 6087 from Ellsworth as their alliance partners.

The Gadget Agents and their Alliance Partners were able to defeat the 3rd seed Alliance and move on to the Semifinals where they were able to upset the 2nd seed Alliance and went on to face the 1st seed Alliance in the finals match where they lost the first match by 1 point and the 2nd match by 10 points.

“To say this is an incredible achievement for our team is an understatement” Beal City Robotics Team Coach Kathleen Rau said. “Our team is currently ranked 112th in the state out of 459 teams. In our finals match we faced Hemlock’s Gray Matter an amazing and well established team that is ranked 10th in the state so it was a huge achievement to have such a close match with them. This is the first time Beal City’s Gadget Agents have made it to a finals match and they were elated to bring home some medals and hardware to put in the trophy case.”

Also during the competition Beal City Schools was recognized by FIRST as being one of few schools throughout the state that has a Pre-K through High School Robotics program.

“That is 100% the result of the work of Ms. Jennifer Courtright” Rau said. “Jen’s dedication to making sure these programs thrive in Beal City surely needs to be recognized. She’s written many grants that have funded the supplies and equipment not only for the Gadget Agents but for our FTC PegaCyborgs and all of our Lego League teams.”

Th Beal City will compete again Walled Lake from April 8-10 and then hope to move on to the state championship.

“The first 160 teams move on to states” Rau said. “We want to thank everyone who made the event at H.H. Dow possible and all the teams we worked with and competed against for a great weekend of match play.”

Elon Musk’s ongoing legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission has a new player — rapper Eminem.

Musk’s lawyer Alex Spiro quoted Eminem’s 2002 song “Without Me” in the latest effort to overturn a 2018 agreement which requires the billionaire to gain pre-approval for certain tweets.

“The [SEC] won’t let me be or let me be me so let me see” part of the filing reads. “They tried to shut me down …”

The original lyrics had FCC instead of SEC. The Federal Communications Commission dropped a $7000 fine in 2002 against a Colorado radio station for playing an Eminem song containing profanity.

A 2018 agreement with the SEC requires that Musk gain pre-approval from other Tesla executives prior to posting tweets about the company.

After Musk asked his Twitter followers last November if he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla triggering a stock selloff the electric vehicle company received a subpoena from the SEC — which the CEO has called “harassment.”

In March in response to Musk challenging the subpoena an SEC regulator urged a federal judge to allow his tweets to continue to be scrutinized.

“Musk’s motion to quash is procedurally defective and substantively meritless” the SEC said.

A few days later Musk tweeted that he is giving “serious thought” to creating his own social media platform claiming Twitter does not uphold principles of free speech.

Concerns about Musk’s first amendment rights were clear in this filing as well.

“The First Amendment requires that agencies proceed with caution when constitutional rights are at stake not seek to pursue any and all novel theories that broaden their authority at the cost of individual freedom” Spiro wrote in the court filing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL3Bob3Rvcy9zbGlkZXNob3cvU0VFTi1HcmFjZS1BLURvdy1NZW1vcmlhbC1MaWJyYXJ5LXNldC10by1yZW9wZW4tMjMzNTI5LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SEEN: Grace A.

The pillar of the business was Vera Rancifer a Pensacola pioneer and icon who passed away March 26 at the age of 94.

Rancifer was known as ""Momma Vera"" because of the care and support she provided for the community.

The Rev. John Powell who runs the Truth for Youth nonprofit across the street from The Dwarf remembers her as a woman ""full of love"" for her family and community.

""Anybody who had an opportunity to meet her had to fall in love because she was going to contaminate you with her infectious love"" Powell said. ""And she loved Pensacola and she loved the community where she lived.""

Rancifer was from Bagdad and spent the majority of her life in Pensacola raising six children. In 1963 she established The Dwarf Chicken Stand at first called The Dwarf Drive Inn which was located on Belmont Street in a small shack where Five Sisters Blues Café currently stands.

The business took its name from the shack's small size. The surrounding area known as ""The Blocks"" was lined with clubs and businesses up and down the street. People would come to The Dwarf for a late-night meal since it was open until 5 a.m.

The Dwarf has long been an institution in Pensacola and many natives will swear you won't find better fried chicken anywhere else. But beyond just the quality of her food Rancifer is remembered for the compassion she showed as a person.

Powell remembers Rancifer using her cooking to support people in need from cooking and catering for local families to offering the eateries extra food to the homeless.

Jennifer Jones-Butler a niece of Rancifer said her aunt lived out her faith in God every day and showed love and caring to people in part by putting love and caring into the food she made.

The community supported her in return.

""You just wonder 'How can her well never be dry?'"" Jones-Butler said. ""Because she always puts back into somebody else. And when you put something good into others you really feed into yourself.""

When Hurricane Ivan flattened the area in 2004 The Dwarf closed briefly then reopened at a Massachusetts Avenue location. However the restaurant came home to Belmont-DeVillers in 2014 opening at 407 N. DeVilliers St. a short distance form its original location.

Rancifer handed the ownership to her niece Venisa ""NeeSee"" Jones-Lutley who has been working at the restaurant since she was a teenager.

Rancifer taught her how to be a business minded-person knowing her niece wanted to learn how to be independent and make money for herself.

To this day Jones-Lutley still feels lucky and overwhelmed that out of all of the kids she was chosen to take care of The Dwarf.

Jones-Lutley said she visited Rancifer on her death bed and told her aunt she still couldn't believe she had been able to establish and maintain a restaurant when the chicken sandwiches were only $1.

Her aunt looked at her and said ""I made it and you will too"" and gave her niece a high five.

Rancifer was laid to rest Friday in Bagdad.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20va2FuZy10aW1lLXRyYXZlbC1tYXJ2ZWwtdW5pdmVyc2UtaHVtYW4tdG9yY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kang the Conqueror is the Secret Origin of Marvel's Very First Hero,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20va2FuZy10aW1lLXRyYXZlbC1tYXJ2ZWwtdW5pdmVyc2UtaHVtYW4tdG9yY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGJpYmxlLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2ppbS1jYXJyZXktcmV2ZWFscy11bmRlcnJhdGVkLWZhdm91cml0ZS1tb3ZpZS1oZXMtZG9uZS0yMDIyMDMyOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jim Carrey Reveals Underrated Favourite Movie He's Done,"The Sonic the Hedgehog 2 star has plenty of classics to his name but one stands out as a favourite

Jim Carrey has plenty of classics to his name but there's one underrated comedy that stands out as a favourite. Find out below:

Comedy underwent a one-man evolution with Carrey's arrival. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective The Mask and Dumb and Dumber on their own would make anyone a star but that back-to-back run brought him unprecedented fame.

Advert

For any child born in the '90s his filmography was essential viewing. For me he'll always be Lloyd Christmas but for today's generation of youngsters he's Dr. Robotnik the moustachioed villain of Sonic.

Carrey has returned in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Despite being stranded on the Mushroom Planet at the end of the first film the blue speedster's foe is back with a 'brand new stache' and an accomplice: a spiky-fisted red echidna known as Knuckles.

Paramount Pictures

To mark the sequel's release LADbible sat down for a chat with Carrey about the film and his career.

Advert

Sonic's success on the big screen is a rare feat given the past fleeting success of video game movies. Carrey's involvement is particularly special though as it'll no doubt be an introduction to his talents for some kids going to the cinema this weekend.

When asked to pick one film to hand off to younger generations to really brace them for the rest of his work he said: ""Boy that’s a hard one - because it’s like Sophie’s Choice man. They’re all my babies.""

Carrey has done some movies specifically tailored for kids whether it's The Grinch Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who or Mr. Popper's Penguins.

Warner Bros.

With the exception of The Grinch those aren't the movies most instantly think of when they hear his name. On this occasion when nature called Ace Ventura came to mind.

Advert

He said: ""I think if you want to go to the heart of the most animated and carefree performance I’ve ever done you’d go to Ace Ventura.

""It doesn’t care what it is and I think that gave people a certain feeling of freedom from reality so I’d probably go there.""

Carrey then spoke about which of his films he considers to be a favourite.

""I have odd favourites that may not be for kids but The Cable Guy is one of my favourite movies"" he said.

Sony Pictures

The Cable Guy was released in 1996 starring Carrey as Ernie 'Chip' Douglas the titular cable guy.

Advert

The film follows the havoc faced by Matthew Broderick's Steven M. Kovacs when he rejects Chip's friendship.

While still a box office success it was met with far more mixed reviews among critics most of whom seemed divided on the film's darker tone. It's now deservedly recognised as a cult classic and one of Carrey's finest works.

""I think Ben Stiller did an amazing job and it’s populated with the greatest comedy actors of our day when they were just coming into their power. I love that character. That character is all of us: we were all raised by the TV"" Carrey said.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 speeds into cinemas on Friday 1 April in the UK and Friday 8 April in the US.

Chase 21 was what he called a ""shower singer"" who wouldn't even start letting people listen to him sing until his senior year of high school.

It wasn't until a friend's secret recording of him singing in the car went viral online that Chase recognized his potential for a career in music.

""I guess I've always kind of sang I was like scared of my own voice. I didn't want to ever push myself to do something because like what happens if it sounds good? I don't know why that scared me … up until 2019 where I just gave it a shot and went with it. It's taken me far so far.""

After high school Chase started playing shows around Pensacola his regular spot being the upstairs room in The District downtown that doubles as a R&B lounge.

""I love doing really intimate shows where it's just me and a keys player"" Chase said. ""Pensacola always shows out and just really has a great time with me. It's so much fun.""

Jordan Chase also appeared on 'The Voice' when he was 19

Chase said he is up against an elite group of performers on the stage that have performed on other talent competition shows such as ""America’s Got Talent"" and ABC's ""The Voice.""

Chase had a brief run of his own on ""The Voice"" in 2019 when he was only 19 years old auditioning with the song ""Makin' Me Look Good Again"" by Drake White. He auditioned within his first year of pursuing music full-time. After receiving praise from the judges and two chair turns Chase chose Blake Shelton as his mentor. Chase's journey came to an end after being eliminated in the battle round the following week.

Now with years of added experience playing shows around Pensacola to make a living and plenty of support of family and friends Chase said he feels now is his time to give a competition another go.

""Once I was in front of the cameras and I was actually saying why I was there it all got really really serious to me. Like OK we're really here it's time to actually do this thing"" Chase said. ""When I came back this season and tried out I felt like there was a lot of pressure because my whole family they were all pushing me to try it and everything. I just wasn't really 100% sure yet. But I knew when I got there and met everybody and I was filming I was like ‘Okay this is what I want to do and I'm ready to do this.' I just had to believe in myself a little more.""

Getting back to his roots

What Chase lacks in celebrity-status he makes up for with his sultry soulful ballads and breath capacity for never-ending line of riffs and runs.

Growing up with his dad as a pastor soul music was something that flowed as naturally to him as breathing.

""My dad was a preacher and I grew up singing worship"" Chase said. ""That's kind of where it all started.""

He also credits the years his family shortly moved away from Pensacola to New Orleans as a time of great musical influence in his life.

When moving back to Pensacola after Hurricane Katrina the lingering sound of the jazz-lined streets were still stuck on him.

For his ""American Idol"" audition he aimed to showcase his soulful tone through his rendition of the song ""Arms of a Woman"" by Amos Lee. Not only did he feel that the song suited him as an artist but he also knew it would help him keep a cool composure while performing it under evaluation.

""For some reason I don't know why but it's always been really soothing and calming to me"" Chase said of his song choice. ""I knew when I walked into that room my nerves were going to be all over the place. So I wanted to pick something that would keep me calm. I guess it was kind of safe but I was confident in it.""

With a positive response from the judges Chase was given the coveted golden ticket and go-ahead to move forward to the next round.

""When I first started singing the judges were just kind of sitting there and I guess just listening but when I opened my mouth and started (really) singing I got to the good part their eyes … they were getting more engaged"" Chase said. ""They told me I have a lot of really good qualities in my voice.""

Regardless of the outcome of the show Chase said the opportunity has allowed him to grow his confidence and collaborate with other professional artists.

Though Chase is not able to say much about the upcoming duet round episode until after its air date he can promise you one thing: you're not going to want to miss it.

Sherri White-Williamson lives about three miles from a pork processing plant in Clinton N.C. On a good day the air smells fresh tainted by a minor whiff of rotten egg and sewage. On a bad day the odor from the plant is so strong she has to keep her windows closed.

The smell wafts into a local elementary school nearby restaurants churches and the county history museum. Those who live and work in the area say they have to keep fans candles and air fresheners running at all hours to make the air tolerable. The problem is even worse for people living down the road in rural Sampson County near large hog farms where they must endure more potent odors and pollution coming from the lagoons filled with waste and the systems that spray waste onto fields as fertilizer.

North Carolina is the second largest producer of pork in the country and Sampson Duplin and Bladen counties house more than 40 percent of the state’s hog farms. According to census data between a quarter to a third of the population in all three of these counties are Black; around a quarter of Duplin and Sampson residents are Latinx. About 42 percent of residents in neighboring Robeson County—the fourth largest hog producing county—are Native American.

At farms using this system hog waste— feces urine blood and pus—drips through slats in the floors and into open pit lagoons where it is mixed with water. The wastewater often sits uncovered emitting noxious odors and gasses including methane or is pumped out and sprayed as fertilizer on crop fields. There are approximately 4000 lagoons in North Carolina and the sludge—unusable waste left after the liquid has been sprayed—has almost filled many of these lagoons to capacity experts say.

These are often in “communities that are low-income and minority” White-Williamson said.

The pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations disproportionately impacts rural Black Latinx and Indigenous communities in North Carolina including the Haliwa Saponi Coharie and Lumbee tribal nations. Studies have shown they’re more likely to live within three miles of large swine operations. A 2021 report also found that in Duplin County 89 premature deaths per year can be attributed to emissions from hog operations.

Instead of replacing the current waste management system with cleaner and safer processes as Smithfield has done in states like Missouri the hog industry and energy utilities have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in a different more profitable waste management system: Biogas. Biological natural gas often called renewable natural gas is the result of a refining process in which anaerobic digesters—sealed oxygen-free tanks designed to break down organic waste—collect methane from hog waste and convert it into natural gas for electricity.

There are some immediate benefits to the process. By covering open pit lagoons the systems reduce direct methane emissions and odors. But residents researchers and farmers say that this rapidly growing industry is mostly a distraction that doesn’t actually address North Carolina’s growing hog waste problem.

White-Williamson has been fighting the hog industry’s waste management practices in Sampson County for decades. A year ago she launched the Environmental Justice Community Action Network a network of residents and organizations that educate and organize around hog farming and other local environmental hazards. She said widespread adoption of biogas systems will further cement the hog industry’s poor waste management practices in low-income communities of color. Others say it could actually increase water pollution in certain areas. Small-scale farmers are concerned that this newest strategy allows an industry where they see little of the profit to make more money without actually alleviating their waste problems.

Still the industry is expanding quickly: Smithfield Foods a massive corporation that is the largest pork producer in the state reports that in the next eight years 90 percent of its hog farms will feed into biogas pipelines. After experimenting with smaller projects Smithfield partnered with Dominion Energy to invest over $500 million in a major biogas project—one that will mean building large facilities and pipelines in rural eastern North Carolina.

How biogas works

“This biogas plan is a lie” said Larry Baldwin Crystal Coast Waterkeeper of the International Waterkeeper Alliance during an October 2021 public comment meeting held by the Department of Environmental Quality’s (DEQ) Environmental Justice and Equity Advisory Board. “This directed biogas plan to me is one of the more disgusting plans the industry has come up with in recent years. This is nothing but a Band-Aid that’s being applied to [the] lagoon-spray field system to perpetuate its use.”

A booming industry

With tens of billions of gallons of manure produced by hogs per year waste is a massive problem. Biogas is becoming an increasingly popular way to address it: Last November President Joe Biden’s administration pointed to biogas operations as a key way to reduce methane emissions in agriculture.

Powerful institutions in North Carolina including Duke University and Duke Energy have been exploring the viability of biogas production since 2010 three years after the state mandated 12.5 percent of energy must come from renewable sources starting in 2021. This same law stated that by 2025 0.2 percent of this renewable energy must come from swine waste-to-energy sources. That’s enough to power a little less than 122000 North Carolina homes each year.

Smithfield’s major project Align Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) would install anaerobic digesters on farms in Virginia Utah and North Carolina connecting them via pipeline systems to processing plants for “cleaning” and conversion of waste gasses into usable methane. From there the gas is moved through existing natural gas infrastructure.

The North Carolina section called the Grady Road project would comprise more than 30 miles of pipelines—the exact location of which Smithfield has not shared—that connect 19 hog farms in Duplin and Sampson Counties to a natural gas processing plant at the intersection of Highway 24 and I-40 between Warsaw and Turkey.

Smithfield says the Align project is expected to capture about 85000 tons of methane each year and will produce enough energy to power 700000 homes over 20 years.

“The Align RNG initiative provides new income potential to North Carolina family farmers by turning one of their biggest costs—hog manure—into a new revenue source” Kraig Westerbeek senior director of Smithfield Renewables and hog production environmental affairs wrote in an email. “In addition to directly benefiting local farmers these projects benefit the surrounding community by creating jobs bolstering local tax bases and driving greater economic development.”

However the Grady Road Project would only create 2.5 permanent jobs and any jobs associated with building the digesters or pipelines are temporary according to NC Policy Watch. Smithfield has stated local farmers will be compensated through long-term contracts. But participating farmers must pay for their own digester systems which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The four farms that currently have permits for the project are corporate farms rather than small family operations; experts and residents believe given the tentative location of the pipelines the rest will be large operations as well. The project was slated to be complete early this year; Smithfield did not respond to requests for comment about an updated timeline.

“This project will not expand hog farming but it will make it more sustainable” Westerbeek said. The company maintains that the project will lead to cleaner air for communities around the farms.

Duke Energy which has multiple biogas projects in the works touts similar benefits. “Historically you’ve had these lagoons that were uncovered that the methane was escaping straight to the environment” said Duke Energy spokesperson Randy Wheeless. “But once you cover those lagoons and are capturing the methane you’re also eliminating that smell as well. And I think environmentally that’s a positive.”

Residents say the industry is hiding behind promises of reduced emissions and bad odors because biogas systems don’t incentivize companies to stop industrial hog farming or find a less intrusive waste management system. Some worry biogas will create more demand for hog farming since it is marketed as a “renewable” energy source.

At a public listening session in October 2021 Duplin County NAACP president Robert O. Moore said that Smithfield promised 20 years ago to install cleaner technology to deal with hog waste. (The company researched other “environmentally superior” technologies but never implemented them.)

“The corporation has refused to implement any technology to clean up the water citing the cost of doing so was too expensive” Moore said. “Yet the cost of this biogas project rivals the costs that would have been to implement cleaner and safer technology to ensure the safety of those living near these operations.”

Still the technology is gaining traction with support from North Carolina’s Democratic governor Roy Cooper. Last year Cooper signed the 2021 North Carolina Farm Act into law; state regulators will create a “one-size-fits-all” general permit for biogas that would fast-track the permitting process for any farm in the state looking to add an anaerobic digester to their lagoons.

“Other than the four permits that have already been issued every other facility connected to this Grady Road Project is going to be authorized under this general permit that’s being developed right now” said Will Hendrick environmental justice policy deputy director for NC Conservation Network at a March community meeting in Sampson County. “So too will the next biogas project in the next community. And the next one after that.”

Another form of environmental injustice

Living near a hog farm operation is linked to higher rates of kidney disease certain cancers asthma and anemia. The misted feces from spray fields contain pathogens antibiotics and nitrates that can lead to antibiotic resistance and weaken the immune system increasing likelihood of death from kidney failure tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases.

Since many rural residents get their water from wells there’s a constant fear of hog waste seeping into groundwater high concentrations of which can lead to ammonia poisoning as well as premature infant mortality or blue baby syndrome.

Jeff Anstead a citizen of the Haliwa Saponi Tribe whose members mostly live in Warren and Halifax Counties said odors from a nearby hog farm are affecting Indigenous cultural practices too. After visiting the Coharie tribe in Sampson County for their annual pow wow Anstead said that “when the sun went down and dew started to fall the hog farm was located directly behind them … [the smell] was almost unbearable.”

Twenty-five years ago because of reports of pollution from hog waste the state put a moratorium on building new concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and expanding existing ones. In 2007 the state passed legislation that permanently banned the construction or expansion of lagoon and sprayfield systems requiring any new or expanding farms to meet five strict environmental standards for waste management. Operations built before the moratorium were not required to do so . And biogas does not address these revised environmental standards.

The problem is likely to get worse. As the climate changes extreme rainfall and storms are becoming more intense and frequent in North Carolina. When a lagoon leaks or breaches during a heavy rainfall event—which happened during Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018—waste can travel into nearby waterways causing ecological damage and fish kills due to excess nutrients in the waste including phosphorus.

Communities trying to hold the agriculture industry accountable for pollution from hog waste lagoons and spray fields have had major victories in recent years. Duplin County residents won their 2018 lawsuit against Smithfield for offensive odors pollution and noise that made living nearby unbearable. But the Farm Act of 2018 made it nearly impossible for residents near hog operations to sue the swine industry in the future.

Residents say developers aren’t being transparent about the Grady Road biogas project the permitting process and the locations of participating farms. A year ago North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) approved water quality permit modifications that allows four of the 19 farms on the Grady Road Project to set up their anaerobic digestion systems. In September The Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) on behalf of the Duplin County NAACP and the NC Poor People’s Campaign filed a complaint with the EPA claiming DEQ violated the Civil Rights Act by ignoring the disproportionate impacts of hog farms and biogas facilities on communities of color.

Early this year a judge ruled in Smithfield’s favor upholding the permits after EJCAN Cape Fear River Watch and SELC challenged the four existing permits. However the EPA agreed to investigate whether state regulators discriminated against communities of color when they approved those permits.

Researchers and organizers are concerned biogas operations could cause even more pollution. While covering lagoons is better than leaving them uncovered in terms of methane emissions doing so can cause the amount of toxic ammonia in lagoon wastewater to increase according to co-director of the Duke Environmental Law and Policy Clinic Ryke Longest. In an open waste lagoon ammonia escapes into the atmosphere. With a covered lagoon ammonia is trapped and the amount in liquid waste increases by up to 3.5 times.

“I haven’t seen them show any studies or any evidence to prove that what they say is true about the reduction of pollution that they assert is going on here” Longest said.

The biogas processing plant may also shift some of the air pollution and emissions to other nearby communities. In documents submitted to state air quality regulators in 2020 Smithfield predicted the Grady Road central gas processing plant will produce more than 60 tons of carbon emissions per year.

“It’s very disturbing because biogas is not a clean renewable energy by any means” said Donna Chavis senior climate campaigner with Friends of the Earth and citizen of the Lumbee Tribe.

Big ag takes the profits

Tom Butler and his brother started their hog farm in Lillington N.C. in 1995 after inheriting 200 acres of land from their parents. Five years later they found out the odor from their two open pit waste lagoons and the feces-filled mists they used to fertilize their fields were disrupting neighbors’ lives.

Going forward they wanted to ensure Butler Farms did as little environmental harm as possible. “We made a vow between ourselves that we would try to do something to have an impact [on the industry]” Butler said.

The brothers started by inviting family neighbors and EPA representatives to an open meeting—both to apologize and to assure them that a solution to the waste and odor problems was on its way. Ten years and hundreds of thousands of dollars later Butler Farms installed an anaerobic digestion system in hopes of reducing its methane emissions runoff and odor. The system generates energy that he sells back to local energy providers.

Since the advent of CAFOs and their impact on pricing because of their ability to quickly produce pork in bulk hog farming is no longer a profitable profession for small farmers like Butler. Often they make just enough to keep their operation functioning and to pay their bank statement every few weeks. Butler said when he first started he was $600000 in debt. He said he has not made a dent in it—most of his money goes back into the farm or to the integrators— companies like Prestage Farms who Butler contracts with—to buy more hogs food and supplies. The little additional money he makes selling biogas energy back to his local electric cooperative goes right back into the farm as well.

“Our [hog farm] contract was written so that we would never make any profit at all. Most growers are like me they’re in debt” said Butler. “And they do not want to say anything to make the integrator mad because the integrator could cut their contract.”

Integrators own almost every part of the system except for the waste which farmers must deal with. After over 25 years of raising hogs Butler Farms has accumulated about 12 million gallons of sludge; they produce about 10000 gallons of waste per day. The industry has done nothing to help him address the waste overflow and he says that biogas attempts to put a Band-Aid on what will be a massive sludge containment issue in the state.

“We do not know what their motives are” Butler said. “They don’t share any information with us. They don’t share any goals. But we know that they’re going to do whatever costs the least.”

Nine years after setting up his own waste-to-energy system Butler—who is now 80 years old and runs the operation with his son—is concerned with Smithfield’s recent biogas investment saying it greenwashes the issue of hog waste management in the state by falsely claiming to be environmentally safer.

“It’s just a way for [the industry] to kind of pan the gold out of your water and then they leave you with the waste” Butler said. “I love what I do. I love my industry. But I don’t think we’re doing enough for the environmental part. And they know that but they will not admit it. They don’t care anything about their growers. They care about profit.”

Together with her collaborators and students she has published more than 40 peer-reviewed articles. Her research program has been supported by numerous grants from foundations and agencies such as Duke Energy Foundation the California Energy Commission the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of Interior. In 2020-2021 Townsend-Small was awarded a National Academy of Sciences Jefferson Science Fellowship.

Methane is a greenhouse gas that is up to 86 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Over the past decade concentrations have been rising in the atmosphere at increasing rates. However methane has a complex mixture of natural and anthropogenic sources and scientists disagree on why concentrations have begun to rise in recent years. In this seminar Townsend-Small will discuss her group's research on methane emissions from oil and natural gas sources including measurements from right here in Ohio. Assessing the largest methane sources is key to controlling the emissions of this dangerous climate forcer.

The methods used were barbaric. The civilian death toll huge.

This despicable show of violence did not however prevent our own Prime Minister Tony Blair flying to St Petersburg to spend a night at the opera house with Putin.

I remember the occasion well: the whole centre of the city was closed down for the motorcade.

But I remember it too as a shocking illustration of how the leaders of the democratic West will turn a blind eye as and when it suits them.

Few could doubt what sort of man Blair was travelling to meet. But he went there all the same.

According to campaign group Transparency International Russian oligarchs have invested £1.5 billion in London land and property. If you take a look around Eaton Square perhaps the swankiest address in all of Belgravia you soon appreciate what we are up against

He is not the only one of course.

By 2010 Putin had been running Russia for a decade. Aside from destroying Chechnya and bringing it back under Kremlin control he had invaded Georgia a sovereign nation.

He had also commissioned his goons to murder Alexander Litvinenko in London. Poisoned with radioactive Polonium-210 the spy-turned-dissident died one of the most terrible deaths imaginable.

If that brazen attack on our sovereignty was intended as a warning to the world it did not stop Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron flying to Moscow to drum up business for the City of London afterwards.

The fact is that we have shown a staggering degree of complacency towards Putin and the threat he poses. And the complacency has been driven from the very top.

Why were George Osborne then Shadow Chancellor and former Labour trade secretary Peter Mandelson aboard a yacht owned by aluminium king Oleg Deripaska in 2008?

As well-informed people they would have known that the Russian ‘aluminium wars’ of the 1990s were a byword for brutality. And that Deripaska had emerged the winner.

At the heart of the complacency of course is money. As Boris Johnson himself put it while London Mayor: ‘London is to billionaires what the jungles of Sumatra are to the orangutan. It is their natural habitat’.

And so it was – and still is.

It’s not that ministers are unaware of the problem we face. Back in 2018 Priti Patel herself – who is now Home Secretary – asked me how much Russian money was in London when I was giving evidence to a parliamentary committee.

It’s more that they don’t understand the nature of the problem how long it has been going on and how deeply embedded oligarchs’ money has become. And why it is that extracting their ill-gotten wealth is now like trying to remove the egg from a cake.

According to campaign group Transparency International Russian oligarchs have invested £1.5 billion in London land and property. They have educated their children in our private schools and settled their legal disputes in our courts.

We know that between 2008 and 2015 we sold 706 ‘golden visas’ to Russian oligarchs without conducting any checks at all on the origin of their wealth. And we know that wealthy Russians such Roman Abramovich or Alisher Usmanov have spent huge sums on English football teams.

Yet this is just a small percentage of the Russian money that has flowed here often under the cover of shell companies registered in tax havens.

If you take a look around Eaton Square perhaps the swankiest address in all of Belgravia – which makes it one of the poshest places on earth – you soon appreciate what we are up against.

The fact is that we have shown a staggering degree of complacency towards Putin and the threat he poses. And the complacency has been driven from the very top writes Oliver Bullough. Pictured: Tony Blair meets Vladimir Putin for a bilateral meeting at a G8 summit

In the first eight houses you find properties registered in the British Virgin Islands Panama the Isle of Man and Guernsey. The different flats in house number 12a are owned like the layers in a curious cake by shell companies from Delaware Liberia and the BVI.

Are these particular properties owned by Russian oligarchs? Perhaps not but it’s impossible to say for sure because those jurisdictions don’t reveal who owns the companies registered there.

Which is to say that we have no idea how much of our capital city is owned by Putin’s friends.

The Bill that the Home Secretary rushed through the House Commons last month is supposed to solve this problem by demanding that the owners of shell companies declare their real identity. Unfortunately it won’t. Its restrictions are too easy to avoid.

Elementary tricks that wealthy people use to avoid taxes such as owning properties via nominees rather than in their own names will defang the new legislation. In fact oligarchs can simply lie on the paperwork. No one checks if information filed at Companies House is accurate.

The same problem has long hamstrung attempts to identify how much illegal money is laundered into Britain. We know that vast quantities of wealth have left Russia and it is estimated that fully half of all Russian-owned wealth is now outside the country.

And we know how it has got here thanks to colossal money laundering schemes operated by bank branches in Eastern Europe.

Danske Bank’s Estonian branch alone moved 200 billion euros in the years leading up to 2014. In the same year a scandal in Moldova cost the ex-Soviet country a total equivalent to fully 15 percent of its economy.

Who owned that money? Who moved that money? Who indeed stole that money?

We have no idea because the identity of the bank account owners’ was hidden behind shell companies registered in the UK often in Edinburgh.

Although these companies were technically British they were actually owned by offshore companies in tax havens like Nevis in the Caribbean or the Seychelles.

Scottish members of parliament embarrassed by the damage to Scotland’s reputation campaigned hard for parliament to close this loophole but the Westminster government refused to do so instead choosing to deregulate further to save a few thousand pounds from the incorporation costs of private investment funds.

‘It sends a message that we are interested in this area that the UK is open for business’ said a Treasury official. It also sent a message that the UK was very much not interested in helping other countries discover who was behind the most prolific money laundering schemes in history.

This is uncomfortable. It’s as if Britain has been running two foreign policies. While in public we have been standing up for the rule of law supporting democracy and loudly trumpeting our determination to defend our NATO allies against the Kremlin’s aggression in private we have been accepting the Kremlin’s money hiding its crimes and undermining the laws of our friends.

You might be wondering how this happened: when did Britain sell itself so totally to oligarchs?

It was longer ago than you’d think. Back in the 1950s when the British empire was falling apart the City of London was filled with bombsites a shadow of its former self.

The decline of sterling as a world currency meant trade was bypassing London and heading for New York.

But City bankers were still capable of spotting a chance to make money.

It came in the shape of the Soviet Union which was nervous about keeping its dollars in a bank in New York. It was 1955 the height of the Cold War. Joseph Stalin had only been dead for two years tensions were fierce and his successors worried that the Americans might freeze their foreign reserves.

So they kept the dollars in London and lent them to the Midland Bank which discovered that they were quite a profitable asset to have. Other banks joined in first borrowing dollars to fund UK activities then worldwide.

This was the moment when the City was reborn as a centre for offshore finance and the seed of its current prosperity.

The City of London had teamed up with the Soviet Union our fiercest enemy to undermine the capabilities of the United States our closest friend. That is what I call being a butler and it’s what we have done ever since.

Britain solves problems for anyone able to afford our services. We have sold shell companies from our Caribbean tax havens to cartels and mobsters we have provided banking services to corrupt foreign officials we have given oligarchs from all over the world a comfortable home from home. And our lawyers have used our legal system to threaten journalists who seek to write about it.

Putin’s cronies have been allowed to loot Russia to let its infrastructure crumble to transform its courts into weapons rather than impartial arbiters and to run essentially a criminal operation from the Kremlin. And they have felt little or no downside.

Their own children are safe in English private schools their property is safe in London their yachts fly the ensigns of our tax havens and their reputations are protected by the shield of UK libel laws.

So what does Britain need to do? We should start by recognising that we are at war with kleptocratic dictators who dislike democracy loathe open societies and hate the rule of law

Lawyers accountants and other professionals who facilitate the oligarchs’ crimes must be prosecuted. We must stop supplying shell companies that help oligarchs hide their assets.

And we need to equip the people who are fighting on our behalf.

If this were a war we would be discovering that our weapons systems are incoherent and out-of-date that our soldiers are out-numbered under-paid and demoralised.

Most of all we need a thorough change in mind set from our political class about what we are selling when we give oligarchs access to our country.

It’s time to ask what this country is for. Are we a sovereign nation standing up for what’s right?

We present ourselves as supporters of democracy yet we have been in bed with one of the most anti-democratic regimes in the world.

And for far too long we have complacently ignored the dangers caused by our own greedy negligence.

The time has come to decide: are we with the Ukrainians dying beneath Russian bombs – or on the side of the bombers murdering Ukrainians?

You're out of luck if you buy a Samsung flagship for its full price now and hope to resell on a minimal loss. My personal and unscientific findings which include tons of browsing on eBay show that you're likely to lose up to $/£/€300 even if the phone is just 1-2 months old.Apart from the factors mentioned above what doesn't help either is the fact that you aren't going to be the only person selling this phone on this platform.

Apple Google and others aren't an exception but…

Of course other Android brands and even Apple aren't immune to lower resale value or good deals - depending on how you look at it. But that's where timing comes to play.

Here's a quick comparison which I discovered accidentally but perfectly illustrates my point...









Despite being released almost half a year earlier than the Galaxy S22 Ultra  Apple's iPhone 13 Pro Max costs €180/$200 or 16% more than Samsung's top flagship at least judging by this eBay offer from the same seller.





What's more interesting is that when this screenshot was taken the Galaxy S22 Ultra was just a month and a half old. Also a brand new S22 Ultra costs €150/$100 more than a brand new iPhone 13 Pro Max for the same storage variant.









Shopping for phone deals on eBay: How it works

You do you.



The warranty also isn't an issue since Apple and Samsung warranty is universal. Unfortunately it seems like Google's isn't. At least in Europe if you buy a Pixel from a carrier you don't get a separate Google warranty or the ability to send your phone to Google for a repair. But that's not a problem - you still have the retailer's two-year promise.

But that being said eBay deals often give you the chance to snatch an iPhone 13 mini for up to 250 bucks less without waiting around for a retailer discounts deals trade-ins etc. Keep that in mind when buying your next iPhone especially if the model you want is already a few months old. Apple warranty is universal so you get it with the device.Flagship phones from eBay can be in used like-new or in new condition. Oftentimes even the ""used"" ones show no signs of use or sometimes you might need to be willing to live with a few scratches here and there.The warranty also isn't an issue since Apple and Samsung warranty is universal.

A real-life example of a guy paying $700 for an empty box on eBay (resolved)





eBay also happens to be quite safe and reliable. The company offers something called ""eBay Money Back Guarantee"" (look for the label) which promises to resolve any issues that might arise in case the item you bought wasn't in the described condition or if it doesn't arrive at all.





Here's my first-hand experience of getting scammed on eBay...





I don't remember exactly whether it was an iPad or an iPhone but a few months ago I bought and paid about €700/$770 for what I thought was an Apple product. On eBay. With a family member's debit card!





Turns out what I bought was an empty box. I didn't have to wait for the package to arrive to find out what happened. I realized it when I read the description for the fifth time. It was a smooth scam. The description said I was buying just a box but of course in a hurry to get the amazing deal I didn't notice...





A few minutes after buying the most expensive box ever I called eBay. I felt like an idiot as one should. The eBay rep advised me to message the seller and ask him to resolve the ""issue"" before they got involved.





Now I don't know if they ordered a mafia visit at his house or not but it worked! Realizing I realized what I should've realized before paying for an empty box  he sent the money back immediately.





How eBay deals make the best flagship and mid-range phones look overpriced







Now let's get to the main course... Starting off with mid-range phones.





Despite bringing incredible value devices like the new Galaxy A53 and iPhone SE (2022) quickly start to look less appealing if we take into account the resale phone market. Let me give you some real examples that you can actually take advantage of.









Compared to the Galaxy A53 5G the Galaxy S21 FE gives you:



A sleeker lighter and more modern design with thinner bezels

A flagship-grade camera system with 3x optical zoom

A much faster flagship processor (stays faster for longer)

Wireless and reverse wireless charging

Better dust & water protection (IP68)

And if that isn't shocking enough let me get to Apple's iPhone SE (2022) which costs €580 in most of Europe for the (usable) 128GB version. I hear you like small and powerful iPhones which don't cost an arm and a leg?



What if I told you a virtually new iPhone 13 mini with an Apple warranty would set you back just... €20 more on eBay Germany? That's right... €600 for an iPhone 13 mini with the same 128GB storage. I can but I won't even start comparing the iPhone SE and iPhone 13 mini because it's seriously unfair. Right now in Europe €450 gets you the just-released Galaxy A53 5G  which is an excellent device for the price. But as you'll see in the table below €450 can also get you a brand new Galaxy S21 FE from eBay. The story in the US and UK isn't too different either.Compared to the Galaxy A53 5G the Galaxy S21 FE gives you:And if that isn't shocking enough let me get to Apple's iPhone SE (2022) which costs €580 in most of Europe for the (usable) 128GB version.

Probably yes at one point yet after becoming aware of the issues that come with these rides not to mention that they’re not the best to drive most of us have erased that thought from our minds. Not entirely however because there’s always the possibility of having a long-lost rich uncle out there right?

Old timers with power steering air conditioning heated seats modern audio and a relatively new engine under the hood that features no carburetors are the ones to go for as far as this writer is concerned anyway. Sure they cost a lot of money  but if you can afford one then you should go for it because you’d still get those timeless looks wrapped in a more appealing package.If you truly know your way around cars are not afraid of elbow grease have a decent garage with many tools a lot of free time and the funds to back it up then you could turn a classic model into a restomod . Buying the perfect project car is almost half the work and if it comes with a few original parts in decent condition that’s even better.The one pictured in the gallery above however ticks neither box as it is essentially a pile of rust and at the time of writing it was the cheapest used car for sale on eBay . That’s right we resumed the series started last fall with the fourth take on the topic which puts the spotlight on this Cadillac Fleetwood or what used to be one anyway.Made in 1941 it is a $1000 affair and it is worth noting that the vendor accepts four equal monthly payments for it too. But we would be in no rush to make it ours as it does look like a headache and many sleepless nights.For one someone truly interested in it should know how to deal with rust . Secondly they would also have to source some panels such as the hood which appears to be missing completely and trunk lid as it doesn’t look rescuable. The front and rear windscreens a couple of side windows at least one headlight and two taillights are required as well. Add pretty much all mechanical components and a thorough inspection of the original V8 engine and gearbox a complete interior manhours and do the math.A nice Cadillac Fleetwood from 1941 usually sells for around $30000. We found some head-turning ones for $40000 listed for grabs so it’s not that valuable. On top of that it’s not exactly the automotive equivalent of a unicorn either and we wonder if it is actually worth saving.We’re inclined to say ‘no’ though if you’re not so sure about that then we’d advise you to take a trip to Gray Court South Carolina and take a better look at it preferably accompanied by someone skilled enough to advise you on certain aspects.Now if you came here hoping perhaps to land a vehicle for cheap to get you to and fro then you should know that $1000 won’t cut it and you will have to at least double that sum. For around $2500 you could get a 17-year old Dodge Grand Caravan that still looks like it has some life left in it or an Audi A4 with a 3.0-liter engine which will turn 20 next year. These definitely beat walking and they were some of the most affordable drivable cars at the time of writing. Nonetheless we wouldn’t bet our bottom dollar on the 'drivable’ part just by looking at some pictures and taking the vendor’s word for granted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9yYXJlLWNoYXJsZW1hZ25lLWNvaW4tZm91bmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,French farmer finds rare coin featuring Charlemagne just before his death,"A rare 1200-year-old silver coin featuring Charlemagne — one of the only known portraits made of the emperor during his lifetime — was recently rediscovered and promptly taken on a wild journey from a farm in France to the bidding grounds of eBay and finally to a museum in Germany.

The coin's modern travels began when a man in France wanted to build a house but was short on cash. He remembered that he had inherited a coin collection from his grandfather a farmer in the Paris region. After going through his grandfather's collection the man discovered the Charlemagne coin known as a denarius and he put it up for auction on eBay.

""We have here some experts that regularly check what is on eBay concerning archaeology"" said Frank Pohle director of the Route Charlemagne a group of municipal museums in Aachen Germany that focus on cultural history. ""One of them told me 'Hey there is a piece of money in eBay France that could be a real denarius of Charlemagne.""

The museum decided to enter a bid. To their relief they got the coin depicting Charlemagne and his imperial title: IMP(erator) AVG(ustus) a reference to Emperor Augustus the first Roman emperor and a title used by the many emperors of the Roman Empire  whom Charlemagne was trying to emulate. (Pohle wouldn't reveal the coin's price but said ""It was not that expensive. We are very content."")

Charlemagne (ruled A.D. 768 to 814) also known as Charles the Great was king of the Franks and became the first ruler to unite Western and Central Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century A.D. Due to his political power military might and close relationship with the Vatican Charlemagne was crowned emperor of the Romans on Christmas day in A.D. 800 .

So perhaps it's no surprise that in this coin portrait Charlemagne ""presents himself really as Roman emperor"" Pohle told Live Science. ""He has the laurel on his hat which is quite unusual for Frankish kings. He is wearing a dress like a Roman general.""

The portrait also reveals that Charlemagne had a round face a mustache and a short neck the latter a detail noted by Charlemagne's biographer Einhard Pohle said.

Putting his portrait on the 0.7-inch-diameter (1.9 centimeters) coin ""has something to do with his ambitions"" Pohle told Live Science. ""That type of coin is quite a good copy of what the Roman emperors did in their times … to use money as a piece of their own marketing purposes.""

There are only about 50 individual denarii coins bearing a portrait of Charlemagne created in his lifetime. ""Most [denarii] only have his name on it no portrait"" Marjanko Pilekić a numismatist and research assistant at the Coin Cabinet of the Schloss Friedenstein Gotha Foundation in Germany who is not involved with the newfound coin told Live Science.

The back of the coin features a building which has a Christian cross on it and looks like a mix between a Roman temple and a church Pohle said.

When was it minted?

Museum experts have determined that the 0.5-ounce (1.5 grams) coin was likely minted in Aachen due to the city's importance as that's where Charlemagne was possibly born and later died. But the date of its minting is unclear. After being crowned Roman emperor he didn't immediately use the title ""Emperor Augustus"" found on the coin.

""Although he was already crowned in 800 he didn't use that title [until] 812"" Pohle said. ""It had something to do with his diplomatic connections with Byzantium"" also known as the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire. Instead Charlemagne used the title ""Emperor Governing the Roman Empire"" according to Britannica .

Finally in 812 the Byzantine Empire recognized Charlemagne's emperorship so he started using the title found on the coin making this a possible date for the coin's minting Pilekić said. The coin also could have been minted in the year 813 when Charlemagne's son Louis the Pious was appointed as co-emperor and had similar coinage made.

""Charlemagne was ill during the last three to four years of his life i.e. around 810-814 and was particularly concerned about the future of the empire"" Pilekić said. ""He had only one son left whom he appointed co-emperor in 813. One theory is that the portrait coinage were created in the last year of his life. That is at a time when he was probably striving for an orderly succession.""

Another idea is that ""these coins were specifically intended to commemorate the occasion of the emperor's coronation and therefore did not really serve as money like the other denarii of Charlemagne which do exist in significantly larger numbers without a portrait and imperial title"" Pilekić added.

It's hard to say how much this coin was worth at the time. ""The amount of silver is quite low"" but if you had 12 to 20 denarii you could probably buy a cow Pohle said.

SUNNY SIDE UP Rare error £2 coin that looks like an EGG sells for £105 on eBay – could one pop up in your change?

A RARE £2 coin has sold well above its face value on eBay - and it's all because it has a very peculiar fault.

The design error has meant the coin is left looking like a runny fried egg as the middle has ""spilt"" out onto the outer rim.

2 The design looks like it's spilled over - and resembles a fried egg Credit: ebay

2 Bidders managed to hike the price of the coin to over £100 Credit: ebay

Because of the strange quirk bidders were willing to stake up to £105 on the coin.

Six budding collectors battled it out to claim the copy for their own.

The final sale was called on March 20.

The collectors placed a total of eight bids between them and the rare coin eventually sold for over 50 times its face value of £2.

Two pound coins like this one have two metal rings - one on the outside made of a yellow nickel-brass ring and the one inside is made of a steel coloured nickel plated brass.

But this error coin has been mis-struck somewhere in the minting process meaning the middle ring is not perfectly lined in the centre.

The Royal Mint manufactures between three million and four million coins a day so often things will go wrong.

This coin has double the story to tell though.

Not only does it sport the odd error but it already has a commemorative design on the reverse.

It's known to collectors as the Charles Dickens £2 and was issued in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the author's birth.

The design aimed to celebrate the life and work of Charles Dickens spelling out the titles of some of his most famous novels and characters including Little Dorrit Bleak House and a Tale of Two Cities.

And those words are written in the shape of Dickens' profile on the coin.

Around 8.1 million were minted which doesn't make it a particularly rare coin from the get go - but the unusual error will have piqued the interest of collectors looking for a more original copy to get their hands on.

It wouldn't be the first time a faulty copy of the design has gone under the virtual hammer either.

One with two errors of its own sold for £205 previously while another sold for a whopping £350 because the writing was claimed to be upside down.

Could one pop up in your change?

Error coins are still legal tender so while they may look a little odd there's still a high chance they could turn up in your change.

So long as they're not too misshapen they might make their way through tills or hands parking machines or vending kiosks and slip by unnoticed.

Keep an eye out though and you could be quids-in.

But that being said the error isn't supposed to be there in the first place so the version you find won't have been made in a high volume.

They're not as likely to show up in your change as other rare designs but that can often spur collectors to bid more money if you try to sell on eBay.

The harder they are to find the more profit you might make.

It's the same with limited edition designs that The Royal Mint officially releases with low mintage figures - because less are circulating they are deemed more scarce and valuable by collectors.

But experts warn that a number of fake coins often end up in circulation so you have to be careful when you're bidding online.

Change experts like Coin Hunter or Change Checker will help you verify if your rare finds are real and they can help place a value on coins you have.

You can scroll through other eBay listings to get a general idea of how much collectors are willing to pay too.

And usually you can determine if something is the real deal by the number of bidders who were willing to stake their claim on it.

We've often seen bidding wars break out on the most highly sought-after copies.

But keep in mind that a buyer can always pull out of the sale which means it won't have sold for the price that it may say it has."

Speaking to USA Today’s For The Win Flynn revealed that Dragon Age: Inquisition’s development suffered due to the Frostbite engine which DICE created for its Battlefield series. Additionally the game was bogged down by cross-gen development.

The Witcher 3 vs Dragon Age: Inquisition – why CDPR’s game is better

According to Flynn the “biggest compromise” came from shipping Dragon Age: Inquisition on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 simultaneously with its PS4 and Xbox One versions. “That crushed so much ambition because we didn’t have the team size or the time to differentiate those things truly” he said. “So you had to kind of develop the lowest common denominator and as that came in that certainly beat out some expectations and ambitions we had for certain fun features in gameplay. In contrast CD Projekt didn’t do that with The Witcher 3 a few months later and I think their game was better for it.”

Worth noting that CD Projekt RED didn’t have a publisher like Electronic Arts breathing down its neck. Flynn’s comments indicate that the decision to ship Dragon Age: Inquisition for both hardware generations came from higher up. That said he seems to blame Frostbite equally for the game’s development woes. “Being a programmer I underestimated the difficulty that Frostbite was presenting to our dev teams and I wish I wish I’ve done a better job of communicating that to the top brass at EA” Flynn regretfully told USA Today while taking a portion of the blame. “I wish I’d been understanding of the friction the engine created for us building a very different kind of game.”

Developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts the game hit the 100 million registered play mark in a span of just 3 years. It is set in the same universe as Respawn’s Titanfall with some characters making an appearance in the game.

But in the last few days players have complained of various issues affecting the game such as the chat not working on Xbox and settings resetting after the next gen update.

And as if the aforementioned issues are not troubling enough Apex Legends players are now saying (12345) that they are getting a ‘Server received bad player data from storage’ error message when they try to play the game.

Many say they are unable to join matches and are kicked out of the round after the error pops up. Common troubleshooting solutions such as restarting the system and reinstalling the game are making no difference.

You can see in the image below what the error message looks like for some.

Here are reports from Apex Legends players who are getting the ‘Server received bad player data from storage’ error message.

The game is available for Windows PS4 PS5 Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S platforms in February 2022. GRID Legends offers thrilling motorsport racing where players can create dream race events dive into live races etc. But some GRID Legends players are experiencing no audio issue out of the blue. Where the game audio is muted or sound is cutting out randomly. If you are having the same exact problem or if the game’s sound seems to be crackling this troubleshooting guide should help.

When GRID Legends was released recently it came with a lot of minor issues. While developers are still trying to patch the game some minor issues regarding graphics controls or audio pop up from time to time. One of such issues is the sometimes random loss of audio in the middle of the game. This is strange as the audio goes on mute without any warning or error message.

Fix: GRID Legends No Audio | Sound Cutting Out

This guide is made assuming that the sound issue is from GRID Legends game only. If you are facing sound issues from your PC (i.e all the apps sound not working) then we recommend you follow the basic troubleshooting steps.

Configure default sound device

Reinstall audio drivers

Check audio output devices

Check Windows audio settings

Or you may follow our comprehensive guide on fixing sound issues on Windows PC.

Restart Devices

Since Cyberpunk is prone to errors restarting the game will help to reload all the game files and fix the issue. Sometimes restarting your PC may also help with the process.

Check the basics

some GRID Legends players are experiencing no audio issue out of the blue. Where the game audio is muted or sound is cutting out randomly. If you are having the same exact problem or if the game’s sound seems to be crackling this troubleshooting guide should help.

Sometimes it happens that the headphone we are suing has gone malfunctioning due to overstretching the audio cable. It is also possible that you mistakenly have pressed the mute button and now the game is on mute. Please check the Windows Sound Settings choose the correct output device (if you have more than one) or use the Troubleshoot button to let the system find a solution for you.

Check the Volume Mixer Menu

The sound mixer on your PC shows all the sources and applications from which the sound is currently coming. Sometimes we mistakenly mute the sound coming from the game. With the volume mixer panel you can fix the volume for the particular game or app.

Right-click on the sound icon present at the bottom right of your taskbar and click on the Open Volume Mixer option.

Find GRID Legends check the volume level settings. If it is mute kindly unmute it.

Tweak audio device properties

All speakers come with their own frequency band range and if they are configured to run on low frequency then some of the game sounds may not play. You can easily fix this problem by re-adjusting the frequency. Here’s how:

Open Sound Setting and navigate to Sound Control Panel.

Highlight the Default Device and double-click on it.

Click on the Advanced tab.

Select 24 bit 44100 Hz (Studio Quality).

Save the settings and see if it helps.

If none of the above methods gave out fruitful results to fix the game audio try updating the device’s sound driver. It might be the case of an older sound driver causing all the issues. So to update it follow the below steps:

Click on the Start menu and search for Device Manager.

Then right-click on the Audio Input and output option.



Click Update Driver from the option.

Select Search automatically for the updated driver software. Windows will automatically search for the best drivers for you. Wait for the process to finish. Once it does the random sounds issue from the GRID Legends game should have been fixed.

Conclusion

The most common reason behind audio issues with the game is due to poor sound drivers. We recommend you check or update your audio drivers from time to time. The above troubleshooting methods will help you to fix GRID Legends no audio or sound cutting out issues. But if these do not help we recommend you to re-install the game and see if it helps."

Findings from a new Cleveland Clinic-led phase 1 trial show that an experimental “gene silencing” therapy reduced blood levels of lipoprotein(a) a key driver of heart disease risk by up to 98%.

Findings from the “APOLLO Trial: Magnitude and Duration of Effects of a Short-interfering RNA Targeting Lipoprotein(a): A Placebo-controlled Double-blind Dose-ranging Trial” were presented today during a late-breaking science session at the American College of Cardiology’s 71st Annual Scientific Session and simultaneously published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Steven E. Nissen M.D.

In the trial participants who received higher doses of SLN360 – a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic that “silences” the gene responsible for lipoprotein(a) production – saw their lipoprotein(a) levels drop by as much as 96%-98%. Five months later these participants’ lipoprotein(a) – also known as Lp(a) – levels remained 71%-81% lower than baseline.

The findings suggest this siRNA therapy could be a promising treatment to help prevent premature heart disease in people with high levels of Lp(a) which is estimated to affect 64 million people in the United States and 1.4 billion people worldwide. It is estimated that nearly 20 to 25% of the world’s population has elevated Lp(a).

“These results showed the safety and strong efficacy of this experimental treatment at reducing levels of Lp(a) a common but previously untreatable genetically-determined risk factor that leads to premature heart attack stroke and aortic stenosis” said the study’s lead author Steven E. Nissen M.D. Chief Academic Officer of the Heart Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic. “We hope that further development of this therapy also will be shown to reduce the consequences of Lp(a) in the clinical setting through future studies.”

Lp(a) has similarities to LDL also known as bad cholesterol. Lp(a) is made in the liver where an extra protein called apolipoprotein(a) is attached to an LDL-like particle. Unlike other types of cholesterol particles Lp(a) levels are 80 to 90% genetically determined. The structure of the Lp(a) particle causes the accumulation of plaques in arteries which play a significant role in heart disease. Elevated Lp(a) greatly increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Although effective therapies to reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering LDL cholesterol and other lipids exist currently there are no approved treatments to lower Lp(a). Since Lp(a) levels are determined by a person’s genes lifestyle changes such as diet or exercise have no effect. In the current study the siRNA therapy reduces Lp(a) levels by “silencing” the gene responsible for Lp(a) production and blocking creation of apolipoprotein(a) in the liver.

In the APOLLO trial researchers enrolled 32 people at five medical centers in three countries. All participants had Lp(a) levels above 150 nmol/L with a median level of 224 nmol/L (75 nmol/L or less is considered normal). Eight participants received a placebo and the remaining received one of four doses of SLN360 via a single subcutaneous injection. The doses were 30 mg 100 mg 300 mg and 600 mg. Participants were closely observed for the first 24 hours after their injection and then assessed periodically for five months.

Participants receiving 300 mg and 600 mg of SLN360 had a maximum of 96% and 98% reduction in Lp(a) levels and a reduction of 71% and 81% at five months compared to baseline. Those receiving a placebo saw no change in Lp(a) levels. The highest doses also reduced LDL cholesterol by about 20%-25%. There were no major safety consequences reported and the most common side effect was temporary soreness at the injection site. The study was extended and researchers will continue to follow participants for a total of one year.

The APOLLO trial was funded by Silence Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq: SLN) London UK. Dr. Nissen has served as a consultant for many pharmaceutical companies and has overseen clinical trials for Amgen AstraZeneca Bristol Myers Squibb Eli Lilly Esperion Novartis Novo Nordisk Orexigen Takeda and Pfizer. However he does not accept honoraria consulting fees or other compensation from commercial entities.

Asset manager Fidelity led the Series D investment round.

Moneybox has almost $4B in AUM and 800000 customers.

Financial regulators are putting the squeeze on UK crypto firms.

Digital wealth manager Moneybox has announced a successful Series D funding round from asset manager Fidelity. The 35 million GBP (around $US46 million) will enable the London-based firm to scale its operations and launch new crypto investment products.

Fidelity International Strategic Ventures has previously backed the firm with investments in its 2018 Series B round. Polar Capital also joined the current round for Moneybox which has almost reached $3.9 billion (3 billion GPB) in assets under management according to reports.

Crypto Investment Not Speculation

Moneybox was launched in 2016 to help people invest with their small change. The app has grown substantially offering retirement planning property buying and stock investments and now has more than 800000 users.

Co-founder and co-CEO Ben Stanway is confident that crypto is the next direction for the company. Speaking to Altfi he said that the firm can now deliver on the “societal need for the mass market to have wealth planning savings and services made available to them.” He explained that the app will not offer crypto trading but will focus on portfolio diversification.

“We’re going to be expanding [into crypto] through the lens of diversification not through the lens of speculation”

He added an example of suggesting holding “a couple of percent” in Bitcoin [BTC] as part of a more extensive portfolio reiterating that “We will not be a good place for people to speculate on cryptocurrencies.”

Stanway said that the crypto investment plans were still in the early stages of development adding that there was likely to be “just Bitcoin or maybe Bitcoin and perhaps one or two others” to begin with.

The company’s long-term goal is to offer financial planning services to as many as 15 to 20 million Brits who would benefit from such planning.

UK Regulators Tighten the Leash

The move comes under increasing gloomy skies for crypto regulation in the United Kingdom. The Bank of England and financial regulators have taken a harsh stance toward cryptocurrencies and plan to further restrict and regulate businesses in the sector.

As a result many U.K. firms are already seeking friendlier jurisdictions in Europe such as Switzerland and Croatia. Industry experts have warned of a potential exodus of talent and innovation from the country.

Last week the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) extended the deadline for registering crypto asset businesses for 12 companies but it has since passed for the rest of them.

Reggie Miller doesn't cross the country for everyone he's ever worked with.

But the Indiana Pacers' all-time leading scorer wouldn't miss this sendoff.

Senior media advisor David Benner is retiring after the season and the team honored him before Sunday's game against the Detroit Pistons.

In a surprise Miller showed up at midcourt at the end of the recognition.

Monumental moment for Benner: Jordan returns from retirement against the Pacers

Miller and Benner developed a routine over their course of Miller's career. Before a game Benner would stand courtside and Miller would walk over to him to jokingly chastise Benner pointing a finger close to Benner's face.

Of course they had to recreate that Sunday.

Calling Indianapolis ""a preeminent feature in my life"" the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer explained that after he attended White's funeral in 1990 he changed his lifestyle by finally getting sober and staying that way ever since.

John then dedicated ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"" to White's mother Jeanne White-Ginder who was in the audience.

John had addressed White's role in his addiction fight during a Harvard University appearance in 2017.

“I had the luck to meet Ryan White and his family” John said. “I wanted to help them but they ended up helping me much more. Ryan was the spark that helped me to recover from my addictions and start the AIDS foundation. Within six months (of White’s death) I became sober and clean and have been for 27 years.”

Elton John performed his Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour on Friday April 1 2022 at Gainbridge on Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.

White a Kokomo native who contracted HIV as a child through a contaminated blood transfusion died on April 8 1990. John visited White at Riley Hospital for Children on April 2 just days before he succumbed to his illness.

John made a surprise appearance at the fourth Farm Aid benefit concert at the RCA Dome on April 7 the day before White's death. He performed ""Daniel"" ""I'm Still Standing"" and ""Candle in the Wind"" dedicating the last song to White.

""It was an experience that concertgoers always hope for and rarely get: A moment in which contemporary music's power to grab your heart and rip it out roots and all is felt by practically everyone in the concert hall."" - Indianapolis News critic Mike Redmond on how the songs were received by the audience of 45000.

At White's April 11 funeral at Second Presbyterian Church 7700 N. Meridian St. John led the congregation in singing ""The Lord is My Shepherd."" He also performed his 1969 tune ""Skyline Pigeon"" and served as one of White's pallbearers.

Twenty years later White's mother Jeanne White-Ginder introduced John as her ""guardian angel"" at a benefit event titled “A Celebration of the Life and Legacy of Ryan White"" at Clowes Hall on April 28 2010.

John performed 13 songs at the fundraiser for the Children's Museum of Indianapolis and the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Admission ranged from $150 to $500.

""You don't meet people like Ryan very often in life"" John told the audience. ""So I can only say 'Thank you thank you thank you.' ""

The data centre is being built in cooperation with Omantel the regional leading wholesale carrier of the Middle East and will be commercially and operationally managed in full by Equinix as a carrier-neutral and open access Equinix International Business Exchange (IBX) data centre.

The new site named SN1 demonstrates Equinix’s commitment to Oman and the Middle East region. SN1 will be the second carrier-neutral data centre to be built in Oman after MC1 in Muscat and will be Equinix’s fifth data centre in the region alongside strategic sites in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Once open SN1 will become a key interconnectivity point for traffic flows between Asia Europe and Africa.

“We are delighted to extend our successful partnership with Equinix through establishing this new international subsea cable hub in Salalah which is strategically located in the south of Oman on the coast of the Arabian Sea” Talal Al Mamari Chief Executive Officer of Omantel stated.

“Salalah is the rising star of the Middle East for Asia to Europe and Africa subsea cable systems passing the region and is quickly establishing itself as the new main regional strategic interconnection point. Salalah will be the hub for a connectivity ecosystem much needed to meet an ever-increasing demand for onwards connectivity to the Middle East and Africa” Al Mamari concluded.

By shortening the length and route of many highly strategic and important cables in the region the new SN1 site in Salalah will change the landscape of global traffic flows by creating a much more cost-effective route to connect businesses to the Middle East. The new site will also offer direct fibre links to Equinix’s MC1 in Muscat the first carrier-neutral hub in the Middle East and enables carriers content providers and cloud providers to co-locate critical IT infrastructure in the region.

“We are seizing on this fantastic opportunity to invest in Salalah by building a world-class data centre that will undoubtedly change the landscape of global traffic flows between three major continents” said Kamel Al-Tawil Managing Director of Equinix Middle East and North Africa. “With access to several new and existing submarine cables this major new interconnectivity point continues Equinix’s strategy of developing network-dense and interconnectivity-rich ecosystems” he added.

The SN1 facility is the latest subsea landing site in a string of strategic subsea investments for Equinix. In December 2021 the company announced it had been selected by SUB.CO for the hosting of the 9800-kilometre Oman-Australia Cable (OAC) into its International Business Exchange™ (IBX®) data centres in Perth Australia and Muscat Oman. Additionally in 2021 Equinix opened similar cable hosting sites in Genoa and Bordeaux as well as announced the opening of significant subsea connections with EllaLink in Portugal and Brazil.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL1RlbGVjb21tdW5pY2F0aW9uL05UVC10aWVzLXVwLXdpdGgtQXVzdHJhbGlhbi1mdW5kLU1hY3F1YXJpZS1pbi1kYXRhLWNlbnRlci1pbnZlc3RtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NTT ties up with Australian fund Macquarie in data center investment,"TOKYO -- Nippon Telegraph and Telephone is partnering with Australia's Macquarie Asset Management to jointly own data centers in Europe and the U.S. so that the Japanese telecommunications giant need not shoulder the entire investment alone amid booming global demand.

In 2002 Betty Noujaim and her husband paid $327000 for a three-bedroom townhome in Glendale California a suburb north of Los Angeles.

Eight years later the couple divorced leaving Noujaim with sole ownership of the home. The property's value climbed steadily in the decade after the Great Recession and by late 2019 Noujaim realized she was sitting on a mountain of home equity — money that could go a long way toward paying other bills.

Noujaim soon learned though that turning her equity into cash would be more difficult than she thought.

Homeowners seeking to unlock their equity have often turned to cash-out refinancing which allows a borrower to cash in on home appreciation in exchange for a bigger mortgage at a new rate. But Noujaim who said she is permanently disabled after suffering a work accident in 2001 relies on a fixed income making it difficult for her to qualify for a new mortgage at a good rate.

She considered a home-equity loan — a second mortgage in which homeowners borrow a lump sum and use their home as collateral — but her credit score was too low to get a decent rate. The same applied to a home-equity line of credit or HELOC. And she was still too young to qualify for a reverse mortgage which is available to homeowners 62 years and older. It became clear to her that taking on more debt ""was not going to happen"" Noujaim told Insider.

Then Noujaim received a letter from a company called Point which offered to pay her a lump sum for a slice of her home equity. The deal commonly referred to as a home-equity investment or shared-equity agreement would allow Noujaim to tap into her equity without assuming debt. In exchange Point would receive a stake in the future appreciation of her home's value.

Noujaim wrestled with the decision. But the reality was that without good credit she had few options. The money Point was offering could be a vital lifeline and she was enticed by the lack of monthly payments. In late 2020 she sold Point a 25% stake in her home's future appreciation and received $60000.

Wall Street sees the next big opportunity to bet on housing

Point is part of a relatively young crop of companies looking to capitalize on the historic amount of American wealth that's tied up in home equity with backing from some of the world's largest institutional investors. In August Point announced it had amassed more than $1 billion in capital commitments from the likes of Atalaya Capital Management Kingsbridge Wealth Management Palisades Group and Redwood Trust.

Point and its competitors say they're providing a win-win scenario. Homeowners can cash in on their equity without adding debt or selling their homes and Wall Street firms hungry for stakes in residential real estate can expand their portfolios.

Home values have soared during the COVID-19 pandemic and the US housing stock is worth $38 trillion of which about $26 trillion is homeowners' equity according to the Federal Reserve. That means homeowners' equity is equal to about 69% of all household real estate the highest share since the 1980s.

Rising interest rates might be working in favor of home-equity companies. Options like a refinancing no longer make financial sense to homeowners with low-rate mortgages leaving them to seek alternatives to unlock their equity.

Indeed Point has seen an explosion in business over the past 24 months with funded volumes up more than 400% in the past year said Eoin Matthews Point's cofounder.

Big investors are embracing the idea. In 2018 Point landed its first institutional investor Atalaya Capital which agreed to buy up to $150 million of the contracts. Point now works with about 10 such buyers Matthews said.

""They're all large very sophisticated institutional buyers with very big mandates"" Matthews told Insider. ""It just exemplifies how the product is going mainstream.""

Point's competitors include companies like EquiFi Unison and Hometap. The companies are backed by household names among institutional investors including Bain Capital Citigroup and Prudential Financial.

""There's a lot of smart money that understands both private equity and real estate quite well that's trying to figure out how to partner in this space"" George Kenny a managing director at Tangent Capital Partners who is an advisor to EquiFi said.

'It saved my butt'

Homeowners who make a deal with Point agree to a 30-year term during which they can buy back Point's equity at any time by paying the company the initial amount plus an agreed-upon percentage of the home's appreciation during that period.

Point often gets its returns sooner Matthews said since customers usually pay the company back when they refinance take out a home-equity loan or sell their house. The average lifespan of Point's home-equity investments is five to eight years he said.

""A lot of people do look at their home as their nest egg and so if they're going to touch the funds that are in that nest egg they're going to be pretty shrewd about it"" Matthews said. ""They're going to use it in meaningful ways. Very few people — I would say probably none — do this for lifestyle reasons or just want the cash for the fun of it.""

Such was the case for Noujaim the homeowner in California who first learned of Point in 2019. A roof leak in 2012 had destroyed two of the rooms in the house and the necessary remodeling had wiped out her savings Noujaim said.

Other bills continued to mount and Noujaim who now shares her home with her daughter and son-in-law sought a financial cushion.

The offer from Point ""came at just the right time"" Noujaim said. ""It saved my butt.""

Point originally offered Noujaim $120000 for a stake in her home but she opted to accept half that amount so she could preserve an ""enormous amount"" of equity for the future she said.

Of course there are downsides to a shared-equity agreement. Point for instance applies a risk adjustment of 15% to 20% to the home's initial value meaning that if a home is worth $500000 Point could value it at $420000. For homeowners that might mean giving up more equity or getting less money than they anticipated.

The company said it discounts the home value to offset potential declines and to protect its initial investment. If the home depreciates below the risk-adjusted value Point shares in the downside by reducing the buyback cost to the customer. If the home appreciates past a certain threshold that cost is also capped the company said.

Homeowners with good credit and healthy incomes have a plethora of financing options at their disposal. But for people like Noujaim who are deemed less creditworthy a home-equity investment could offer a valuable alternative.

In late 2020 Noujaim received the money from Point. She said the company regularly updates her on her home's estimated value and the amount she would need to pay to buy back her equity. She might do that in five years if she sells her home to move out of the area or if she secures a reverse mortgage when she qualifies.

As of October Noujaim's home was valued at about $740000 Point told her in a quarterly email. To buy her equity back today she would need to pay the company $60000 plus about $12000 in appreciation she said.

""It's all cut and dried"" Noujaim said. ""There's no ambiguity to it. And that makes me feel very comfortable.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2dhemV0dGV0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9jb3J2YWxsaXMtY291bGQtc2VlLTIwLW1pbGxpb24tYWZmb3JkYWJsZS1ob3VzaW5nLWRldmVsb3BtZW50L2FydGljbGVfZGMzMzg2OGMtZGYzNi01YTU4LWE3NjQtMWE5N2VlOGVmYjUwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corvallis could see $20 million affordable housing development,"A developer wants Corvallis City Council’s support and $400000 to help with a $20 million 60-unit low-income housing project.

City documents say staff is recommending the council approve an award of $400000 in Affordable Housing Construction Excise Tax funding to build the proposed Rivergreen Apartments in Willamette Landing. The money comes from other developers doing business in the city who pay a tax to help future affordable housing projects.

Applicant Green Light Development is also requesting a letter of support from the mayor and City Council for its state application.

The project site which is zoned for both residential and commercial purposes is on the northwest corner of Southeast Rivergreen Avenue and Southeast Midvale Drive. The development would include a mix of one- two- and three-bedroom apartments for people at or below 60% of the area median income according to city documents.

“Qualifying individuals typically make less than $17 per hour and work jobs in the local community which include restaurants grocery stores and various entry-level and service industry jobs” a funding application states. “Our development seeks to blend into the surrounding neighborhood and become part of the larger community of Corvallis.”

The Corvallis City Council is slated to decide on the $400000 funding award and the letter of support at its meeting Monday April 4.

The developer plans on working with community partners to feature resident services that may include health and wellness budgeting credit and finance energy assistance legal protection mediation eviction prevention and employment and career advancement according to the funding application.

The application also mentions a shortage of affordable housing options in Oregon particularly for historically underserved and low-income communities. The applicant cites an Oregon Housing and Community Services report that Corvallis is the state’s most rent-burdened community.

“New developments like the Rivergreen Apartments are essential to providing individuals and families with affordable housing options at a time when a lack of safe and stable housing options has led to an increase in homeless individuals and families as well as severe rent burdens” the applicant wrote.

The applicant also cites an Oregon Housing Alliance report stating Benton County faces a deficit of more than 4500 affordable units available to individuals and families. The organization reports that close to 40% of renters are paying more than 50% of their income in Benton County.

“The Rivergreen Apartments directly respond to the critical need for affordable housing in Corvallis and Benton County” the applicant states.

In April Green Light Development plans to apply for state resources including Local Innovation Fast Track funds 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credits and construction and permanent debt according to city documents which say the local funding would demonstrate support which would be helpful in leveraging state and federal resources.

The developer plans to reach slightly more than $20 million for the project by combining the $400000 from Corvallis with $6.4 million in Local Innovation Fast Track loan funds $6.8 million in permanent loan financing and $6.06 million in 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credits equity as well as $512162 from a deferred development fee.

The council passed the Affordable Housing Construction Excise Tax ordinance on new residential commercial and industrial development in 2016. The ordinance requires that the revenue be applied to projects and programs that expand the supply of affordable housing in Corvallis. The funding is available on a rolling basis.

The Affordable Housing Construction Excise Tax budget for fiscal year 2021-2022 is $1.3 million. City documents say the only other major expenditure for the budget year was $520000 for a homeownership project in December.

The Affordable Housing Construction Excise Tax policy requires 60 years of affordability and if awarded the funding terms would be a zero-interest loan.

Oregon Senate Bill 8 passed in 2021 makes it easier to site affordable housing. Under the legislation local government is prohibited from requiring a zone change or conditional use permit for affordable housing on property zoned for commercial uses.",,,,,,,,,

No you’re not seeing things. It’s the year 2022 and rotary phones are back. There’s likely a sizeable portion of our audience reading this piece who have only ever seen rotary phones in television shows and never in person. The dial-based phones wherein you rotate the dial around to call someone are back in style.

Today's Top Deals

So why are rotary phones making a comeback? In these stressful times people of all ages are obsessed with nostalgia and all things retro. For Gen Z these phones are a hilarious novelty and for older folks they remind us of simpler times.

For as great as smartphones are sometimes you don’t want to be overloaded with information 24/7/365. Plenty of people including celebrities like Chris Pine have waxed poetic about not having a smartphone and how a more analog approach allows for more free time to do things like reading or even being more engaged with your partner. A rotary phone fills that space but does it in a way that evokes a certain timelessness. It’s similar to how there’s been a recent progression back towards vinyl and record players.

What Do You Need to Know Before Buying a Rotary Phone?

The biggest question you’ll have to answer is whether or not you’ve got a phone line in your home. Most older builds should have an existing line but you may or may not have to get it reactivated. Newer builds probably don’t have one at all so you’ll have to hire someone to run a line. Costs are variable and will depend on your local phone company so be sure to reach out to them to figure out the details. You’ll also need to pay for a dedicated phone plan for it so take that into consideration as well.

If you’re considering a rotary phone in 2022 make it one of the phones we’ve listed below.

1. Sangyn 1960s Rotary Phone

BEST OVERALL

Plus the mechanical style ringer is clear yet loud to ensure you won’t miss a single call when it comes in. And weighing slightly over two pounds it’s easy to pick up and move around if you’re someone that likes to pace when you talk.

Part of the appeal of a rotary phone is in the inherent nostalgia of it all which is why we’re really drawn to the Wild & Wolf 746 rotary phone’s overall design.

The striking red numbers also provide a nice flourish of color to the sleek black appearance helping to create an overall compelling statement piece for any space.

FUNKY HYBRID

Sort of a hybrid between a 1920s-style phone and a 1960s style phone this “FunkyFon” has that t-shaped design with a colorway that feels as if it was plucked from the 60s. But it’s not just this striking orange as the rotary phone also comes in a variety of different colors to best suit your individual personality.

BOUGIEST

Despite its old-looking appearance the phone includes modern functionality like redial but is otherwise pretty straightforward in terms of its use. What it lacks in features (in so far as rotary phones have them) it certainly makes up for in its inspired design.

10. Opis 1921 The Classic Candlestick Rotary Telephone

BEST OLD SCHOOL

Want to throw it back even further? While Opis states this rotary phone is more of an early 1920s-style rotary phone we think it dates back even further since it’s more of a candlestick style phone you might see in your favorite period drama. Either way you have to admire the commitment to a retro design as the entire body of the phone is made from wood. You’ll have to hold one end of the receiver to your ear while you hold up the other portion but you’re into going to really retro this is the rotary phone for you.

Fast forward three years and Appiah now runs a small business right from her kitchen – Mariana’s Life of Pie.

When asked about her journey she says that it all began with a few odd posts on her personal Instagram account. Eventually when the word started getting out she created a separate account just for her business.

Marika Mammen Appiah

“The biggest benefit of Instagram is that it is a very inexpensive online space. Anyone can market and sell their products on it. Whereas with a website you need to invest a little bit” she says.

Akanksha Nene carved a niche for herself in a similar fashion. When she started selling her handcrafted crystal jewellery in 2019 she didn’t have an inkling that she would one day quit her corporate job to pursue her passion full-time.

“In those days the small business scene in India was nowhere close to what it is right now. Social media has really provided an impetus for many people to come out and monetise a skill” observes Nene who currently sells all her products through Instagram under the brand name Gaea.

Finding their true calling

Welcome to the passion economy – an economy built around creators who are motivated to start a brand business or community revolving around their own interests hobbies or passions. The passion economy is fuelled by a plethora of platforms like YouTube Instagram Etsy and OnlyFans. While content creators have become digital stars purpose-driven solopreneurs are scaling businesses born out of their passion on these platforms as well.

According to a Meta spokesperson 90 per cent of people on Instagram follow a business. “The platform brings communities together offering further ways to shop online instead of in-store and providing a place to educate and entertain customers with interactive video experiences.”

The Meta-owned platform indeed struck gold in 2020 when it switched focus to the video format and launched its Instagram Reels feature promptly replacing Tik Tok – which was banned by the Indian government in the same year.

“The world is moving towards video rather than images. People are into short-form musical content that’s catchy and fun. It’s probably why many small business owners use Instagram Reels to reach more people” adds Appiah.

For creators of homespun brands with a limited budget for customer acquisition Reels works out perfectly as even those not following can stumble upon it through both the Explore and Reels tab.

Nene – who has recently begun dipping her toe into the world of Reels – agrees that it’s an effective tool for boosting organic reach. On scaling up plans she said that her next order of business was to get Gaea’s website up and running. She also intends to start promoting her brand through Facebook hoping that this will help her reach a different audience.

Seller-aligned model

Although Nene has briefly dabbled with e-commerce marketplace Etsy she doesn’t feel like it’s the best bet for her business.

“Etsy is an international platform and you need to have PayPal for it. That’s a different headache altogether” she laments.

On the other hand Payal Jaggi – who started her upcycled apparel brand ‘Kinche’ on Etsy – says that the decision to sell her products on the platform was a no-brainer.

Payal Jaggi

“Etsy is one of the biggest platforms for handmade goods and no one is on par with it when it comes to sustainable wear” she says.

Apart from marketing on Instagram Jaggi uses Etsy ads to spread the word about her brand. In her opinion Etsy invests a lot of money to promote its sellers and give them a strong foothold in the business world. “With lower barriers to entry than a traditional business Etsy sellers are able to experiment with entrepreneurship on their own time and in their own style” says an Etsy spokesperson.

Needless to say Etsy’s seller-aligned business model – the platform makes money only when sellers make money – has changed the game for many solopreneurs who are looking for additional income streams. According to Etsy 92 per cent of its sellers are solopreneurs and 97 per cent operate their creative business from home. The platform’s strongest categories in India have been apparel gems and jewellery fabrics and home decor.

Rising to the occasion

Although Appiah Nene and Jaggi agree that Instagram is their go-to marketing tool they have faced their fair share of challenges in creating content consistently on the platform.

“I’m the only person running my business from marketing to sourcing and production. Doing everything end-to-end by myself is difficult” says Appiah adding that she would definitely consider hiring a dedicated team for marketing.

Jaggi isn’t very enthusiastic about the prospect though. She finds it quite difficult to work with contract photographers as they often struggle to understand her vision. To compensate Jaggi found herself picking up a camera and learning the tricks of the trade herself.

“But it’s important to remember that when you’re a small business owner it’s your job to train and employ people. Don’t try to do everything on your own; no man is an island” she adds.

When the Covid-19 pandemic hit consumers became more familiar with online shopping. This shone a ray of hope on small business owners all over the country. As the initial distrust associated with digital payments began to wear off creative entrepreneurs struck while the iron was hot and became active contributors to the booming creator economy. But how far passion and digital tools can take them remains to be seen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb2d0by5jb20vZXZlbnRzL2RlbW9uLXNsYXllci1jb3NwbGF5LWNhZmUtYnktd2hpbXNpY2FsLXR3aXN0LXRvcm9udG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Demon Slayer - Cosplay Cafe by Whimsical Twist,"After a successful Genshin Impact Maid Café. we heard you wanted more!

Avaana's first fund was focused on driving high impact outcomes through the lens of technology and innovation wherein it invested in sectors such as food supply chain-logistics financial inclusion health and education. It invested in insurance tech company Cover Fox bicycle start-up AlphaVector FarMart a SaS-led B2B food supply platform and in Eggoz which claims to be the country's first UV sanitised egg brand. ""Digitisation was also creating out-sized returns so we decided to do it responsibly"" says Anjali Bansal Founder Avaana Capital.

With climate change being the biggest concern world over Bansal in the second fund has decided to sharpen her focus. ""70% of our current portfolio is sustainability related and has performed extremely well. In the new fund we are going to continue investing in food-agri and consumption mobility and supply chain digitization financial and digital enablers. We will add to this energy transition and resources management in air water etc. This makes our focus sharper on climate and sustainability. These three sectors are responsible for 90% of India's emissions and we have picked sectors where we have expertise. These are also core for India to achieve the Panchamrit goals laid out at COP 26"" Bansal further explains. Avaana has already made two investments through this fund – Viki Foods (a hydroponic vegetable grower which promises to increase the yield of vegetables such as onions brinjal tomatoes and leafy vegetables by 300% using 80% less water) and air-purification start-up Praan which is into filter-less air purification.

Multiple Stakeholders

""Globally a lot of capital is available for late-stage funding and in the Northern US and Europe there are funds coming together for early-stage funding. However there is a white space opportunity in India for tech led early stage investments in climate and sustainability. We at Avaana are seeing some outstanding entrepreneurs moving to do start ups in climate and sustainability and we will partner them through investment and full stack business building support to generate outsized returns"" says Bansal. Avaana Capital however is not the first fund in India to make investment through the climate change and sustainability lens. Though a relatively new concept the likes of Everstone Group and GEF Capital Partners have made considerable headway. Funds such as Lumis Partners are getting ready to launch their climate change fund. Sustainability broadly refers to the ESG (Environment Social Governance) framework and increasingly there is a lot of drive for global asset allocators as well as managers to look for companies which are ESG compliant.

""People are discovering that long-term sustainability of businesses itself depends on whether you are adopting ESG principles. So it is not just about ticking a box but doing things which are good for a business over a long period of time"" explains Sridhar Narayan GEF Capital Partners. GEF has invested in a host of businesses such as 3SC (a supply chain/transportation solutions company that focuses on delivering superior decarbonisation solutions in the logistics sector) ESDS (a managed data centre and cloud hosting solutions provider) and Prince Pipes (a manufacturer and distributor of water pipes and fittings which is working on institutional initiatives such as piped water supply sewage rain-water harvesting etc).

In fact investing in ESG complaint companies is a given today for investors. ""We are not saying we are creating a sustainability fund. We are saying we would be investing only in ESG compliant areas. Therefore in everything that we do sustainability becomes a part"" explains Rohit Bhayana managing partner Lumis Partners. The focus area is actually climate change where investors are setting up dedicated climate change funds. While the Lumis climate change fund is on its way the Everstone Group in 2018 set up a $750 million climate change fund EverSource Capital which is investing largely in energy transition and circular economy.

""India has been one of the signatories of the climate change programme which was initiated at Paris and has been a founding member of the International Solar Alliance. In 2017 the Indian government partnered with the UK government to catalyse investments into the Indian market specifically focused on climate change. That's when we realised there is an opportunity for us wherein we as fund managers can take responsibility raise a fund focused on climate change and actually invest in a way that we can drive positive climate outcomes while generating commercial returns for investors"" says Dhanpal Jhaveri vice-chairman Everstone Group and CEO EverSource Capital.

EverSource is largely investing in start-ups which are into renewable energy generation electric mobility businesses supporting electric mobility like OEMs component manufacturers and also in waste recycling services. One of its first investments was renewable energy company Ayana which has 3.5 gigawatts of solar-based hybrid projects under development. The fund has also invested in Radiance an industrial decarbonisation company helping industry and commercial enterprises to reduce their carbon footprint by selling renewable energy and GreenCell Mobility which is into electric vehicles to provide mass mobility.

EverSource is also partnering with the Kolkata municipality to treat 180 million litres of sewage water released by urban consumers in Kolkata and recycle it back as clean water.

Scale and Profitability

Profitability is one of the key tenets for a business to be successful. And most of these businesses focused on sustainability and climate are in their infancy. So how do they make business sense for investors? Sustainability always makes better business sense says Bhayana of Lumis. ""When you are sustainable you are encircling communities encircling a wider consumer base and thereby you do business more cost-effectively.""

Narayan of GEF Capital Partner says an investment through the climate or environment lens fetches a better valuation multiple from the point of view of an investor. ""If you are a process company and you put in place strong procedures for keeping effluent systems you can be sure that no action is initiated against your business because you are compliant in terms of how you manage your effluent streams how you treat the water etc. You don't run the risk of business disruption. For the business itself it's a risk management tool and the risk you are trying to manage is any disruption in the business"" Sridhar further explains.

Jhaveri says the idea is to rapidly scale up each of the businesses the fund has invested in within 4-6 years. ""We are bringing in capital at scale"" he says. In terms of profitability since these are relatively shorter duration projects (6-12 months) compared to the regular infrastructure projects which have a 3-7 year gestation one can have a better control over the risk factors. ""We have a higher degree of confidence of converting something on paper into reality"" says Jhaveri.

Five years ago the capital allocated to ESG was around $5-6 trillion in 2022 it has multiplied to $30 trillion. The fear of massive global warming that causes serious challenges to life and livelihood is pushing countries companies citizens and capitalists to re-engineer what they are doing. ""There is strong interest in climate and sustainability due to 3Cs - capital consumers and community. Large global institutional capital is moving to the space as are consumer preferences and younger talent"" says Avaana's Bansal.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The 80+ employee company is a reminder that VC backing is not the only way to scale up a company. In fact many of the companies on this latest Sifted list of self-funded companies to watch have become large without a penny of equity investment.

Founders often opt for bootstrapping to keep more control over how the product is developed something we explored in our look at how Swedish CRM company Planhat got to a more than 100 employees without external funding.

Control is a common theme among the eight companies we spoke to. Although some are now looking to take external investment the fact that they've already scaled profitable companies means they can afford to be picky about the investors they do take on board — and stay in control.

Talentful

Talentful is a London-based subscription service that helps fast-growing tech companies with hiring. The company's client list includes names like Alphabet Microsoft Deliveroo Atlassian Monzo Einride Expedia Instacart Miro and Waymo. Revenues grew 266% between 2020 and 2021 according to the companies.

The company founded in 2015 by Christopher Abbass and Phillip Blaydes hired more than 200 people in the last year bringing total headcount to 280.

One of the main reasons for going down the bootstrapping route was maintaining control over the business.

“We designed a business model that could be operationally lean scalable and ultimately return profit quickly. We have been able to maintain rapid growth whilst being fiscally responsible and investing funds back into the business for growth. This means we have total control over decision-making and our brand” Abbass tells Sifted.

“We have always liked the idea of building and bootstrapping a robust and high-quality business with a clear product-market fit that we could later supercharge with investment if needed.”

Having said that Talentful isn’t planning on raising money any time soon.

“Never say never but not in the plan for the next 12 months” says Abbass.

Polixis

Gagik Sargsyan started Polixis as a consultancy in 2012 but in 2018 turned it into a regtech company offering software and data on anti-money laundering compliance international sanctions and politically exposed persons.

It has now grown to be a profitable 80+ employee business with revenues growing 43% in the last year.

Sargsyan opted to self-fund the business because he couldn't get attractive terms from VC investors.

“We decided to skip the seed and Series A concepts and invest our own cash. This decision was reinforced after a few exchanges with a few funds that sent juniors to talk to us. Questions we heard from those juniors suggested those funds either are not going to invest or invest in conditions that would be unacceptable to us since they simply did not understand our field” he tells Sifted.

Independence is rare and beautiful

“We also operate in a sensitive field of compliance data banking secrecy and international finance. Our clients do appreciate our complete independence.”

Now however Polixis might consider external investment.

“Maybe some $10m for a minority stake but only on the condition that investors have an impeccable reputation. That said being a profitable company we can skip the raising and keep on growing by 50% or so with funds maybe 100 or 200%. But this is not a matter of principle for us independence is rare and beautiful.”

TaxiCaller

Swedish startup TaxiCaller founded in 2011 has developed a cloud-based dispatch and booking app for taxis and private vehicle hire companies. They also provide this to delivery companies and other customers in the transport industry.

Passengers can also use the app to make online bookings so taxi companies can use the app as an alternative to joining one of the big ride-hailing platforms.

TaxiCaller has been profitable from the start and although it was slowed down by the Covid-19 pandemic growth has recently returned to a “good two digit percentage numbers” says cofounder Lauri Piitulainen.

TaxiCaller didn’t need to raise funding because Piitulainen had been able to cash out in an exit from a previous startup he had founded. “We wanted to keep control of the company and build the company in a stable way” he adds.

As for raising equity financing in the future Piitulainen is on the fence. “We now have customers in so many cities that we see opportunities which would need more funds” he says. But it is still only a maybe for now.

Oviavo

Oviavo founder Jenny Saft

Berlin-based Oviavo founded in 2019 is a seed-stage startup that offers a family planning and fertility employee benefit service to companies.

Fertility benefits include help with planning a family diagnosing any issues with fertility and then offering intervention treatment (using IVF egg freezing and in some countries egg donation).

Settly

Amsterdam-based startup Settly specialises in relocating international talent for companies. Marieke van Iperen who founded the HR-tech startup in 2019 told Silicon Canals that she made a conscious choice to bootstrap the business so she didn't become too obsessed with simply delivering growth to please investors.

“With Settly we wanted to create a business that had the customer and employee experience at the core of its value proposition instead of growth. For us it meant that we wanted to make decisions that follow these principles.”

Still Settly seems to be delivering growth as well. It has grown close to 10-fold year-on-year since it was founded and it now operates in six countries with a team of 30.

Kpler

Brussels-based Kpler provides commodities data and analytics for companies like Shell Trafigura and Nestle. Founded by François Cazor in 2014 it now has 4500 customers worldwide and more than 200 employees. It has an annual recurring revenue of more than $40m and saw revenues grow 50% last year.

This is likely to accelerate further as the company has made a number of acquisitions recently including last September buying ClipperData gaining access to the New York-based company’s database of global cargoes of crude oil grains petrochemicals and other products. It also just acquired JBC Energy a data & analytics business specialising in energy and commodities.

Fertilily

The Amsterdam-based startup founded in 2017 is a medical devices platform that develops tools to help couples conceive at home. It launched a a medical-grade hormone-free conception conception cup that it says increases the chance of pregnancy by up to 48%.

In the majority of infertility cases today patients go directly from the lighter-touch primary and secondary care to the highly invasive IVF space leaving a whole gap in the fertility support journey.

London-based PropertyCard isn’t strictly speaking bootstrapped as it raised a $1.4m pre-seed round in January but as this is still such as small round and the company has been going since 2017 without external finance it is worth a mention.

PropertyCard is a prop-tech startup that provides homeowners and tenants with smart cards to allow them to manage property payments such as rent and utilities.

The first four years have been focused on building the product and 2022 is set to be the first year of revenue expected to be in the region of £200k. Profitability could come as early as the end of this year the company says.

The PropertyCard team have stayed away from external funding so far because they wanted “to keep control and get maximum upside — and to execute on a clear vision” says Oliver Muller CEO. But now as the company is starting to actually trade they are speaking to VCs about a potential £5m seed round.

It's A Little More Complicated.,"To much fanfare American AAdvantage announced that its elite members would have access to JetBlue extra legroom ‘Even More’ seats if available at check-in.

I inquired whether this benefit was available during online check-in not just for JetBlue operated and marketed flights but whether it would also work when booking an American Airlines codeshare for travel on JetBlue. A spokesperson told me it would “customers will need to use the JetBlue online check in path or go to an agent to request these seats.”

Except right as the announcement was being made American Airlines reservations agents were being told the opposite. When booking an American Airlines codeshare traveling on JetBlue AAdvantage elites cannot select extra legroom seats during online check-in and they cannot even select extra seats at airport kiosks  either.

In fact AAdvantage elites can only request extra legroom seats in-person with an agent at the airport on these tickets. Here’s the meat of the March 23rd memo to American Airlines reservations agents:

This much-touted benefit isn’t quite ready for prime time despite the hoopla surrounding it. Extra legroom seats free at the airport is something but there may be less inventory available when you show up for your flight than there would have been checking in online 24 hours prior to your flight.

Once again booking a codeshare is rarely a good idea unless the price if low enough to make up for the hassle and inferior experience. That’s hardly limited to the American-JetBlue relationship.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9saWZlYW5kc3R5bGUvZ2FsbGVyeS8yMDIyL2Fwci8wMi9ob3ctdG8tZXh0ZW5kLXlvdXItaG9tZS13aXRoLWEtZ2FyZGVuLXJvb20taW4tcGljdHVyZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to extend your home with a 'garden room' – in pictures,With a little work and some clever styling a garden can be an extra room – a distinct furnished space that blurs the boundaries between indoors and out.

Basement conversions can be a practical way of providing homes with additional space. They are often found in UK townhouses where floor space is at a premium such as in Georgian Victorian and Edwardian homes in London that were often built with basements to accommodate house staff.

While their subterranean setting means these spaces run the risk of becoming dark damp and unpleasant smart solutions such as light wells and excavations can help to bring light into the space and turn them into useful extra living areas.

In this lookbook we've taken a closer look at a range of different basement conversions including basements that are now host to swimming pools kitchen diners and even entire apartments.

This is the latest in our lookbooks series which provides visual inspiration from Dezeen's archive. For more inspiration see previous lookbooks showcasing bedrooms with clever storage solutions interiors that use mirrors to maximise space and compact bedrooms.

House H Taiwan by KC Design Studio

A dark and gloomy aesthetic was channelled by KC Design Studio when overhauling the formerly neglected basement of this apartment in Taipei.

The studio carved several openings into the ceiling of the basement to filter light into the interior. One large rectangular opening at the front of the apartment allows light to funnel from the ground floor's facade while also hosting a staircase while an L-shaped opening at the rear was topped with gridded sheets to circulate air between the ground and basement floor.

Plants were added below to create pops of colour.

Matryoshka House the Netherlands by Shift Architecture Urbanism

Formerly a derelict four-storey residence Matryoshka House was overhauled by Shift Architecture Urbanism after neighbours of the home were troubled by its neglected condition. The studio divided the home into two flats one of which occupies the two lower levels.

Shift Architecture Urbanism removed the rear walls of the home and replaced them with a full-height glazed wall that opens the basement level living areas onto the garden.

It used industrial and raw materials throughout the renovation incorporating concrete across the floors and unstained wood panels across the walls and inserting steel-wrapped volumes.

The Xbox Series X has been on store shelves for over a year now ...but the in-demand Microsoft console is still really tough to come by. And with the recent Microsoft acquisition of Call of Duty makers Activision Blizzard we wouldn't be surprised if there's now even more interest in both the Xbox Series X and S consoles than before. If you're one of the lucky ones that managed to pick up this powerful system during one of the restocks then you could be looking for some extra accessories. And you have plenty of options to choose from with some great controller and headset options out there plus a few different ways you can get extra space for games on your Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S. If you're looking for some accessories for the Xbox Series X Express.co.uk has rounded up some of the options you need to consider...

Get Xbox Game Pass for £1 £10.99 £1 View Deal Xbox Game Pass has been dubbed by many as 'the best deal in gaming'. For a monthly fee you get access to Xbox exclusives - such as Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5 - on Day One. Plus the ever evolving library adds tonnes of great third-party games each month like the upcoming Persona 5 Royal.

Best Xbox Series X accessories – Controllers Out of the box you'll have a single controller to use with your new Series X console. This latest design from Microsoft has been slightly tweaked compared to the previous generation with the addition of a 3.5mm audio port to headphones without an additional accessory and a dedicated Share button which can be used to take screenshots and video (or customised within settings to do anything else). But if you're looking to get an additional controller for your Xbox Series X then there are a few options from Microsoft you should consider. The most cost-effective option is getting one of the standard first-party Xbox Series X and S controller which comes in a range of colours. You can get these joypads in either the black or white that comes as standard with the Series X or S which is priced at £54.99.

Or you can get these controllers in some of the other colours Microsoft offers like Blue or Pulse Red. Once again these controllers will cost £54.99. But there are some other themed controllers out there that will fetch you back a bit more – such as the 20th-anniversary controller or the gorgeous Forza Horizon 5 joypad. Xbox joypads have long been known to be an extremely comfortable controller with great ergonomics that make it comfortable for playing for long periods of time. So going straight for a first-party controller – instead of a third-party one – is definitely your best bet.

Xbox Series X controllers are extremely comfortable but rely on AA batteries – unlike some others

If you want the best Xbox controller money can buy then the Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 will be the one for you. This controller is priced at £159.99 - which is just £90 less than the price of the Series S – so you'll need a hefty budget at your disposal. However you'll be getting what you paid for: the Elite Series 2 offers pro gaming quality that's built for performance as well as huge customisation options. You can remove parts and replace them with others to create over 30 different ways to use the Elite Series 2 controller. You'll also get adjustable-tension thumbsticks wrap-around rubberised grip and much more. And if you shop around you can find the Elite controller at a reduced price.

Xbox Design Lab UK prices begin from £59.99 to create your own bespoke controller

Another option we'd recommend to Xbox Series X owners is to head to Microsoft's Xbox Design Lab and create your own unique Series X and S controller design. This is something that sets Xbox apart from PlayStation which doesn't offer a way to tweak the colour palette of its accessories. In contrast Microsoft bundles a mammoth number of customisation options including rubberised grips the style of the D-pad the colour of the face buttons triggers and more. Prices begin from £59.99 for an Xbox Design Lab controller but rise depending on what customisation options you choose (such as personal engraving rubberised back grips and metallic colours). Still if you go for the base options that's not much more expensive than buying one of the standard Xbox Series X or S controllers - which is very reasonable given the huge customisation options at gamers' disposal.

The Xbox Wireless Headset is a great option for Series X and S gamers

Best Xbox Series X accessories – Gaming Headsets Microsoft Wireless Headset If you're after a headset for your Xbox Series X or S you have a wide range of options to choose from – with renowned third-party accessory makers like Turtle Beach Razer and SteelSeries all making Xbox headsets. Unsurprisingly one of the options is the Microsoft-designed Xbox Wireless Headset. Crafted by the same team that created the Xbox Series X it sports a similar design aesthetic that will fit perfectly with your console and controllers. This headset can be used on the Xbox Series X and S as well as the Xbox One and Windows devices. However if you want to use your new gaming headset with another console like the Nintendo Switch ...you're out of luck. It pairs directly with an Xbox console and offers support for spatial sound technologies such as Dolby Atmos. Unfortunately though you will need to purchase a license to use this feature - which is priced at £10.99. That's a real shame as we'd usually expect that to be incorporated into the cost of buying a dedicated headset – that shouts about its support for Dolby's clever audio technology on the box – for your new Xbox Series X. The official Xbox Wireless Headset is available at a pretty reasonable £89.99.

Xbox Wireless Headset £89.99 View Deal If you want a headset for those long all-nighters you've got planned for playing Halo Infinite with your friends then the Xbox Wireless Headset is a great option. Priced at £89.99 this device can easily pair with your Series X or S consoles as well as Xbox One machines. It also supports premium sound technologies like Dolby Atmos - but you'll have to pay for an additional license to experience this

HyperX Cloud Alpha Headset However if you want another option ...and one that works with other consoles in your collection look no further than the HyperX Cloud Alpha. This is a brilliant gaming headset that is compatible with all current-generation consoles including the Xbox Series X|S Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5. At its price point you'll struggle to find another headset that offers the same build quality and audio performance. Out of the box the first you'll notice about the Cloud Alpha is the subdued styling. There's not a single RBG light in sight! In fact this headset looks closer to the studio set of headphones than a gaming headset – for our money that's a huge advantage over the competition. If you need to take these headphones with you to plug into the 3.5mm audio port on a plane to watch movies without the terrible freebie headphones handed out by the flight attendants or want to use the headset to join a video call for work... nobody is going to bat an eyelid something that cannot be said for some of the competition. HyperX Cloud Alpha is available in a choice of Red Black or Purple. The latter has a white shell with purple accents on the arms and the headband cushion while the other two options are predominantly black. There's also a limited edition Cloud 9 variant that replaces the HX logo with the insignia used by the prominent esports organisation and adds vibrant blue colour to the stitching and metal arm.

The braided audio cable and detachable microphone ensure this headset is durable

The second thing you'll likely notice about the HyperX Cloud Alpha is the build quality. At £64.99 this is a mid-range headset but it feels much comparable to rival kit with a three-figure price tag. HP has used aluminium for the arms that secure the earcups which feels sturdy. There's a good amount of resistance when adjusting the sizing of the headband so you don't need to worry about the headset springing back to the default size when you take off the headset for a quick break. The leatherette memory foam padding used in the earcups for the HyperX Cloud Alpha are supremely comfy. During our testing we spent hours blasting through Zombies in Back 4 Blood talking constantly with teammates with voice chat and the Cloud Alpha never became tiresome. Despite the aluminium used throughout the design the headset remains pleasantly lightweight so there's minimal pressure on the top of your head. Those plush memory foam pads also provide some solid noise isolation during gameplay too. Even without active noise-cancellation the HyperX Cloud Alpha does a good job of ensuring that you'll always be able to hear the tell-tale sound of footsteps creeping up behind you the satisfying thud of a well placed shot or the thunder of an engine ...no matter what else is happening in the room around you. And that brings us nicely to sound quality. HyperX says that its Cloud Alpha headset is enhanced by its ""dual chamber drivers"" which are designed to provide less distortion. For our money it's difficult to tell exactly what the dual chamber design is doing to improve audio performance – but the HyperX Cloud Alpha sound great. There's a good amount of bass that provides a satisfying rumble without being too overbearing.

Unlike the headset designed by Microsoft HyperX will work will all current-generation consoles

The microphone is detachable – another good reason you'll be inclined to use the HyperX Cloud Alpha for more than just online gaming – and is certified by Discord and TeamSpeak. It boasts noise-cancellation to ensure that your voice will come through loud and clear even if you're not in a silent room. In every aspect of its design the HyperX Cloud Alpha feels like it has been designed with feedback from gamers ...rather than what a multi-national conglomerate thinks that gamers want. The 3.5mm plug means you won't need to upgrade to a new headset if you decide to upgrade from a PlayStation 4 to an Xbox Series X for example. Or if you buy a Nintendo Switch to play on-the-move ...the HyperX Cloud Alpha works too. Likewise PC gamers will also be able to take advantage of this brilliant mid-range headset. The braided cable and aluminium headband both feels incredibly durable – not a given at this price point. And of course most important of all the sound quality and microphone are solid. If you're looking for a good all-rounder gaming headset that won't be tied with one particular console in your collection the HyperX Cloud Alpha is a great choice. Highly recommended.

HyperX Cloud Alpha £79.99 View Deal This brilliant headset works seamlessly with the Xbox Series X|S as well as any other consoles in your collection aeroplane inflight entertainment systems work Zoom calls and more. The noise-cancelling microphone is certified by both Discord and TeamSpeak and the sturdy aluminium build feels more premium than you'd expect from its price tag

Best Xbox Series X accessories – Extra Storage If you have an Xbox Series X or S you may be looking at ways to expand your storage ...especially if you have the Series S model which arrives with a built-in hard drive that's half the size of the pricier Series X. Yes while the Xbox Series X comes with a 1TB SSD and the Series S has a 512GB SSD in terms of usuable storage (as crucial system files will take up space out of the box) the Series X has 802GB and the Series S has 364GB. And when you factor in the size of next-gen games – such as Forza Horizon 5 taking up around 100GB – then you may need to expand your storage at some point to install all the games you want to play. Features like Quick Resume which lets you suspend half a dozen games so they're ready to jump back into within seconds only works for games stored on the internal SSD or the official expansion card. This Microsoft-approved method is currently only being produced by Seagate. These cute little accessories may remind 90s gamers of the memory cards you'd need for the PS1 but instead of a few blocks of memory for save data these cards are loaded with state-of-the-art SSD storage. You can get a Seagate Expansion Card in 512GB or 1TB sizes. The RRPs are £159.99 and £219.99 but if you hunt around you can get these modern-day memory cards at a reduced price.

Amazon has been known to drop the price of the 1TB Seagate Expansion Card so keep a close eye on the retailer's storefront. And Amazon also stocks the 512GB Seagate Expansion card and the retailer has another option you may want to consider. As mentioned earlier if you hook up an external hard drive to your Series X or S you can't install next-gen games to play on it. You can store Series X and S games on an external hard-drive and if you want to play them you'll have to transfer it to your internal SSD. However there are a few things to point out. If you use an external hard drive you can put Xbox One Xbox 360 and original Xbox games on it and play these games without any impact on the features available. Of course you won't benefit from the super-fast load times and SSD offers but this will help free up plenty of space on your internal storage.

The Xbox Seagate Expansion Card will give you more space to play Series X and S games

And there's one competitively priced option you can turn to. This hard drive Express.co.uk recommends is the Seagate Game Drive for Xbox which offers a whopping 2TB worth of space. It's priced at £62.99 on Amazon (at the time of writing) - which is considerably less than the Seagate SSD cards - and also comes bundled with one month's access to Game Pass for free. If you're looking for a cost-effective way to free up space on your Xbox this is a great option. You'll still be able to play Xbox One 360 and OG Xbox games from this hard drive - while making space for Series X and S games on your internal SSD. Plus interestingly in our tests Express.co.uk found the Quick Resume Series X and S feature even works on games installed on this non-SSD external hard drive. Certain games which required internet connection at start up broke Quick Resume but for other games it worked flawlessly.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkZWFsaG9tZS5jby51ay9uZXdzL2RpeS1wbGF5cm9vbS0yNDc3NjnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Savvy Mum transforms garage into a colourful DIY playroom,"Having space for the kids to learn and play in the home is important.

Nicole Roberts from Newport Shropshire saved up for years to convert her garage into a dream playroom for her two children.

'This room was originally a garage but I knew before I move in that I wasn't keeping it as a garage' Nicole told money-saving community LatestDeals.co.uk. 'New builds lack storage and I needed the extra room for the kid's toys and other bits.'

(Image credit: Future PLC /Nicole Roberts/ LatestDeal.co.uk)

Nicole paid a builder to remove the garage door bricking up the front adding in insulation and plastering the walls. However they used friends and family wherever they could to keep costs down.

'My partner is an electrician so we saved on that as he did all the electrics. We also had a family friend plaster the walls' says Nicole. The whole conversion took a week and cost around £5000.

After painting the walls in Dulux white paint and adding in the carpet all that was left was for Nicole to release her colourful vision on the space.

'I knew from the beginning that this room needed to be bright and colourful' Nicole explains. 'What better way to achieve that than with a rainbow theme.'

Nicole started by adding in storge and furniture from IKEA to keep the kids toys in order. 'In total the storage cost around £250 but it was worth every penny' she explains. 'They are fab for holding so many toys.'

'I then started thinking about how I could make the walls less bare without having to paint them. I bought the rainbow sprinkle stickers from a small business called kiddysticks and they cost around £20.' Nicole also invested in some alphabet and number train stickers.

(Image credit: Future PLC/ Nicole Roberts/ LatestDeal.co.uk)

The little home corner complete with kitchen and washing machine is a gorgeous touch. 'I loved the idea of the kids having their own little home corner with the washing machine and the kitchen and market stall' explains Nicole.

She picked up the kitchen from eBay for £60 and a washing machine that cost £25 from Asda. The market stall was the finishing touch which she ticked up from Aldi for £20.

(Image credit: Future PLC /Nicole Roberts/ LatestDeal.co.uk)

The finishing touch was the handmade rainbow rug that she brought from a small business called HeidiBaskets Crochet.

Amazingly Nicole spent £450 on transforming the former garage. And the kids love it.

'The kids' reaction to this becoming their room was amazing' says Nicole. 'They couldn't believe it was all theirs! This is my favourite room in the house as it's so bright and cheerful. It's also very easy to keep tidy as everything is labelled.'

The permit will allow Exxon to begin construction and operation of its Yellowtail project the latest of up to 10 expected to be producing oil this decade. A final decision by Exxon on funding the project is pending.

An Exxon spokesperson confirmed the approval.

Since Exxon and partners Hess Corp and CNOOC Ltd started exploring off the coast of the Guyana in 2015 they have found more than 10 billion barrels of oil and gas.

Yellowtail was the consortium's 13th discovery in the Stabroek block an area covering 6.6 million acres (26800 square kilometers) and one of the largest oil finds in South America.

When output begins in 2025 the project would pump up to 250000 barrels of oil and gas per day the company has said. Exxon has proposed a development plan for Yellowtail that would require up to three ships drilling up to 67 wells.

The Guyana EPA permit prohibits routine flaring and venting of natural gas during operation and requires Exxon to keep an undersea device called a capping stack that can seal a well in event of an accident according to a statement by the Guyana EPA.

It also required that the partners have insurance to cover any environmental damages and provide a guarantee that indemnifies Guyana in event the consortium fails to meet their obligations the EPA said.

Earlier this year Exxon started up a new floating production storage and offloading vessel that will bring the group's oil production capacity this year to more than 340000 bpd.

In last week’s column I had focused on those reputational risks which confront ExxonMobil and are not risks directly arising from its performance in regard to global climate change and energy transition. Today’s column addresses this omission in my coverage. Readers would recall that last week I referred to three such reputational episodes; namely 1) Recent activists’ challenges over the Membership of ExxonMobil’s Board of Directors; 2) the company’s 2020 removal from the Dow Jones index; and 3) the recent significant slippage in its Fortune 500 performance on the list of companies for 2021. While each of these reputational episodes can be separately rationalized their coming together over the 2020-2021 period has certainly aroused a noticeable rise in the level of investor concern over the commercial standing of ExxonMobil. Before leaving this topic I refer briefly to a fourth such episode in the following paragraph.

Reputational Episode 4

Given the massively disruptive 2020 pandemic Bloomberg and Investopedia have produced brief analyses on trends in zombie firms. Both report that these trends reveal that hundreds of corporations had arrived at zombie status adding about US$1 trillion of debt to balance sheets. Indeed the total zombie debt for the US is estimated at just under US$2 trillion; the highest ever.

However the significant observation for us is that while firms can and do exit their zombie status as many as 60 percent of those that manage to do so end up being lower productivity and generate less profits and employment than their peers. This circumstance facing exiting zombie firms potentially threatens Exxon Mobil with on-going reputational risk.

The Task

After six years of reporting on Guyana’s emergent petroleum sector and deep immersion in analyses reports business and academic research studies of ExxonMobil as a private international petroleum corporation I am harshly critical of its company culture and role in dealing with global climate change and the energy transition. I shall offer my critique of the company in next week’s column. In pursuit of balance and fairness I devote the section below to a full and hopefully fair presentation of the corporation’s position on this topic. Of note I deliberately rely on Exxon Mobil’s own words as contained in its revised declaration on this topic [February 2022].

Exxon Mobil on Climate Change & Energy Transition

1. Net Zero Scenarios

According to ExxonMobil its concern over climate change has led to its announcement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the regulatory framework of the United Nations Conference of the Parties Summits. It therefore commits to halting CO2 emissions along with the ambition to achieve “net-zero.” Net-zero means its greenhouse gases emissions will be balanced by actions to remove same.

The company pledged to lead the global energy transition and has also pledged to achieve net-zero with respect to those emissions arising where ExxonMobil is the legal Operator.

ExxonMobil has also admitted that the success of its energy transition strategy is dependent on its ability to recognise and respond to key signposts of change in the global energy system on a timely basis as well as its corresponding ability to direct investment to the technologies and businesses at the appropriate stage in order to optimise its competitive strengths.

2. Greenhouse gas restrictions

In regards to greenhouse gas emissions Exxon Mobil observes that typically Government actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions vary including cap and trade regimes; carbon taxes and trade tariffs; renewable usage requirements; restrictive permitting on mileage and other efficiency standards; mandates for electric vehicles; mandates for use of specific fuels technologies as well as incentives designed to support transitioning to lower-emission energy sources. Alongside this political and other actors and their agents increasingly advance climate change objectives; for example to affect financing and investment in the oil and gas sector. They also take actions intended to promote changes in business strategy for oil and gas companies.

Depending on how policies are formulated and applied the policies listed above could easily affect investment returns as they affect directly the cost supply price and demand for hydrocarbon-based products

3. Technology and Low Carbon Solutions

Achieving reduced greenhouse gas emissions and net-zero require new technologies such as carbon capture and storage. For this and related purposes ExxonMobil has established a Low Carbon Solutions (LCS) business unit to advance the development and deployment of these technologies and projects. The company’s efforts include both in-house R & D and collaboration with leading universities and other commercial partners in this area. The document admits future results and success through the energy transition will depend in large measure on the success of these efforts and its ability to adapt and apply the strengths of its business model for providing energy products in a cost-competitive manner.

3. Policy and market development

Finally ExxonMobil suggests the size and scale of the world’s energy system means that in addition to developments in technology as discussed above a successful energy transition will require appropriate support from governments and private participants throughout the global economy. The ability to develop and deploy lower emission energy technologies at commercial scale and the growth and future returns and other businesses will depend in part on the continued development of supportive government policies and markets. Failure or delay of these policies or markets to materialise or be maintained could adversely impact these investments. Policy and other actions that result in restricting the availability of hydrocarbon products without commensurate reduction in demand may have unpredictable adverse effects including increased commodity price volatility; periods of significantly higher commodity prices and resulting inflationary pressures; as well as local or regional energy shortages. Such effects in turn may depress economic growth or lead to rapid or conflicting shifts in policy by different actors with resulting adverse effects on our businesses.

Supporters of Just Stop Oil began the action in the early hours of Friday morning at refineries near London Birmingham and Southampton by climbing on to tankers and gluing themselves to roads.

The activists continued to disrupt oil terminals on Saturday morning and said they had gained access to further sites.

Essex police said officers arrested a total of 83 people after protests in the Thurrock district.

The force said 63 were arrested on Friday following protests in Oliver Road Grays London Road Purfleet and Askew Farm Lane Grays. Another 20 people were arrested on Saturday in Oliver Road and Stoneness Road Grays.

Police said they were arrested on suspicion of a variety of offences. Officers are continuing to engage with protesters in Oliver Road Stoneness Road and London Road.

Assistant chief constable Rachel Nolan said: “Our officers are continuing to work in exceptionally challenging circumstances with a view to bringing these protests to a safe and swift conclusion. I would like to thank businesses local drivers and workers for their continued patience while we carry out our work.”

The group announced on social media that they had blocked Navigator terminals in Essex posting photos of protesters in hi-vis jackets on top of a tanker and others blocking a road with a banner reading “Just Stop Oil”.

They said protesters had blocked access to the Titan Truck Park and revealed a secret underground network of tunnels leading to the site. The development means the main and emergency access roads to the critical oil terminals are closed.

“We need the government to stop funding new oil projects and we need it now! Our only means of highlighting this issue is mass civil resistance” they said in a post on Instagram.

The group is demanding the government end the expansion of new oil and gas projects. Just Stop Oil said this week’s campaign was part of a transition from using tactics of civil disobedience to exercising civil resistance.

Explaining what this shift would look like one supporter told the Guardian last month that it would mean “stopping pointing out what the government should or shouldn’t be doing [and instead] actively stopping government doing what they shouldn’t be”.

The campaign which has involved protesters being glued to roads suspended on bamboo tripods and locked on to oil drums and each other is taking place in defiance of a temporary high court injunction banning protests outside oil terminals.

Outside Kingsbury and on roads leading to the site posters said: “Temporary high court injunction in force. Blocking slowing down obstructing or interfering with traffic on to this road as part of protest activity by Just Stop Oil Extinction Rebellion Insulate Britain movements and other connected movements is strictly prohibited. Failure to comply with the injunction may lead to imprisonment.”

As a result of the blockades the oil pipeline distribution network ExxonMobil UK closed down three of its terminals. Police from at least five forces were deployed to deal with the protests making arrests for offences including aggravated trespass criminal damage and obstructing the highway.

The Metropolitan police arrested 14 activists who broke into a facility at Bedfont Road in Staines Surrey and West Midlands police arrested six people at a terminal in Tyburn Birmingham.

Police said arrests were made for offences including aggravated trespass criminal damage and obstructing the highway.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vZGVtZXJhcmF3YXZlcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8wMi9wcml2YXRlLXNlY3Rvci1jb21taXNzaW9uLXdlbGNvbWVzLWFudGktc3BpbGwtZmluYW5jaWFsLXNhZmVndWFyZHMtZm9yLXllbGxvd3RhaWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Private Sector Commission welcomes anti-spill financial safeguards for Yellowtail,"Last Updated on Saturday 2 April 2022 21:39 by Denis Chabrol

The Private Sector Commission (PSC) on Saturday said it was satisfied that the environmental authorisation of the Yellowtail oil production project requires the ExxonMobil-led consortium to have emergency equipment in Guyana to cap a well should there be a blowout at the offshore project.

“The PSC is pleased with the Oil Spill Response and Financial Assurance provision in the permit which requires EEPGL (Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited) to procure a Capping Stack to be maintained tested and stored in Guyana as this will ensure that operators are in a state of readiness to cap any well in the event of a disaster” the PSC said.

Guyana’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explained in announcing the grant of its Environmental Authorisation for Yellowtail that among the notable conditions the Permit requires EEPGL to procure a Capping Stack to be maintained tested and stored in Guyana.” The EPA explained that a capping stack is a large well closure device that connects to the top of the blowout preventer (BOP) and is capable of sealing off a well.

Additionally the EPA said EEPGL must maintain access to at least one overseas subscription service to allow mobilization of a Capping Stack to the project location. This serves to fortify safety and emergency response efforts since wells would be swiftly capped in the event of a well blow-out.

The PSC also expressed satisfaction that that flaring has been incorporated into the Yellowtail permit with specific detail but urged EEPGL to have spare equipment on standby should there be a malfunction and so avoid gaseous pollution. “We would also like to see an effective Contingency Plan put in place (such as having a spare compressor on hand) to address any mechanical failure that may occur in

the future that will limit flaring to the approved limits as specified in the permit” the private sector body said.

The umbrella business organisation also welcomed the undisclosed financial assurance by the ExxonMobil majority-owned EEPGL to fund the damage cleanup and restoration as a result of an oil spill. “Further the Commission appreciates the fact that the Financial Assurance provision holds EEPGL liable for all costs associated with clean up restoration and compensation for any pollution damage which may occur as consequence of the Yellowtail Development Project” the PSC said.

The EPA and EEPGL are expected to ink an agreement to cover the financial assurance by EEPGL after the company provides an estimate of response cleanup restoration and compensation should there be disaster in the Stabroek Block an official said Saturday. EEPGL according to the official was yet to say how much insurance would taken out for the Yellowtail project as each project has to be insured separately.

As far as the financial assurance is concerned ExxonMobil estimates that EEPGL is valued about US$5 billion while their parent companies are in the hundreds of billions of US dollars. The official said EPA hoped to finalise insurance and assurance matters with EEPGL very soon ahead of the commencement of undersea preparatory work for the arrival of another Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel.

The EPA said the Permit also ensures that EEPGL is held liable for all costs associated with clean up restoration and compensation for any pollution damage which may occur as consequence of the project. EEPGL is also required to have Financial Assurance which includes a combination of Insurance which must “cover well control and/or clean up and third-party liability on terms that are market standard for the type of coverage” and a Parent Company/Affiliate Guarantee Agreement which indemnifies and keeps indemnified the EPA and the Government of Guyana in the event EEPGL and its co-Venturers fail to meet their environmental obligations under the Permit. “Further the financial assurance provided must be guided by an estimate of the sum of the reasonably credible costs expenses and liabilities that may arise from any breaches of this permit. Liabilities are considered to include costs associated with responding to an incident clean-up and remediation and monitoring” the EPA added.

In seeking to ensure EEPGL meets its obligations to prevent and mitigate environmental harm the Permit imposes comprehensive requirements for monitoring and management of any impacts affecting biological physical and socio-economic resources within the Area of Influence of the project including targeted and updated environmental baseline studies. The Permit also requires EEPGL to submit safety case information including a risk assessment prior to drilling and development of wells according to the EPA.

The Yellowtail Development will be located 203 kilometres north-east off the coast of Georgetown Guyana to a water depth in the project area ranging from 1700 metres to 1900 metres.

Yellowtail-1 well encountered 89 metres of oil-bearing sandstone reservoir and Yellowtail-2 well encountered 21 metres of net pay in newly identified oil-bearing reservoirs among the original Yellowtail-1 intervals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8wMi9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS93YXktY2xlYXItZm9yLWV4eG9ucy15ZWxsb3d0YWlsLXByb2plY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Way clear for Exxon’s Yellowtail project,"ExxonMobil was yesterday cleared for its fourth well offshore after the government issued a production licence two days after the EPA granted a stoutly contested environmental permit for what will be the largest oil extraction operation yet in Guyana’s waters.

The speed with which the production licence followed the environmental clearance will underline concerns here that the government and ExxonMobil are moving to extract oil at breakneck speed no matter the environmental and climate concerns that persist.

In its statement yesterday the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said “The approval comes after the EPA considered public inputs during all statutory periods for public consultations and review. The EPA also took into consideration the technical review and recommendations from a team of Independent International Experts and the Environmental Assessment Board (EAB). The EAB reviewed and declared the revised EIS (Environmental Impact Study) acceptable and provided recommendations for EPA’s approval as part of the environmental permit.”

It argued that the permit comprehensively address-ed all environmental and social safeguards that are reasonably necessary to protect human health and the environment; including implied conditions as provided for in section 13 of the EPA Act.

The permit strictly prohibits routine flaring and venting and specifies that flaring is only permissible during commissioning start-up and special circumstances. It stipulates that flaring should not exceed a cumulative 60 days during the startup phase. ExxonMobil’s subsidiary Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL) is mandated to notify the EPA of the expected duration and flaring volumes expected during the start-up and commission phases at least six months before commencement.

The Permit also goes further to maintain payments in instances where flaring is conducted beyond permitted durations.

“The Permit Holder shall pay US$45 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) emitted as a result of flaring in excess of the periods of flaring expressly stipulated…” the permit stated.

It added “Nothing contained herein shall be interpreted to mean that the Agency rescinds its authority to revise the rate of US$45 per tonne established by Condition 3.13 for the emission of CO2e for any period of continuous flaring beyond sixty (60) days to order the cessation of all flaring or take any other course of action provided by the Environmental Protection Act Cap 20:05.”

The Permit requires EEPGL to procure a Capping Stack to be maintained tested and stored in Guyana. A capping stack is a large well closure device that connects to the top of the blowout preventer (BOP) and is capable of sealing off a well. It is a form of modern technology (available post the Gulf of Mexico Macondo incident) to cap a well in event of a loss of well control and failure of the blowout preventer (BOP).

Additionally EEPGL must maintain access to at least one (1) overseas subscription service to allow mobilization of a Capping Stack to the project location. This serves to fortify safety and emergency response efforts since wells would be swiftly capped in the event of a well blow-out.

The permit also addresses financial liability in the event of an oil spill – something that has been contentious between government and critics. It stipulates that EEPGL must comply with the polluter pays principle. It adds that EEPGL shall bear all costs of the restoration rehabilitation and compensation required as a result of damage owing to an oil spill.

“The Permit Holder shall provide and/or declare within reasonable time upon signing of this permit a combination of the following forms of financial assurance to cover all its legitimate liabilities under this permit. These shall include: (a) insurance in accordance with Condition 14.5 and shall cover well control and/or clean up and third-party liability on terms that are market standard for this type of coverage; (b) a Parent Company/Affiliate (of operator and Co-Venturers (CoVs)) undertaking that provides indemnification for liabilities under this Permit.”

The financial assurance provided must be guided by an estimate of the sum of the reasonably credible costs expenses and liabilities that may arise from any breaches of this permit. Liabilities are considered to include costs associated with responding to an incident clean-up and remediation and monitoring.

EEPGL is required to submit to the EPA copies of its environmental liability insurance policies; a summary of the environmental liability insurance policies detailing the insurer type of insurance amount of coverage key terms types of environmental damage the policies fail to cover and duration of each policy; evidence that the insurer is authorized to operate in Guyana among other evidence relating to the insurer’s capabilities to execute the policies.

The Permit imposes comprehensive requirements for monitoring and management of any impacts affecting biological physical and socio-economic resources within the Area of Influence of the project including targeted and updated environmental baseline studies. The Permit also requires EEPGL to submit safety case information including a risk assessment prior to drilling and development of wells.

EEPGL is also enjoined to establish and maintain a Grievance Mechanism in keeping with the World Bank’s Approach to Grievance Redress in projects to ensure that complaints from individuals and communities who may be affected by the project are received and addressed. There is a requirement for reporting same and what actions were taken to address the grievances to the EPA.

In a statement issued a few hours after the EPA’s announcement of its approval of the environmental permit the Ministry of Natural Resources said that the government and EEPGL signed the Petroleum Production Licence (PPL) for the Yellowtail offshore development in the Stabroek Block yesterday.

Extensive reviews

“The Yellowtail project approval was a result of extensive reviews done by local and international experts. Prior to the appro-val the Government of Guyana contracted Bay-phase Oil and Gas Consul-tants and the Redford Group headed by Ms Alison Redford and a team of technical experts to review the Yellowtail Development Plan in keeping with internationally recognised standards within the oil and gas industry” the statement informed.

Redford is a controversial former Canadian politician. She served as the former premier of the province of Alberta and subsequently stepped down in 2014 after two and a half years following a series of questions about her leadership and controversy over expenditure on plane tickets.

She had also worked with the PPP/C government on the review of the Payara oil field. Questions were raised about her technical qualifications to conduct the review which had prompted the government to later defend her hiring stating that she would be leading a team of experts.

In its statement yesterday the ministry said that the team of technical experts assessed the project to ensure that all relevant regulations are complied with and that they can be enforced. This included environmental standards and reservoir management for the sustainable and responsible operation of the project in conformity with the best international standards and environmental safeguards associated with a project of such magnitude.

“Natural Resources Minister Hon. Vickram Bharrat M.P. stated that the government and its regulatory agencies are satisfied with all the reviews and long hours invested by both local and international experts to finally have a licensing agreement for the Yellowtail Project which will benefit all Guyanese realizing the ‘One Guyana’ vision.

“Additionally this project will build on the recently sanctioned local content legislation for each stage of the project as it relates to workforce development supplier development and overall strategic investment. The Government of Guyana remains committed to managing and extracting Guyana’s oil and gas resources sustainably in keeping with internationally recognized acceptable environmental standards and transparency” the statement said.

According to the government the project is expected to produce up to 250000 barrels of oil per day after startup in late 2025 using the ‘One Guyana’ floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel. The US$10 billion development project will target an estimated resource base of about 900 million oil-equivalent barrels and this is now the largest single investment in the history of Guyana. The name `One Guyana’ is drawn from President Irfaan Ali’s campaign for national unity.

Twenty-year duration

The Yellowtail project is ExxonMobil’s and its partners’ fourth development in the Stabroek Block and is considered the largest undertaking since Guyana became an oil-producing nation in December 2019. As part of the Yellowtail Project ExxonMobil plans to drill between 45 and 67 wells for the 20-year duration of the investment. It is intended to be the largest of the four developments with over 250000 barrels of oil per day targeted once production commences. Based on the schedule once approval is granted engineering commences this year and production in the latter part of 2025.

Exxon through its consultant – Environmental Resource Management (ERM) applied to the EPA for an environmental permit to operate in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana. It has since submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and other ancillary documents as part of the process and held public consultations. The statutory period for the public to submit objections expired in December last year and saw a number of environmentalists and other stakeholders objecting to the project as well as questioning the ERM’s independence.

At the end of February Executive Director of the EPA Kemraj Parsram had told Stabroek News that the agency advised ERM to present a revised EIA following an independent review.

Just on Tuesday Chairperson of the Environmental Assessment Board (EAB) – which adjudicates appeals of EPA decisions – Pradeepa Bholanath told Stabroek News that ERM had submitted its revised EIA approximately two weeks ago. However she could not say whether the revised document addressed the issues raised by the EPA as well as the other stakeholders.

Nevertheless the EPA apparently approved the EIA and granted ExxonMobil and its affiliates the environmental permit less than 24 hours after Bholanath had said that EAB was yet to make a decision on the revised environmental study.

Though the environmental permit for the Yellowtail development was granted on March 30 2022 and signed by Parsram and ExxonMobil Guyana’s President Alistair Routledge the EPA kept mum on the approval and only released the information yesterday afternoon – 2 days after granting the permit.

In fact the EPA released the revised EIA a public notice informing of the approval of the permit and the actual environmental permit granted to EEPGL on its website yesterday afternoon.

In its public notice the EPA said “The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hereby notifies the general public that the Yellowtail Development Project Stabroek Block Offshore Guyana has been approved pursuant to section 12 of the Environmental Protection Act Cap. 20:05 based on the following grounds:

“1. The Environmental Assessment Board has considered the Environmental Impact Statement and Environmental Impact Assessment related to this project acceptable in accordance with section 11(13) of the Environmental Protection Act Cap. 20:05. 2. The EPA has taken all relevant considerations into account including the views expressed by members of the public during consultations done in accordance with section 11(9) of the Environmental Protection Act Cap. 20:05.”

The EPA’s notice indicates that the three-member Environmental Assessment Board met sometime after 5 pm on Tuesday (March 29) and gave its approval of the revised impact study. There is no time stamp as to when the permit was issued just the date of March 30 2022 is stated.

Observers have previously pointed out that the EAB members are all employees of the government. Bholanath is the Senior Director for Climate and REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) in the Ministry of Natural Resources while Joslyn McKenzie is the Permanent Secretary of the same ministry. Dr Garvin Cummings is the Agriculture Ministry’s Chief Hydrometeorological Officer. The government has been pressing for swift approvals for all of these oil wells.

Petroleum Production Licence

In January the government through the Ministry of Natural Resources invited proposals for companies to review the Yellowtail Project. In February the government had announced that United Kingdom-headquartered oil and gas consultancy Bayphase Ltd was contracted to conduct the review of the Yellowtail Development Plan. Bayphase also conducted the review of the Liza-1 Liza-2 and Payara projects in the Stabroek Block.

They were paid US$423360 for the execution of the contract and it is unclear when the review was concluded but yesterday the government announced that the Yellowtail project has been approved “with enhanced environmental safeguards and operator regulation by local and international experts.”

Permit

According to the environmental permit issued by the EPA Exxon and its affiliates submitted their application on April 1 2021 while its national oil spill contingency plan the revised EIA Environmental and Socioeconomic Management Plan – which includes the revised oil spill response plan and wildlife response plan were all dated March 29 2022.

That means that those critical documents were submitted mere hours before the five-year environmental permit was issued. In the case of the Payara Development Project the application was submitted on December 04 2018 and the other supporting documents on July 22 2020. That permit was granted on September 24 2020.

Questions

The EPA did not release the issues it found with the first EIA submitted for the project. It is also unclear whether any of the objections raised by the various stakeholders at public hearing were addressed. The revised EIA was never released to the public for scrutiny until the permit had already been approved.

During the public comments phase on the study the EPA held a series of consultations as well as invited written submissions on the study. The public consultation process saw ERM attempt to answer questions and clarify aspects of the EIA for stakeholders but it also saw them failing to treat with certain questions.

During the final public consultation in November last year a number of environmentalists and activists railed at ERM for its failure to treat certain aspects of the environmental impact of offshore activities. For instance Jamaican environmentalist Diana McCaulay had called for the EPA to hold off on approving the project until it shares the EIA findings with other territories. Her Trinidadian counterpart Gary Aboud of the Fishermen and Friends of the Sea (FFOS) threatened legal action against Guyana if it fails to address certain aspects of the findings of the EIA.

A number of environmentalists and groups submitted objections to the EIA noting that the company failed to address a number of impacts on the environment. Also questions were raised about ERM’s ties to Exxon since it is the same company that did all of Exxon’s EIAs. They had also issued calls for the scrapping of the EIA.

Environmentalist Simone Mangal-Joly in a December 15 2021 letter the EAB Chairman Omkar Lochan on behalf of the Caribbean Coastal Area Management (C-CAM) Foundation The Jamaica Fish Sanctuary Network the Jamaica Environment Trust the Institute for Small Islands Fishermen and Friends of the Sea and Freedom Imaginaries argued that the EIA is “significantly deficient” as it fails to establish a baseline economic value of the coastal areas of the Caribbean including Guyana.

“We therefore call on the EPA to reject the EIA until minimum guarantees are established in Guyana” the letter had said.

Yesterday Mangal-Joly told Stabroek News that the 60-days comment period for the EIA was not honoured by the EPA because it never disclosed the Terms of Reference for the ERM study.

“This was chief among our complaints to the EAB. That release was made just as the 60-day expired. We are waiting for the EAB to instruct the EPA to trigger the 60-day comment and expect that whatever additional studies were done would be part of the public disclosure for comment” she said prior to the announcement of the granting of the permit.

She argued that the revised study ought to be part of the public register and that it is procedurally unfair to not give the public sight of it before a decision is made.

“Also the EAB still has not addressed many of the issues raised including the fact that ERM was not shortlisted as a firm to do an EIA in accordance with the procedures set out in the law. EPA Act has a clear process requirement” she said.

Following the announcement of the granting of the permit Mangal-Joly said that she will reserve any further comment until she has had the chance to scrutinize the documents.

A scan of the revised EIA revealed that very little has been noticeably changed and efforts to contact the EPA head to determine some of the changes that ERM has made were unsuccessful. Volume I of the initial EIA was 1382 pages while the revised one has increased to 1426 pages. There are no keys to which sections have been modified or where new information has been added."

From presiding over the design of retail boutiques residences and restaurants to managing large-scale private civic and institutional projects. In addition to his practice and stemming from a desire to challenge conventional architectural orthodoxy Stephen co-founded PHAT. The four-person multi-disciplinary design collaborative pursued work for exhibition and has shown in venues throughout the world. These spaces include the Studio Museum in Harlem the Architecture Center in New York and the Fonds Régional d’Art Contemporain’s Young Architects Exhibition in Orléans France among others.

Throughout Stephen’s career both in practice and academia he’s worked to bridge the gap between disadvantaged communities and advanced design. Working with and for not-for-profits like Watts House Project Findlay Market Youth Hope Cincinnati and Elementz Urban Arts Center he focuses on work that champions the disenfranchised and aims for the improvement of the built environment through sustainable and conscientious design.

As a first-generation college student Stephen earned both his Master of Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Architecture from The Ohio State University. He is now the newly-appointed Chair of Undergraduate Architecture at Pratt Institute where he will continue to challenge conventional architectural orthodoxy and show how architecture can be of benefit to everyone.

Today Stephen Slaughter is joining us for Friday Five!

1. Hale County Animal Shelter by Samuel Mockbee of Rural Studio

“Architecture is a social art… and as a social art it is our social responsibility to make sure that we are delivering architecture that meets not only functional and creature comforts but also spiritual comfort” said Samuel Mockbee.

Projects that inspire me are ones that are both beautiful and of service to the community they provide refuge to and represent. When I started looking at the role architects could play in the community I found and read Samuel Mockbee and the Rural Studio: Community Architecture and it became for me a model of how great design could be simultaneously taught and used as a tool to forge relationships with communities who have historically gone without. Hale Animal Shelter is a fine example of this.

2. Kara Walker

“I didn’t want a completely passive viewer. Art means too much to me. To be able to articulate something visually is really an important thing. I wanted to make work where the viewer wouldn’t walk away; he would giggle nervously get pulled into history into fiction into something totally demeaning and possibly very beautiful” said Kara Walker.

I love the work of Kara Walker and I think there’s no more fitting artifact that represents what it provides for me than a pitcher. Who’s thirsty?

3. Set for red black & GREEN: a blues by Theaster Gates

“A lot of the language around the environmental justice movement or the movement for racial justice might sound abstract or dry… trying to connect them to one’s own life is really the question. His techniques are really different. He adapts the material he finds into an artistically rendered poetic form” Marc Bamuthi Joseph said of Theaster Gates.

I saw red black & GREEN: a blues when it premiered in Cincinnati and was struck by how the stage was as much a character as the actors. An inspiring play about the role and perception of environmentalism in communities of color the stage was always moving always changing possessing a narrative arc of its own. Dynamic functional and beautiful with the capacity to communicate its purpose and culture all in the service of art. The play and Gate’s stage changed my life.

4. Windsor Farmers Market by Emily Pilloton of Project H

“We teach design thinking and vocational skills to apply to improving the local community” Emily Pilloton explained.

Like Rural Studio Emily Pilloton and Matthew Miller’s Project H provides opportunities to engage both students and communities in the process of design that includes and benefits all. Beauty is as necessary as satisfying the needs of the stakeholders they’re working for and with. Windsor Farmers Market is a great example of the synthesis between community engagement academic programming and beauty.

5. Deep Blue Sea by Bill T. Jones Diller Scofidio + Renfro Peter Nigrini

Bill T. Jones said “If you’d think about a large work like what you saw us rehearsing in the Armory is that going to make some people gasp’ oh my God how can they touch each other?”

The work of Bill T. Jones has been a touchpoint in every era of my life. From when my mother a breast cancer survivor was in one of his workshops for his seminal piece “Still Here” that I was fortunate enough to see take shape when he was in residency at Ohio State to when I was in Brooklyn for an interview and indulged myself by going to the Park Avenue Armory to see this epic performance. I think I’m attracted to situations where art life community and designed environments come together to tell a story. This story of Pip a minor black character in Melville’s Moby-Dick lacking in either agency or empathy required the most spectacular use of space light projection and bodies I’ve ever experienced. I was in awe at what a collaboration between a dancer an architect and a projection designer could produce.

“This was an exceptionally difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions & China zero Covid policy” CEO Elon Musk tweeted Saturday. “Outstanding work by Tesla team & key suppliers saved the day.”

Tesla reported that it produced 305407 vehicles and delivered 310048 vehicles in the first quarter. The vast majority of vehicles produced and delivered were Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. Tesla delivered 295324 Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. It delivered 14724 Model S and Model X vehicles.

The delivery figures were in line or beat analysts expectation depending on the polled group. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv showed expectations of 308836 vehicle deliveries while those polled by FactSet anticipated 317000. However production was down slightly from 305840 in the previous quarter due to factory shutdowns and supply chain issues.

Tesla’s first-quarter delivery and production report comes amid increasing pressure in China where a surge in COVID-19 cases has prompted the government to issue lockdowns. Tesla idled production at its factory Shanghai twice in March. Tesla’s Gigafactory Shanghai produces about 2000 vehicles daily mostly Model Ys and Model 3s for Chinese consumers and the European market.

Tesla has scaled its production compared to the same quarter last year as new factories come online. In the first quarter of 2021 Tesla produced just over 180000 vehicles and delivered nearly 185000 vehicles. Production should continue to ramp up now that Tesla’s new factory in Berlin has opened.

Tesla also said Saturday that it will report first-quarter earnings April 20 after the market closes. A live Q&A with Tesla management will follow at 5:30 pm ET.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJzc25ld3MubmV0L2J1c2luZXNzLzUzOTUw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla delivers over 1 million electric cars over past year | Business,"NEW YORK April 3 2022 (BSS/AFP) - US electric car manufacturer Tesla shipped a record number of more than one million cars over the past year according to figures published Saturday.

The company delivered 1.06 million cars from April 2021 to March 2022 including more than 310000 cars in the first quarter of this year alone which is 67 percent higher than over the same period last year.

Still the figure fell short of analysts' expectations of 317000 cars according to data compiled by FactSet.

Deliveries are considered similar to sales figures published by other manufacturers.

Growth however slowed sharply in recent months for the Austin Texas-based company with deliveries rising a minuscule 0.4 percent since the fourth quarter of last year.

The number of vehicles produced is also slightly down against the previous quarter (-0.1 percent).

""This was an exceptionally difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions & China zero Covid policy"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter referring to China's strict health restrictions. ""Outstanding work by Tesla team & key suppliers saved the day.""

However Tesla is still faring better than its competitors with the entire automobile industry affected by supply chains snarls.

Toyota saw its sales in North America fall 23.5 percent in volume in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period last year and 26.3 percent in value.

General Motors earned a profit of $1.7 billion for the quarter ending December 31 down 38.7 percent from the final three months of 2020 as revenues dropped 10.5 percent to $33.6 billion.",,,,,,,,,

FDX,FedEx,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpZXIub3JnL2FydGljbGUvYXMtZnJlZC1zbWl0aC1zdGVwcy1kb3duLWFzLWZlZGV4LWNlby1wcmVzaWRlbnQtYmlkZW4tc3RlcHMtaW4taXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Fred Smith Steps Down as FedEx CEO President Biden Steps In It,"About the great Fred Smith (founder and CEO of FedEx) there are more than a few stories that have followed him over the decades. Particularly as the star of what was formerly Federal Express began to rise it was often thrown around that a professor at Yale had given a C to Smith’s essay about a business that would offer overnight delivery anywhere. There’s also the one about Smith supposedly nearing payday without the funds necessary to make payroll only for the brilliant entrepreneur to play more than a few winning hands in Las Vegas such that his employees were paid.

Are the stories true or apocryphal? The view here is that the answers to the previous questions don’t matter. What matters is that one of the entrepreneurial greats of any era just announced that he’ll be stepping down as CEO of FedEx the remarkable company that he created. The stories don’t matter simply because any halfway clued in person doesn’t require them to know with certainty that Smith stared corporate death in the face far more than a few times since Federal Express opened its doors in the early 1970s.

How do we know with certainty that the previous assertion is true? We do because Smith is worth billions. That he is indicates that Smith not only discovered an unmet need in the marketplace but did so in stunning fashion. While New York Times columnist David Brooks has superciliously (and naively) written that “all I need is a hedge fund to get started” on the path to billionaire status in the real world the gut-wrenching road to “billionaire” is littered with terrifying risks taken seemingly insurmountable obstacles long nights full of worry that your business won’t be alive by morning and endless ridicule from the established – and flush with cash – commercial powers that be.

Smith’s billions are a certain signal that he endured all of the above and more. Indeed if Smith’s vision for giving all new meaning to delivery had been accepted as reasonable then it’s near certain that other much better capitalized businesses would have done as Smith did. That they didn’t is a reminder that the established transportation giants of the 1970s thought Smith delusional in pursuit of the impossible and likely both. Better yet those with jets and the capital access to acquire more jets likely never even considered the business line that Smith so deeply believed in.

I first became aware of Federal Express in 1978. My Aunt Kathy had gotten a job there. Please understand the context of Federal Express in 1978. Roughly 70% of Americans had never even flown on an airplane yet Smith was offering customers overnight delivery? By plane? The service was very difficult to contemplate considering the world as it was back then.

Please also consider the funding environment that existed when Smith decided to pursue the impossible. In 1969 the capital gains tax rate had been increased to 50%. And then in 1971 the dollar’s link to gold was severed by President Nixon; the latter an explicit devaluation of the dollar that logically coincided with soaring prices for the fuel that powers airplanes…A 50% tax on capital gains combined with the brutal tax that is a falling currency (when investors put wealth to work they seek returns in dollars) made investment in the bluest of blue chips (the S&P 500 rose 17% in the 1970s) a bit of a fool’s errand which means wildly capital intensive Federal Express brought all new meaning to intrepid investment.

Of course that’s why entrepreneurs are so different from 99.99999% of the rest of us. They see what microscopically few see. They believe deeply. The courage and resilience Smith had not to mention relentless devotion to his vision was surely otherworldly.

Where it gets interesting is that in reading this all of you are aware that FedEx (in 1994 the Federal Express was shortened) ultimately made it and made it big. But even then the story isn’t so simple.

FedEx was in many ways a documents company only for technology to theoretically rain on its brilliant parade. Figure that the fax machine had become commonplace in offices (and increasingly homes) by the 1980s and certainly 1990s. More than a few saw the machines as an existential threat to FedEx given the much greater speed that faxes could reach customers only for the Internet to rapidly become a thing by the late 1990s. The Internet quickly rendered the fax machine yesterday’s news but the value of FedEx continued to rise.

One guesses that in the face of these presumed threats to his business the opposite-thinking Smith saw opportunity. In an economy defined by relentless innovation of this kind abundant wealth would surely be the happy result; wealth that would lift boats of all sizes. And increasingly prosperous people want the fruits of wealth in speedy fashion. Basically Smith saw well beyond alleged obstacles to FedEx yet again only for his business to continue to prosper.

How fitting in a sense that Smith announced stepping aside on the day that President Biden rolled out a budget that included a large tax increase on billionaires. About Biden’s proposal Cato Institute co-founder Ed Crane (Smith was a Cato board member) emailed me to ask in joking fashion “What have billionaires ever done for us?” Crane knew well the answer to his own question.

Against the longest of odds billionaires rush a much better future into the present to all of our betterment. Fred Smith’s amazing accomplishments vivify this truth. As for the man in pursuit of cheap political points with his obnoxious tax it’s apparent that he’s still got some growing up to do at the age of 79.

It has teamed up with the San Francisco-based startup to begin trials designed to demonstrate pilot-free aerial shipments between its sorting centers with test flights to begin next year.

Like other big-name logistics companies such as DHL FedEx has been exploring the potential of robotics to streamline its operations heading into the future and now it is turning its eyes to the sky. It says its collaboration with Elroy Air actually stretches back to 2020 and now it is outlining plans to use that company's cargo drone as part of its middle-mile logistics operations.

Elroy Air's Chaparral aircraft carries its contents in a canoe-shaped container fixed to its belly and uses an electric-gas hybrid powertrain to achieve its impressive range. It is designed to pick up and drop off these tubs autonomously and FedEx plans to use the vehicle to move goods between its sorting locations to handle an important link in the supply chain.

Elroy appears to hope the autonomy extends to the actual packing of the cargo as well Elroy Air

“FedEx was built on innovation and we are always looking toward new technologies to help enhance the logistics industry through improved safety efficiency and customer service” said FedEx's Joe Stephens. ""We look forward to continued testing and learning throughout our collaboration with Elroy Air.”

While the timeline for the flight testing remains rather vague FedEx says the two will pursue certification and begin flight testing in 2023.

We weren’t just going to hang back where we were but everyone worked so hard on my JGR (Joe Gibbs Racing) Toyota Camry team. First and foremost I’ve got to thank my sponsors – SportClips FedEx Coca-Cola the Jordan Brand Toyota – such a huge partner of ours and our new sponsor – Logitech. Great to have them on our car now. You just have a tough season and things aren’t going well. It seems like everything is not going your way and the law of averages say things are going to work out and we’ll get our performance better and today’s the day where it all matched up.”

What is it like from your seat with a strategy race like that? “I just rely on the crew chief (Chris Gabehart) and his information to me says we are going to be racing this guy and this guy. As long as you run this pace and do everything you can in traffic you’ve got a great shot to win. I don’t pay attention to where we were or anything. He told me where the leaders were. I just drove the car as smooth as I could.”

What does it mean to you to win again at your home track? ""I love it. I love this track and the techniques that it takes to get around here. I watched some of the greatest short track racers in the world at Southside Speedway and Langley. I’ve learned so much from those guys watching from the stands. When I finally got the opportunity to apply it for myself I did.""

Kevin Harvick - No. 4 Mobil 1 Ford - Finished Second: “I’m just really proud of everyone on our Mobil 1 Ford Mustang for just staying in there and having a great strategy and doing everything that they did all day. It was really the first clean day that we’ve had all year. The cars have been fast and had a shot there at the end. I wanted to be close enough with the white to just take a swipe at him but the lapped cars kind of got in the way and I lost a little bit of ground. Still it’s a great day for us and hopefully a little bit of momentum in a positive direction.”

Stage points in all three stages for a solid day? “Yeah it was a good day. We kept chipping away at it and they had the right strategy to win the race and just wound up one short. We finally had a day where nothing went wrong.”

If the race went a little longer what would have been the result? “That wouldn’t have mattered. The race is what it is as far as distance. I’m just really proud of everyone on our Mobil 1 Ford Mustang. They did a great job. I was hoping to have a shot there when we took the white to be close enough to at least get to his bumper but I got stuck behind a couple lapped cars there and never really had a chance. It’s still a great day for us. The cars have run good all year. It’s really the first clean day that we’ve had with nothing going wrong so that’s a good thing.”

What is the takeaway with this car on a short track? “We’ve run good at both of them so hopefully that continues.”

William Byron - No. 24 Liberty University Chevrolet - Finished Third: “Thought we probably did the best job we could. It didn’t quite work out. I thought there at the end they told me I was just racing the 19. I’m like ok I got him but then the 4 and the 11 were on a totally different planet. That’s just part of it. There wasn’t anything I could do about them so it was probably four or five to go and Brandon (Lines) was coaching me on keeping the tires underneath it and having good exits and entries. Especially making those guys go around me on the top was definitely better. The times that guys would get underneath me was really really hard to get back connected and get a good lap put together. The middle of the race we were terrible and we just couldn’t get in the corner at all and if you can’t get into the corner you can’t put consistent laps together. It’s nice to have a run like we had today.”

Martin Truex Jr. - No. 19 Auto-Owners Insurance Toyota - Finished Fourth: How frustrating was it for you in the end with all of the different strategies? “It’s frustrating but it’s part of it. It’s part of the whole day. We did good there for a while. James (Small crew chief) did a great job all day with the strategy – getting us up-front getting us the lead. Our Auto-Owners Camry TRD was super-fast out front. Super-fast in clean air. At the end there I think we just tried to gamble on beating the 24 (William Bryon) and then he ended up doing our strategy and we both screwed up. Heads up the other way I think we had the best car but it doesn’t matter. Overall just really proud of our guys and big step in the right direction for Phoenix. Completely different mindset coming here after today what we can do going forward. Excited about that. Thanks to everybody at TRD Toyota everybody back at JGR (Joe Gibbs Racing) for working their butts off. Very strong day for our team.”

Kyle Larson - No. 5 hendrickcars.com Chevrolet - Finished Fifth: “I assume we netted out good with our strategy or better than we were. I didn’t think those guys the 11 and the 4 were going to get to us but then all of a sudden our tires kind of fell off a cliff there and got really slick. We just kind of had to nurse it home. Glad we got a top-five after three bad finishes in a row. We will move on to Martinsville and try to get a good run there.”

Christopher Bell - No. 20 Sirus/XM Toyota - Finished Sixth:

Ryan Blaney - No. 12 Menards/Richmond Water Heaters Ford - Finished Seventh (led most laps -- 128): “It’s tough. There were a handful of cars that could kind of run up and run in traffic pretty good and we just weren’t really good enough to run in traffic. Once we lost track position I struggled a little bit but it’s nice to win a stage. It’s cool to get the pole and good stage points. We finished seventh my best finish here. Overall a fun day. It was kind of frustrating because we were running so good early. I wanted to run better but I can’t complain about it too much. Overall not a bad day. We just have to find a little bit more speed but it was nice that we kind of put together some decent notes and have an OK run at Richmond.”

You had a back and forth with the No. 1. How did you view that exchange? “I was inside of him into three and I kind of got loose and washed up half a lane and we never touched. I went down into one and he just decided to send me so the next restart I sent him so now we’re even I guess.”

Kyle Busch - No. 18 M&M's Toyota - Finished Ninth:

Austin Dillon - No. 3 Breztri Chevrolet - Finished Tenth:

Chase Briscoe - No. 14 Mahindra Tractors Ford - Finished 11th: “We obviously had a really good starting position but in the beginning we fought a lot of balance issues and I think we fell all the way to 28th from fifth. It wasn’t looking the greatest but we just continued to get our car better. That’s definitely the farthest off we’ve been all year and to still be able to finish 11th is a good day. We got lucky and got a quick caution and was able to get the lucky dog and from there our car was actually driving pretty good and was able to drive up in the top five at one point. We just tried the gamble strategy with the win already and it didn’t work out. To finish 11th we probably could have run a little bit better if our tires had held on a little bit more but after being 25th at one point and a lap down with about 200 to go we’ll definitely take it.”

Brad Keselowski - No. 6 Violet Defense Ford - Finished 13th:



Daniel Suarez - No. 99 Commscope Chevrolet - Finished 16th: “It was a tough day. I just feel like we missed it the entire weekend. We didn’t have the speed yesterday. We didn’t have the speed in qualifying. Today was a battle. I feel like we were OK in the long runs at times but overall we just didn’t have a lot of speed. We just have to go back home and try to learn what we did right what we did wrong and come back strong.”

Joey Logano - No. 22 Shell/Pennzoil Ford - Finished 17th:

Harrison Burton - No. 21 Motorcraft/Quicklane Ford - Finished 18th: “It’s frustrating because I feel like we were better than 18th but track position is really hard to get here now. We struggled with being aero tight behind guys so it was really hard for me to kind of move forward throughout the run because of that. I felt like we had a pretty decent Motorcraft/Quick Lane Ford Mustang. If we keep going in this direction I feel like we’re getting a little better every time. It’s good to start running up with guys that we should be running with and building that direction.”

What happened late when you were three wide and smoked the tires? “I’m not sure exactly what happened. I know the 9 I think we were four-wide or something. There’s just not a lot of room so got hit and then smoked a tire but other than that a pretty smooth day so we’ll take it.”

Ross Chastain - No. 1 iFly/Onx Homes Chevrolet - Finished 19th:

A.J. Allmendinger - No. 16 Action Industries Chevrolet - Finished 27th: “That was a tough day. The guys did all they could to try to make our No. 16 Action Industries Camaro ZL1 better. I just fought super loose in and burnt the rear tires off it. I wasn’t ever able to get a good balance. We made the best of what we could it just wasn’t very pretty. Our pitstops were really good – our guys did a great job all day. I just need to be better so we will keep trying.”

Justin Haley - No. 31 Leaffilter Gutter Protection Chevrolet - Finished 29th: “We couldn’t catch a break today in our LeafFilter Gutter Protection Camaro ZL1. We bounced back early from our drive-through penalty but struggled with an ill-handling car for the majority of the day. We had a pit-road issue on our last green-flag stop which really sealed our fate for the end. I’m looking forward to getting to Martinsville and putting today behind us.”`",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3NldC5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2NvbnRlbnQvdmlyZ2luaWFzLWRlbm55LWhhbWxpbi1zY29yZXMtbmFzY2FyLXdpbi1hdC1ob21ldG93bi1yaWNobW9uZNIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3NldC5jb20vYW1wL3Nwb3J0cy9jb250ZW50L3Zpcmdpbmlhcy1kZW5ueS1oYW1saW4tc2NvcmVzLW5hc2Nhci13aW4tYXQtaG9tZXRvd24tcmljaG1vbmQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Virginia's Denny Hamlin scores NASCAR win at hometown Richmond,"Denny Hamlin hoped a visit to the track he watched races at as a youngster would help kickstart a season that started in an uncharacteristic fashion — poorly.

Thanks to some crafty tire strategy that his team timed right he got it done.

Hamlin ran down William Byron with five laps to go Sunday and ended the slowest start to a season in his career with a victory in the Toyota Owners 400 at Richmond Raceway.

“You just have a tough season and if things aren’t going well and it seems like the breaks aren’t going you way and then the law of averages say things are going to kind of work out and we get our performance better and today’s the day where it all matched up” said Hamlin who started the day 22nd in points.

In a race that featured four sets of green-flag pit stops and a whole lot of tire strategy Hamlin closed a huge gap between Byron and teammate Martin Truex Jr. passing Truex on the outside and Byron shortly thereafter. He then held off a challenge from Kevin Harvick a three-time winner at Richmond. “Yeah just great strategy there. Just drove as hard as I could” Hamlin said after climbing from his car. “There was no doubt in my mind maybe just a little but they got this car right there towards the end. Wow unbelievable.”

Hamlin’s 47th career victory was his first at his hometown track since 2016 the first for Toyota in the Next Gen car and gave NASCAR seven different winners in seven Cup Series races.

Harvick was second followed by Byron Truex and Kyle Larson.

“Had a shot there at the end” Harvick said. “I wanted to be close enough with the white to just take a swipe at him. Yeah the lapped cars there kind of got in the way and I lost a little bit of ground.”

Hamlin got himself into contention during the second stage when he and Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Christopher Bell opted to stay on the track while most of the rest of the field pitted for tires. The move initially gave the risk-takers a sizable lead but one that began evaporating quickly.

Hamlin made it pay off in the final stage going from 15th to seventh over just a few laps after a restart using the extra set of tires he had over the field.

Byron and Truex tried to make a similar strategy work at the end trying to race almost 90 laps on the same tires while Hamlin and Harvick and most others pitted with just under 50 laps to go. They almost made it work.

“At the end I think we just tried to gamble ... on beating the 24. He ended up trying to do our strategy which we both screwed up” Truex said. He was seeking his fourth victory in the last six races at the .75-mile D-shaped oval but instead Hamlin gave the current JGR stable 13 wins here.

Byron meantime declined to pit from the big lead he held when most of the field headed in under green with just over 50 laps to go. Truex did too but eventually Hamlin passed them both for his first top 10 finish of the season. He also snapped a string of 12 consecutive race winners under 30.

“I thought there at the end they told me I was just racing (Truex)” Byron said of his team. “I’m like ‘OK. I got him’ but then (Harvick) and (Hamlin) were on a totally different planet. ... There wasn’t anything I could do about them.”

ANGRY KYLE

Kyle Busch the fourth JGR team member was black-flagged with about 50 laps to go when NASCAR noticed a piece of tape on his grille. At the time his three teammates were running in the top 10 and he was closing in on joining them. He finished ninth.

FAST START

Ryan Blaney earned his third straight pole and led the entire 70-lap first stage and the first 128 laps in all but continued his struggles at Richmond.

“I wanted to run better but I can’t complain about it too much” Blaney said. “We just have to find a little bit more speed but it was nice that we kind of put together some decent notes and have an OK run at Richmond.”

Nick Firmino scored his first professional brace his first goals for ATL UTD 2. Deployed at right back Erik Centeno also tallied his first professional assist after crossing in Firmino’s second.

The first quality chance for Atlanta came in the 32nd minute with Austin Pack diving out of his six-yard box to punch out a Centeno cross from the right flank. The hands of Pack missed the ball which rattled off the body of ATL UTD 2 captain Robbie Mertz. However Mertz was unable to get a second touch and open the scoring.

The opening goal came in the closing moments of the first half after Hartford Athletic defender Tom Brewitt conceded a foul 30-plus yards away from his goal. Mikey Ambrose and David Mejía worked the resulting free kick short exchanging passes before finding Mertz near the left touch line. The midfielder sent a cross to the back post where Firmino headed in his first goal since signing for ATL UTD 2 a month ago. The header was also the Brazilian-American’s first goal in the USL Championship.

ATL UTD 2 showed its attacking prowess once again in the 58th minute passing through the center of the pitch to enter the Hartford box. Mertz found Centeno on the right who booted another cross to the back post. Firmino leapt over Hartford defender Younes Boudadi nodding down his second goal of the match past Pack. The brace is the midfielder’s first at any professional level.

Boudadi made amends in the 70th minute putting in a dangerous cross that bounced around the box. The effort looped off Noah Cobb and into the back of the Atlanta net for an own goal cutting the deficit to one goal.

ATL UTD 2 (2-3-0 6 points) returns to Fifth Third Bank Stadium to face off against USL Championship newcomers Detroit City FC on Saturday April 9 (ESPN+ 7:30 p.m. ET).

Like all its siblings everywhere in the Universe it’s too extreme to support life itself but the light and warmth it radiates supports billions of living creatures on a planet millions of miles away.

In itself the star is so fascinating that it requires literal armies of people to study it and we’re nowhere near understanding it. And not even those specialized armies seem not to be enough if we are to judge by an announcement made back in December by researchers at the University of Minnesota backed by NASA The general problem is the amount of data coming in from the hardware we already have in place to look at our star is too vast to handle. So help is wanted and where better to look than in our vast world among the hundreds of millions of people who own a computer of their own?The call to arms is simple: everyone with a dream of becoming astronomers and not only them can help scientists study the Sun. Not the Sun as a whole to be fair but something called solar jets.As most of you know by now the Sun is a very dynamic place. It erupts flares heats up and cools down and its direct reach expands far beyond what we generally perceive as being its surface. One way it does this is by means of jets nothing more than small and narrow bursts of hot plasma reaching out into neighboring space.A better understanding of this phenomenon could lead in turn to a better understanding of how the Sun works and how its activity has an effect on the conditions here on Earth. And the best way to do that is to compile the vast amount of data already available.Back in December 2021 the University of Minnesota asked for volunteers to join a Zooniverse citizen science project called Solar Jet Hunter (Zooniverse is “the world’s largest and most popular people-powered online research platform” a place where volunteers can join research projects).From home and using their own computers people were asked to comb through thousands of images of the Sun compiled in short movies snapped by the NASA Solar Dynamic Observatory over the last eleven years. Using only their eyes they had to spot instances of solar jets.Once spotted volunteers were asked to “provide information about the jets by annotating the images where solar jets are found.”The project is now listed as completed (but will be re-launched soon with a new set of images) and the numbers are impressive. Over 1500 amateur astronomers played this extreme-for-the-eyes game uncovering close to 34000 instances of solar jets meaning about 22 sightings per person.All this new information about the Sun’s activity over the past decade will be included in a database that is currently being built. Aside from the obvious scientific advantages of having such a database a partly automated algorithm for the detection of solar jets could be developed. One does not exist now leaving the task of finding them to the good old human eye.At a scientific level researchers speculate solar jets “could be linked to energetic particles and perturbations in the solar wind” and mapping their emergence could help prove or disprove that. Also having this data on record might help make better sense of the info coming back from the most recent spacecraft currently on mission to study the Sun namely the American Parker Solar Probe and the European Solar Orbiter.At the time of writing there is no info as to when the University of Minnesota will re-launch the Solar Jet Hunter project.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3MuaW5xdWlyZXIubmV0LzM0NDM4NC9iZWNhdXNlLXRoZS1iZXN0LW1hbi1mb3ItdGhlLWpvYi1pcy1hLXdvbWFu0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9idXNpbmVzcy5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQvMzQ0Mzg0L2JlY2F1c2UtdGhlLWJlc3QtbWFuLWZvci10aGUtam9iLWlzLWEtd29tYW4vYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Because the best man for the job is a woman’,"In a historically male-dominated industry like real estate women continue to rise up and prove themselves to be capable. It is through example encouragement and pioneering work that the powerful women in real estate have helped exact change and pave the way for younger generations to pursue their own passions in this industry as well.

From retail mass housing architecture to construction and interior design here are some of the women who have made a mark in the Philippine real estate landscape.

Rosemarie Bosch-Ong

Rosemarie Bosch-Ong is building a brighter future for the local retail industry. As president of the Philippine Retailers Association (PRA) Ong led the group and its more than 400 member-companies throughout the pandemic—one of the most difficult times faced by businesses in recent history. Over the last two years the PRA under her strong leadership had rolled out programs and webinars to provide timely help for local retailers reeling from the crisis. She also actively sought for support from the government to help protect retailers.

Besides her exceptional work at PRA Ong’s own success story easily inspires young women to pursue their dreams. Starting out in 1984 as a purchasing manager at Wilcon Depot she worked her way up the corporate ladder leading and inspiring in an industry dominated by men. Today she is best known for her exceptional contributions in Wilcon Depot as its senior executive vice president and COO for having played a key role in the growth of a company that has more than 4000 employees as well as for her prowess and fortitude.

Emma Imperial

Emma Imperial is the lady behind the first solar-powered low cost housing community in the Philippines.

Through Imperial Homes Corp. (IHC) Imperial made solar power more affordable and accessible enabling many Filipinos to benefit from clean sustainable energy in their communities. On top of this the homes are also built using a pre-cast technology offering a 100-year material lifespan. These homes are said to be earthquake- and fire-resistant as well.

Through these solar powered communities IHC became the first company to achieve the IFC’s EDGE certifications in the Philippines for its housing projects in Batangas. Today IHC has built over 20000 homes and was awarded the ACES Awards for Responsible SMEs in Asia.

Aida Cruz-Del Rosario

One of the first female licensed architects in the Philippines and in Asia Aida Cruz-Del Rosario set a precedent for future generations when she entered the College of Architecture at the University of Santo Tomas. In 1974 she became the college’s first female graduate and even placed 7th in the licensure exam.

At a time when women were barely seen in the field of architecture Cruz-Del Rosario pursued what she truly wanted and broke barriers. Partnering with her engineer husband Jose del Rosario she designed and constructed multiple projects across the country. Some of her notable works include the early campus of the University of Baguio and several houses in the City of Pines.

Dolly Perez

Known as the “mother of landscape architecture” Dolly Perez thrived as the first female landscape architect in the country at a time when her field was considered as glorified gardening.

She studied architecture at the University of Santo Tomas but chose landscaping as her design medium. After graduating from the University of California Berkeley with a master’s degree in landscape architecture she established Dolly Q. Perez and Associates in 1966. It later became Total Designs Atelier Inc. solidifying her place in a field that was still relatively young in the Philippines at the time.

Her works include Rizal Park Libingan ng mga Bayani Dambana ng Kagitingan in Bataan and over 200 residential gardens. She trained younger generations of students on landscape design through her teachings and apprenticeships in the University of the Philippines-Diliman. Today landscape architecture is already a recognized profession in the country thanks to pioneers in the field like Perez.

Alice Eduardo

Alice Eduardo president and CEO of Sta. Elena Construction and Development Corp. was dubbed a “woman of steel” for a reason. It was through sheer grit that she was able to build the construction firm now a multibillion-dollar company from the ground up as a woman who started with no background in engineering.

Traditionally a male-led industry construction and engineering have always been close to Eduardo’s heart. In college she wanted to pursue engineering but was not allowed by her parents who wanted her to go into law or medicine. She went into business administration instead and graduated with that degree from the University of Santo Tomas. While helping out in the family business a chance encounter with a client led her to dabble in the construction business.

Through hard work and firm relationships she and her team soon handled local and international clients including the SM Mall of Asia and other SM malls. Her portfolio also included subcontract work for infrastructure projects like bridges from Ilocos to Pangasinan NLEx and SCTEx and natural gas-fired power plants.

Jean De Castro

As the first-ever female chair of the Urban Land Institute Philippines one of the world’s oldest and largest networks of cross-disciplinary real estate and land use experts Jean Jacquelyn De Castro is changing structures in the engineering and construction fields.

Graduating magna cum laude in her undergraduate program and finishing fifth in her law studies the University of the Philippines alumna is an experienced litigation lawyer in her early professional years with a vast experience in construction arbitration and commercial litigation. This piqued her interest in real estate which eventually led her to follow her father’s footsteps in ESCA Inc. an engineering company founded by her family.

Today the CEO of ESCA Inc. has since been breaking barriers since the start of her career as she leads the company’s operations business development and administration.

Edith Oliveros

One of the pioneers of interior design in the Philippines Edith Oliveros fondly called “La Doyene” by her students was known for her contemporary design with a flair for tropical elements and Filipino style.

She graduated from the Philippine Women’s University with a home economics degree but because of her passion for design she eventually pursued a master’s of science degree in interior design at Drexel University in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. When she returned to the Philippines she started taking on young female apprentices and eventually helped establish Philippine School of Interior Design.

Among her most recognized works are the interiors of Admiral Hotel and the restoration of the Metropolitan Theater Manila. She also co-wrote several books including “Design in the Home” (1993) and “Interior Design in the Philippines” (2013).

On Friday the Pennsylvania winter utility disconnection moratoriums were lifted and shut-offs for nonpayment resumed.

""There are a variety of resources available to assist at-risk consumers and the first/best step consumers can take to explore these options is to reach out directly to their public utility"" according to Nils Hagen-Frederiksen press secretary office of communications Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.

""Customers who are in danger of termination know who they are. It is a long process to disconnect that includes 10-days written notice mailed out and subsequent phone calls and visits before someone ever comes out to turn off the power"" said Todd Meyers senior communications representative FirstEnergy Corp. Penelec merged with FirstEnergy in 2001.

According to Hagen-Frederiksen each major utility has a team of representatives trained to help consumers explore the many options that may be available and connect those families with the necessary resources. The utilities can explain about the assistance programs available in their communities for income-qualified consumers operated by utilities and non-profit organizations.

""The last thing we want to do is apply a late fee or issue a disconnection notice to a customer facing financial hardship when it can be avoided by simply giving our customer service team a call and explain their situation and see what help is available to them"" Meyers said.

Why:Energy costs rose 33% last year. Here's what to do to lower those bills in 2022.

Customers experiencing financial hardship are urged to contact their electric utility as soon as possible to establish affordable payment arrangements or obtain assistance he said.

""We find many customers are unaware of the help that is out there for them or may be embarrassed or afraid to reach out for assistance with past-due balances on their electric bill"" Meyers said.

In responses Penelec developed a campaign entitled “We’re Customers Just Like You” where personal experiences of the utility's employees are highlighted in a video he said. Additionally there is a bill assistance web page at www.firstenergycorp.com/billassist displays available programs based on income and household size Meyers said.

The most recent publicly available figure in a 2020 report from the Pennsylvania Public Utility placed the number of customers behind on their electric bills at around 56000 or 11% of Penelec's customer base.

Quarterback Nick Mullens started just one game for the Browns in 2021 — a narrow 16-14 defeat at the hands of the Las Vegas Raiders on December 20. On Friday the same team that eked the win out over Mullens in Cleveland signed him to a new contract.

Mike Garafolo of NFL Network reported the news via Twitter on the morning of April 1.

“The #Raiders have agreed to terms with QB Nick Mullens source says” Garafolo tweeted. “Right now it’s him and Garrett Gilbert behind Derek Carr so a good shot for him to land a backup gig.”

ESPN’s Field Yates reported later Friday that Mullens’ deal is for one year at a total of just over $1 million guaranteed with incentives that could bump his total earnings to $2.5 million.

Mullens Has Proven Competent NFL Starter Across Four Seasons

Mullens 27 was competent in his one start for the Browns completing 20 of 30 passes for 147 yards and one touchdown. Such has been the story of Mullens’ career across four seasons in the NFL.

The quarterback signed with the San Francisco 49ers in 2017 as an undrafted free agent out of Souther Mississippi spending the entire year on the team’s practice squad. He got his first shot in San Francisco in 2018 starting eight games and leading the team to a 3-5 record during those contests. He started another eight games for the Niners two years later with a record of 2-6.

All told Mullens has appeared in 20 NFL games and started 17 of those. His record as a starter is 5-12. Mullens has completed 64.6% of his passes amassing 4861 career yards and 26 touchdowns compared to 22 interceptions per Pro Football Reference.

After his time in San Francisco came to an end Mullens caught on briefly with the Philadelphia Eagles before that franchise cut him from its practice squad in late August 2021. He ended up signing with the Browns where he spent much of the year on the practice squad as QB3 behind starter Baker Mayfield and backup Case Keenum.

Quarterback Drama Persists in Cleveland With Watson Mayfield

Mullens and Keenum are now both gone from the Cleveland locker room which has been full of both turnover and drama since mid-March.

The Browns traded Keenum to the Buffalo Bills and then signed Jacoby Brissett to serve as backup to the newly-acquired Deshaun Watson. The moves seemed to render Mayfield’s presence on the roster superfluous though that may not prove the case considering Watson’s off-field troubles.

Two grand juries in separate counties in Texas recently decided that Watson would not face charges stemming from nine criminal complaints (one of which was filed in both counties for a total of 10) alleging the former Houston Texans quarterback engaged in illegal behaviors ranging from sexual misconduct to sexual assault. However 22 civil cases filed against Watson for the same alleged reasons remain active.

If Watson settles the cases before the season begins in early September Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio believes the QB is likely to face a six-game suspension. If Watson hasn’t settled those cases Florio said the league could decide to place him on paid leave for as long as the entire 2022 season enacting whatever suspension it decides on to begin the following year.

Mayfield first requested a trade out of Cleveland following the team’s initial meeting with Watson on Tuesday March 15. After initially stating they would not honor Mayfield’s request the Browns ended up signing Watson and began shopping Mayfield the team’s starter over the previous four seasons.

The trade market for Mayfield dwindled in the days that followed as several other franchises in need of a quarterback locked down their starters for 2022. Consequently Cleveland watched from the proverbial sidelines as more and more of its leverage in future trade talks for Mayfield evaporated. The Browns’ current position is that they will hold onto Mayfield and potentially start him for multiple games to begin the season if Watson is unavailable. Doing so could add value back to Mayfield as a trade chip as could an injury to another franchise’s quarterback which is all but guaranteed to happen eventually.

It’s also possible however that Mayfield gets traded before the regular season begins. Even posturing that Mayfield may be the starter in Cleveland to kick off the year could push his trade value higher. Currently the Seattle Seahawks are believed to be the most likely landing spot for the QB should such a deal go down though NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that the Seahawks aren’t like to take on Mayfield’s nearly $19 million contract unless the Browns are willing to a pay a portion of his salary.",,,,,,,,,

Dealers will replace the housing if needed. Owners will be notified starting April 18.

The trailer braking recall includes F-150 pickups from 2021 and 2022 as well as the 2022 F-250 350 450 and 550. Also covered are the 2022 Maverick pickup and Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs.

In a forthcoming book a pair of New York Times reporters and CNN political analysts report that President Joe Biden “assessed” Fox News “as one of the most destructive forces in the United States.”

The reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns say that Biden was even more critical of Fox Corp patriarch Rupert Murdoch.

According to the book Biden told an unnamed associate in mid-2021 that Murdoch was “the most dangerous man in the world.”

The description comes many chapters into “This Will Not Pass: Trump Biden and the Battle for America’s Future” which comes out in May.

The book describes Fox as a “torrent of anti-Biden programming stoking skepticism about vaccines and disseminating wild conspiracy theories about the January 6 attack.”

Many Biden allies have denounced Fox for those reasons and have blamed Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan the company’s CEO for enabling hosts like Tucker Carlson.

But Biden has never spoken about either Murdoch in public according to the Factba.se database of the president’s speeches interviews tweets and other public statements. So the comment in “This Will Not Pass” may make waves.

A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the book’s claim about Biden excoriating the elder Murdoch.

Biden sometimes tangles with Fox’s White House correspondent Peter Doocy and was caught on a hot mic in January calling Doocy “a stupid son of a bitch.” Biden then called him to apologize.

Biden also occasionally makes asides about Fox’s oppositional programming. Last October at a CNN town hall he said “I turn on Fox to find out how popular I am” winning laughs from the audience.

In a 26-page class-action complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Southern Florida attorneys Anthony J. Russo and James C. Kelly are representing plaintiffs who believe they were misled by the sandwich sizes that Burger King displays in its advertisements.

A spokesperson for Burger King told FOX Business that the corporation ""does not comment on pending or potential litigations.""

""Burger King advertises its burgers as large burgers compared to competitors and containing oversized meat patties and ingredients that overflow over the bun to make it appear that the burgers are approximately 35% larger in size and containing more than double the meat than the actual burger"" the complaint states.

KING'S HAWAIIAN BEING 'DECEPTIVE' ABOUT WHERE ITS ROLLS ARE ACTUALLY MADE LAWSUIT ALLEGES

It entered the FLSD docket on March 28 2022.

Attorney James Kelly told FOX Business that the complaint aims to get Burger King and other fast food chains to advertise their menu items in a way that reflects reality.

""We are ultimately seeking changes to the photos for the materially overstated menu items and fairness across the industry on the issue"" he said in an email.

The menu items that are named in the complaint for being ""overstated"" in advertisements include the chain’s iconic Whopper and King lines the breakfast-time Croisann’Wich (fully loaded and egg & cheese) and Double Sausage sandwich and other burger options that include bacon or cheese.

A spokesperson for Burger King told FOX Business in an email that the corporation ""does not comment on pending or potential litigations.""

The complaint requests a jury trial. It alleges that the discrepancy between the advertised sandwiches and the appearance of the menu items in real life is a ""deceptive trade practice"" that could be interpreted as false advertising.

HOW TO IDENTIFY FALSE ADS

Russo and Kelly name four plaintiffs in the complaint one of whom is from Florida; the other three are from New York.

The plaintiffs claim they wouldn’t have purchased sandwiches from Burger King if they were aware ""that said burgers were much smaller than advertised.""

At least 100 plaintiffs are included in this pending class-action lawsuit the complaint says.

""Burger King’s advertisements for its burger and menu items are unfair and financially damaging consumers as they are receiving food that is much lower in value than what was promised"" the complaint argues.

""Burger King’s actions are especially concerning now that inflation food and meat prices are very high and many consumers especially low income consumers are struggling financially.""

It has been expanded and republished timed to the film's premiere. ""Apollo 10½"" is now streaming on Netflix.

Chicago - Richard Linklater returns to his beloved rotoscoping animation format for this sweet nostalgia trip back to 1969.

Inspired by his own childhood in Houston in the 1960s ""Apollo 10½: A Space Age Childhood"" pairs a showy framing device about a kid astronaut with a slice-of-life look at suburbia on the edge of the Space Race. More narrated docudrama than narrative feature ""Apollo 10½"" does at times feel like an older relative monologuing at you about every minute detail from their childhood — from what they ate for dinner to what they watched on TV.

""Let me tell you about life back then. It was a great time to be a kid"" Jack Black's narrator explains early in the film.

But that myopia is also part of its charm. ""Apollo 10½"" luxuriates in the details of childhood some of which are universal (sibling rivalries stressful playground games) and some of which are deeply tied to this particular place and time (riding in the back of a pickup truck down the highway attending a school where everyone’s parents worked for NASA). Linklater and his collaborators clearly have an immense fondness for a time when science class felt like current events.

And while ""Apollo 10½"" will perhaps play best for those who have nostalgia for their own Space Age childhoods it’s also not a bad history lesson for a pivotal moment in American history as remembered by a less-than-reliable narrator.

Grade: B

Streaming on Netflix April 1. Rated PG-13. 98 minutes. Dir: Richard Linklater. Featuring the voices of: Milo Coy Jack Black Glen Powell Zachary Levi Josh Wiggins Lee Eddy Bill Wise.

It has been expanded and republished timed to the film's premiere. ""Apollo 10½"" is now streaming on Netflix.

Chicago - Richard Linklater returns to his beloved rotoscoping animation format for this sweet nostalgia trip back to 1969.

Inspired by his own childhood in Houston in the 1960s ""Apollo 10½: A Space Age Childhood"" pairs a showy framing device about a kid astronaut with a slice-of-life look at suburbia on the edge of the Space Race. More narrated docudrama than narrative feature ""Apollo 10½"" does at times feel like an older relative monologuing at you about every minute detail from their childhood — from what they ate for dinner to what they watched on TV.

""Let me tell you about life back then. It was a great time to be a kid"" Jack Black's narrator explains early in the film.

RELATED: The splashiest movies out of this year’s SXSW festival Vol. 1

But that myopia is also part of its charm. ""Apollo 10½"" luxuriates in the details of childhood some of which are universal (sibling rivalries stressful playground games) and some of which are deeply tied to this particular place and time (riding in the back of a pickup truck down the highway attending a school where everyone’s parents worked for NASA). Linklater and his collaborators clearly have an immense fondness for a time when science class felt like current events.

And while ""Apollo 10½"" will perhaps play best for those who have nostalgia for their own Space Age childhoods it’s also not a bad history lesson for a pivotal moment in American history as remembered by a less-than-reliable narrator.

Grade: B

Streaming on Netflix April 1. Rated PG-13. 98 minutes. Dir: Richard Linklater. Featuring the voices of: Milo Coy Jack Black Glen Powell Zachary Levi Josh Wiggins Lee Eddy Bill Wise.

They're certainly two of the most exciting Garmin watches around today thanks to their bright OLED screens which are much easier to see in all lightings conditions than the memory-in-pixel (MiP) screens of watches in the Fenix and Forerunner series.

However despite using the same screen tech these are two very different watches. The Venu 2 is a fantastic all-rounder with a good range of everyday smartwatch tools plus a great selection of sports tracking features. The Epix (Gen 2) on the other hand is a watch for serious sportspeople with advanced training tools designed to help you smash your goals and reach new personal bests. This difference is also reflected in the watches' prices; the Epix is around twice the price of the Venu 2.

That's just the fundamentals there are also a lot more differences to be aware of which we'll go through below. If you've already made up your mind though we've rounded up the very best deals on both watches right here.

Watch models and price

Watch models

Epix (Gen 2) available in two materials but one size

Venu 2 comes in 40mm and 45mm versions

Venu 2 Plus has 43mm diameter case

The Garmin Epix (Gen 2) is only available in one size (47mm) but comes in two variants: standard and sapphire. The standard version is slightly cheaper (which we'll explain in more detail shortly) and has a Corning Gorilla Glass lens a dark gray reinforced polymer case with stainless steel on the front and back. It's finished with a dark gray silicone band.

The sapphire edition has a titanium bezel and case back and a reinforced resin case in either white or black. The lens is made from tough sapphire crystal and you can choose a silicone band or upgrade to leather for an additional fee. At the time of writing the leather band isn't available in the US.

The Garmin Venu 2 comes in two sizes (40mm or 45mm) the smaller of which is called the Venu 2S. Both of these are more compact than the Epix (Gen 2) making it a better choice for slimmer wrists.

Like the standard edition Epix the Venu 2 has a reinforced resin case with a stainless steel back and bezel. It comes in a range of colors with different options for the two sizes.

In January 2022 Garmin released the Venu 2 Plus which has a case measuring 45mm in diameter. It's made from the same materials but there's also a premium version that comes with a leather band in addition to the standard silicone one. Again the leather variant isn't currently available in the US.

Price

Epix (Gen 2) is over twice the price of Venu 2

Venu 2 Plus is $50 more than Venu 2

Premium materials available for an additional fee

The Garmin Epix (Gen 2) is a premium smartwatch while the Venu 2 Plus is a mid-range model – and that's reflected in their prices.

The Epix (Gen 2) costs $899.99 / £799.99 / AU$1399 for a model with a stainless steel bezel and Corning Gorilla Glass covering the face or $999.99 / £899.99 / AU$1499 for a sapphire crystal lens and a titanium bezel.

There’s also a model with sapphire crystal and a titanium bezel plus a chestnut leather strap rather than the standard silicone priced at £999.99 / AU$1549 (but not currently available in the US).

The Garmin Venu 2 costs $399.99 / £349.99 / AU$629 for both the 40mm and 45mm versions while the Venu 2 Plus is $449.99 / £399.99 / AU$699 for the standard version and £449.99 / AU$749 for the one with a leather band.

Design display and battery life

Design

Epix (Gen 2) is more rugged looking

Epix has five buttons while Venu 2 has two

Venu 2 Plus has third button for microphone

The Garmin Epix (Gen 2) and Venu 2 both have the round face typical of most of the company's watches but the Epix has a more rugged look thanks to the exposed screws on its metal-covered lugs.

We've already discussed the two watches' sizes and materials but it's also worth mentioning their button layouts. The Epix (Gen 2) has the five-button setup that'll be familiar to Garmin Forerunner and Fenix users. The start/stop button at the top right is protected by a small metal guard to prevent accidental presses or damage/

The Venu 2 has just two physical buttons on the right-hand side of the case (one to select a menu option and one to navigate back). All other watch functions are carried out using the touchscreen though this is locked by default while you're tracking an activity to prevent accidental presses. The Venu 2 Plus has an additional button in between these two which activates the watch's microphone.

Display

All have bright OLED displays

Venu 2S has lower resolution than others

Touch interface is smooth and responsive

Both the Garmin Epix (Gen 2) and Garmin Venu 2 have bright OLED touchscreens that look great in all lighting conditions and are much more striking than the memory-in-pixel (MiP) displays used by most Garmin watches.

All versions of both watches have the same screen resolution with the exception of the compact Venu 2S as shown in this list:

Garmin Venu 2S (40mm) – 360 x 360 pixels

Garmin Venu 2 Plus (43mm) – 416 x 416 pixels

Garmin Venu 2 (45mm) – 416 x 416 pixels

Garmin Epix (47mm) – 416 x 416 pixels

The screens of both the Venu 2 and the Epix proved smooth and responsive in our tests but if you'd prefer to stick with the more traditional button navigation you can choose to disable the screen during workouts or at all times.

The Garmin Venu 2 and Epix (Gen 2) both have vivid AMOLED touchscreen displays (Image credit: Garmin)

Battery life

Shorter battery life than Fenix and Forerunner watches

The larger the watch the longer the battery life

Using always-on mode dramatically increases power usage

The downside of an OLED display is that it uses a lot more power than an MiP screen so the Venu 2 and Epix have shorter battery lives than watches in the Fenix and Forerunner series.

Their longevity is nothing to be sniffed at though particularly if you're an Apple Watch fan who's used to charging your watch every night. Generally speaking the larger the watch the larger its battery and the longer it will run between charges. We've rounded up all of Garmin's quoted battery stats here but in our tests we found that we could expect each watch to run a little longer than this.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Garmin Venu 2 Venu 2 Plus and Epix (Gen 2) maximum battery life Mode Venu 2 Venu 2 Plus Epix (Gen 2) Smartwatch 11 days 9 days 16 days Battery saver smartwatch 12 days 10 days 21 days GPS 22 hours 24 hours 42 hours Max battery GPS N/A N/A 75 hours

As with any sports watch or smartwatch the real world battery life will vary depending on the features you use such as SpO2 monitoring GPS and music playback. Enabling always-on mode will use extra power too and dramatically cut battery life (though it does make your watch look great).

There are no solar variants of either the Venu 2 or Epix but recently registered patents suggest that Garmin is working on a cost-effective way to incorporate photovoltaic cells into an OLED screen so this may be something that arrives with a future iteration of either watch.

Smartwatch and fitness features

Smartwatch features

Very similar range of smartwatch features

Epix (Gen 2) has Garmin Connect IQ store on the watch itself

Venu 2 Plus has microphone for calls and voice assistant

In terms of everyday smartwatch features the Garmin Epix (Gen 2) and Venu 2 are very similar. Both can receive smartphone notifications allow you to reject a call with a text message (if you have an Android handset) and allow you to find your phone through your watch (or vice versa). They also both let you control music playback on your phone or play music directly from the watch itself (though the Epix has much greater capacity).

Whichever watch you choose you'll be able to download additional apps through Garmin Connect IQ but if you opt for the Epix (Gen 2) then you can do it through the watch itself rather than using the mobile app on your phone.

The Venu 2 Plus has all the features of the original Venu 2 plus a microphone that allows you to take calls from your wrist and use your phone's voice assistant when it's within Bluetooth range. In our tests the sound quality was surprisingly clear for a smartwatch and we found ourselves turning to Google Assistant much more often than we would normally. This isn't something you'll get with the Epix (Gen 2).

Fitness tracking

Both excellent multi-sports watches

Epix (Gen 2) has more advanced training tools

Epix (Gen 2) has great range of maps pre-installed

When it comes to fitness tracking the Garmin Epix (Gen 2) is by far the more advanced of the pair. It has pretty much the same feature set as the Garmin Fenix 7 multi-sports watch but with the addition of that excellent OLED screen which really comes into its own for maps and navigation.

Both watches have Garmin's signature GPS (which is extremely accurate even in built-up locations) all-day heart rate monitoring stress tracking blood oxygen monitoring sleep tracking and the ability to take a 'health snapshot' to check your vital stats at a particular point during the day.

They also have an impressive raft of sports tracking modes but the Epix has a whole suite of advanced training tools on top – particularly for runners swimmers and cyclists. Training load monitoring heat and altitude acclimation a real-time stamina meter estimated finish times swim pacing alerts and open water swim metrics are just a few of the tools right at your fingertips.

The Epix (Gen 2) also comes with an excellent set of pre-loaded maps with more available through the watch's built-in map manager. In our tests we were particularly impressed by the cycling and topographical maps.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5leHRwaXQuY29tL2dhcm1pbi1lcGl4LTItcmV2aWV30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Epix 2 review: This is the watch sports fans have been waiting for!,"The Garmin Epix 2 promises to be the smartwatch Fenix fans have been waiting for years: a Fenix 7 armed with a chic AMOLED display. However the display also comes with a compromise. We tested the new Garmin Epix 2 for you.

Summary Buy Garmin Epix 2 Good Huge accessory ecosystem

Great tracking features

Great running analysis functions

Robust workmanship with optional sapphire crystal Bad Missing smartwatch features

Only one size available Garmin Epix 2 Garmin Epix 2: All deals

Design & Display The Garmin Epix 2 comes in the typical bulky Fenix design but offers the chic AMOLED display that Garmin also uses in the Venu 2 Plus. I am quite sure that Garmin fans have been waiting for this combination for a long time. What I liked: High-resolution AMOLED display.

Robust chic design. What I disliked: No smaller S version available. ""I'm a sports watch"" the Garmin Epix 2 screams with every fiber of its being. The case which measures just under 1.5 centimeters thin and 4.7 centimeters long and wide makes a statement even on wide wrists. The robust design with the (depending on the color variant) more or less color-contrasting bezel and open screws underline the robust features from the specifications sheet. The white-silver Garmin Epix 2 comes with a nice contrast between the case and the bezel. / © NextPit. In the standard variant the bezel is made of stainless steel with the case being made of polymer and steel while the display coating uses Gorilla Glass DX. The Sapphire version on the other hand relies on surprise surprise sapphire glass for the display and replaces the steel components with titanium ones. As a result the Sapphire version is not only more robust but also six grams lighter than the standard version at 70 grams. Both versions are water resistant to a depth of 100 meters and rely on 22-millimeter standard straps. There are a total of five buttons with excellent pressure points on the right and left of the case. In its 2022 flagships Garmin has lightly protected all buttons which effectively protects against accidental activation in the review. In addition to the five buttons the Epix 2 offers a touch-sensitive display which is also the biggest differentiator from the Fenix 7. Three buttons are found on the left side of the casing: Light Menu/Up and Down. / © NextPit The AMOLED panel of the Epix 2 is an old friend of whom we are familiar with: We already know of the 1.3-inch display from the Garmin Venu 2 Plus. With 65000 colors (Fenix 7: 16 colors) and 416 x 416 pixels (Fenix 7: 260 x 260 pixels) the screen is really fun to look at. I used the Epix 2 in always-on mode in the review: The default settings will have the display turned on at all times during the day. By tapping the display pressing a button or raising the arm the Epix 2 increases the brightness and displays the second hand. Also read: Garmin Venu 2 Plus review The display is almost always perfectly legible in the ""normal"" always-on mode. Only when you are in bright sunlight and looking from the side did I have to press a button to increase the brightness and tell the time. The transflective MIP display of the Fenix 7 carries a slight advantage in this aspect.

Operation and smart features The Garmin Epix 2 is first and foremost a sports watch before it is a smartwatch. Sure we will miss out on a few features especially when making a direct comparison with the current watches from Apple Samsung and others. On the other hand the features it has are simply unbeatable in the sports sector. What I liked: Operation also possible using the buttons alone.

Incredibly flexible user interface. What I disliked: Garmin Pay supports only a few banks.

Smartwatch functions can be miserly.

No LTE version available. As previously mentioned the Epix 2 has five buttons. On the right side there is a ""Start/Stop/Ok"" button at the top and a ""Back/New Lap"" button at the bottom. Garmin has placed two buttons for ""Menu/Up"" and ""Down"" in the center and at the bottom on the left and the button on the top right is used to activate the backlight and calls up the quick settings with a long press. Shortcuts for a long press can be defined for all buttons. There are two buttons on the right side of the case: Start/Stop/Ok and Back/New Lap. / © NextPit The Garmin Epix 2 can be operated completely using the buttons alone. This is very practical for example when you wear gloves or move in water. In many situations however using the touchscreen is more practical such as when one is navigating a map. With the factory settings the Epix 2 deactivates the touchscreen during workouts to avoid unwanted input. However it is much faster to enter the weight and configure the set repetition via the touchscreen during weight training. Basically the Epix 2 is incredibly flexible to configure and fortunately most settings can now also be made on the smartphone via the Garmin Connect app. It is a pity is that you cannot yet migrate settings from an old Garmin watch to a new one. You can really set almost anything you can imagine via the smartphone app. / © NextPit Whether it is through a finger swipe or touchscreen: From the watch face be it up or down you navigate through a series of widgets whose selection and arrangement is also configurable. These widgets will show you the weather forecast sunrise and sunset times compass activity level past workouts pulse or your daily shape as a ""Body Battery"" index for instance. Garmin also offers widgets for calendar entries and notifications but they are not as powerful as what we are used to from current smartwatches. The notifications for example display generic message icons for many apps and can thus be rather difficult to distinguish. Although notification texts can be read even simple replies are currently not possible. The color display is the main difference from Garmin's Fenix series. / © NextPit Unlike the Venu 2 Plus the Garmin Epix 2 also offers neither a microphone nor speakers. As such it does not allow for wrist-based phone calls nor does it support voice assistants. Unlike the Forerunner 945 there is also no LTE option for the Epix 2. At least there is NFC on board so you can pay via Garmin Pay. However none of my three banks are supported. On the plus side there is the Garmin Connect IQ Store with numerous apps and watchfaces available. You can browse through the catalog either on the watch or more conveniently on the smartphone. Usual suspects like Komoot AccuWeather or Spotify are found here. Thanks to Bluetooth you can listen to music or podcasts on the go. There is no option to reply to notifications. You can only delete them. / © NextPit

Tracking & Sensors Garmin has more tracking and sports features than you could ever use. With one activity per day you'd be busy for a good two months to work through the entire repertoire at least once. And ""cross-country skiing"" isn't just a knock-off of ""alpine skiing"" - you can find cross-country trails or slope maps including ski huts on the Epix 2's maps. Do you prefer running shoes or pedals instead of boards? Then Garmin also offers incredibly detailed options. What I liked: No other manufacturer offers more sports features.

Precise GPS tracking and accurate maps.

Very diverse accessories. What I disliked: Feature set can be overwhelming at first.

No native option for nutrition tracking. Like the Fenix 7 models the Epix 2 brings a number of new workout features over the 2021 generation. Watersports fans can look forward to kiteboarding and windsurfing options in addition to new maps for alpine skiing cross-country skiing and golf. Even Garmin's formerly paid TopoActive maps are now free on the Epix 2. Outdoor Sports & GPS Like the Fenix models the Epix 2 offers just about everything outdoor sports enthusiasts could want. Our Epix 2 review unit offers multi-band GPS as a sapphire glass option although I cannot see any significant improvement over the Venu 2 Plus here in everyday use and in my run through the forest. The positioning is almost instantaneous there are no problems with shortcuts and the watch tracks trails that have been run multiple times practically congruently. There are also a number of interesting GPS features: For example you can save specific coordinates or record routes or navigate through recorded routes or routes from third-party sources like Komoot after starting any GPS sport as a workout. The Garmin Epix 2 brings extensive and detailed maps - offline navigation included. / © NextPit The extensive accessory set is especially exciting for outdoor athletes: For cyclists there are cadence sensors that measure the cadence on the bike. For triathletes or runners Garmin offers various heart rate belts. These are then for example waterproof or offer advanced running analysis functions and record for example the vertical movement and ground contact time during running so that you can optimize your running style. Garmin HRM Dual heart rate belt Garmin Temperature Sensor Garmin speed sensor Garmin cadence sensor During your workouts Garmin shows you detailed information such as heart rate zones current pace etc. You can now also customize the way data is viewed on your smartphone. I find the Stamina display to be particularly exciting. Here the Epix 2 tries to estimate how many kilometers you can still run or how much time you have left at the current pace. The idea behind this? You can estimate during your runs on distance or time whether you will run out of energy before the finish line at the current speed or still have additional energy to spare at the end. The Epix 2 shows you detailed statistics on your runs especially if you're using a chest strap like the HRM Tri which supports Running Dynamics. / © NextPit Of course like all data from fitness trackers and the like these are only estimates that should not be trusted blindly. But with a little experience such values can definitely be helpful. Finally Garmin offers comprehensive training plans with different goals for running fans which follow the training philosophies of various running gurus. The plans are really well prepared. Indoor sports & fitness Even though outdoor sports are the great heritage of Garmin's sports watches the Epix 2 also offers numerous features for indoor fitness applications. During HIIT or strength training for example the smartwatch not only tracks your heart rate but also the exercises you perform including the number of repetitions. You can then obtain an evaluation on which muscle groups were used and to what extent. Garmin also offers predefined workouts such as HIIT training and you can create your own workouts via the app. For the future I would still like to see a load status including recovery time not only for the entire body but also for individual muscle groups. This would make it possible to better estimate the training intensity for the next strength training session. During strength training the Garmin Epix 2 determines what exercises you have performed and how much stress your body received. / © NextPit Whether for outdoor or indoor sports: the Elevate Gen4 heart rate sensor from Garmin offers a very decent heart rate measurement and hopefully also in the long term thanks to the new glass coating. For sports with little strain on the wrists the results are very precise and largely congruent with the results from a chest strap system. For sports that involve the wrists having a tight fit of the watch on the wrist is important. But even then the readings somewhat diverge compared to those of a chest strap system especially when one has a high heart rate. During a shoulder-arm workout for example the Garmin Epix 2 came up with a maximum pulse of 150 and an average pulse of 115. With a Sigma chest strap the average pulse of 117 was only slightly higher but the maximum pulse measured here deviated significantly to 165. The numerous widgets are practical for everyday use. For example you can see the weather forecast sunset alert and compass. A tap of the finger shows further details. / © NextPit Sleep & Recovery Last but not least the Epix 2 offers a lot of features to evaluate your general fitness. The most prominent feature is the Body Battery which is your body's 'battery' or energy levels. Workouts and stressful days drain the battery and sleep fills it up again. Garmin wants to give you a measure of how hard you can work out. Health Snapshot is a snapshot of your health (left). The training load tells you which aspects of your fitness you should train more (center and right). For me the high-anaerobic area is sorely missing so it is time to unpack my running shoes! / © NextPit Another feature to evaluate your fitness is ""Health Snapshot"". Here you get a daily update of your fitness in a two-minute measurement based on pulse heart rate variability oxygen saturation (SpO2) respiration rate and stress. If you want to compare the values with each other you should always perform this ""screenshot of your health"" at the same time of day. In addition the Epix 2 will also determine your VO2Max value. The training load over time is also interesting. Here you can see what kind of training stimuli you are using to stimulate your body: Anaerobic High Aerobic and Low Aerobic? The bottom line is that I found out: I should do less strength training and more endurance training. The Garmin app offers detailed statistics on your sleep / © NextPit Last but not least the Garmin Epix 2 records your sleep. This works reliably in terms of your sleeping and waking times. Unfortunately I cannot check the determined distribution of the different sleep phases due to the lack of a sleep lab. However I can confirm a correlation between puffy eyes in the morning and poor sleep assessment by the Epix 2 such as retiring for the night way too late after a sumptuous dinner.

Garmin Epix 2 battery In contrast to its sister model Fenix 7 the Epix 2 offers significantly less battery life although ""significantly less"" is still a lot. With an always-on display active sensor battery and one hour of exercise per day the sports smartwatch still manages almost a week of activity before requiring a trip to the power outlet. What I liked: Great battery life. What I disliked: No wireless charging supported. The AMOLED display of the Epix 2 does take up a significant chunk of the battery life. While the Fenix 7 (without solar) lasts 18 days in smartwatch mode according to the manufacturer it is ""only"" six days for the Epix 2 according to Garmin. In the review we normally achieved five to six days of battery runtime on five out of seven days with fully activated sensors always-on display and activity tracking. That is excellent value compared to most of the other smartwatches out there. The Epix 2 can be charged via the same four-pin connector as many current Garmin watches in the mid- to high-end price segment. / © NextPit Unfortunately we were not able to test the various power-saving features in detail during the review period. Garmin promises 16 days of battery life with the always-on display deactivated and even 21 days in power-saving mode. In maximum operation during a workout with GPS tracking multi-band GPS and music playback the Epix 2 is supposed to last 9 hours which is probably enough for most ultramarathoners out there. When it comes to charging Garmin relies on its well-known proprietary four-pin charging cable which has also been used by the Venu Forerunner or Fenix models for years. Unfortunately Garmin still does not support wireless charging in 2022.

GPS technology is a grand achievement of human ingenuity that we can’t imagine existing without now and it has improved our and our dogs’ lives tremendously. With dog GPS trackers we can know exactly where our dog is located in the field or in the event they choose to leave the yard. When it comes to the best dog GPS trackers there are plenty of choices for dog owners. And with a healthy competition in a hot market that addresses the diverse needs of dog owners it might seem intimidating if you’re jumping into this market for the first time.

I tested five of the best dog GPS trackers with the help of my Brittany and trusted expert dog handlers to see how they perform in the field. The goal of my review is to provide you with the information that helps you find the best GPS collar for you. After all considering the plethora of GPS trackers available it’s best to paint with broad strokes and cover the Ford vs. Chevy brand choices. As with vehicle choice two things are true: 1) brand loyalty among users is huge (more on this below) and 2) the latest options from each brand do a great job with core functions. It basically comes down to personal preference and which features best fit your needs.

How to Choose a Dog GPS Tracker

The GPS tracker you choose will depend on your budget desired features and your hunting style. Dog GPS trackers range from basic trackers that work with an app to units with a several mile range and a long list of functions. If you’re a dog owner that has an escape artist for a pet a simple unit like the Fi Series 2 will help you locate a lost dog. But the Fi isn’t the a good option for hunters who need to track their dogs and give commands through the collar.



It’s important to note that my take on these units is necessarily slanted by my position as a pointing dog owner who uses one dog to hunt birds often with friends and their dogs. While the list above is a good starting point for anyone considering the best dog GPS trackers I encourage deeper research to determine the best fit for your specific needs.

Pay attention to what your hunting buddies use or who you’re running dogs with. For instance most of the bird dog folks I hunt with use Garmin devices. I’ve learned as much from my hunting buddies about the devices I own before and after purchase as I’ve learned from any other source. Using the same brand of equipment they do allows us to work together and track each other and our dogs.

Many distributors offer great online video reviews and other helpful information. My go-to is always Gun Dog Supply and owner Steve Snell’s video reviews. I always work through the information they provide before making a purchase but there are plenty of other distributors and independent reviewers who offer similar insights on their sites. For independent reviewers find someone who represents your situation best (ie. if you are a bear hunter using hounds or a bird dog owner hunting in the mountains find a reviewer who is the same).

Best Overall: Garmin Alpha 200i

Key Features

External top and side buttons

9-mile range when paired with Garmin’s latest TT15x collars

Tracks up to 20 dogs/collars

Cell service not needed

All maps come pre-loaded

Integrated inReach capability

Why It Made the Cut

Garmin’s latest full-featured offering for hunting dogs the Alpha 200i is the true Swiss Army knife of track and train collar systems.

Pros

Does almost anything you need from a track and train system

Highly customizable

Easy-to-use buttons

More accessible for tracking hunting partners and/or their dogs

Cons

Pricey

Maps and screen clarity lacks compared to smartphone options

Complex set up and navigation

Lacks integration options with non-Garmin products

Product Description

For those already sold on Garmin products who need an all-in-one track and train option the Alpha 200i beats the masses. It’s compatible with Garmin TT 15X collars which have up to an 8 hour battery life and 9 mile range. Garmin improved the features that won fans in the Alpha 100 and addressed the most commonly cited weaknesses of that unit the in-field e-collar/training functions. The previous unit’s reliance on its touchscreen to change stimulation levels was a turn-off for many of us. But I like the Alpha 200i’s more efficient activation of stimulation that I think better serves hunting dog owners who use it to communicate with their dogs in situation-appropriate ways. That’s a game changer for pointing dog owners whose training systems depend on silent command (e-collar) communication.

The Alpha 200i is the true Swiss Army knife of track and train collar systems. Robb Moore

To increase the comprehensive nature of the 200i Garmin added inReach capability to the Alpha 200i (though you can opt out and save money with the Alpha 200 if you don’t need inReach) so the unit can function as a satellite communicator and emergency SOS device with a Garmin subscription service. I did find that these features require a complex set-up and steep learning curve. If you need full-featured mapping capabilities and want your unit to do everything the Alpha 200i is tough to beat.

Best Budget: Fi Series 2

Key Features

GPS technology for collar location and cellular service communication with smartphone app

Unobtrusive collar unit

Good selection of collars and styles from the manufacturers and third party vendors

Why It Made the Cut

The Fi Series 2 offers a reasonable entry-level option for those who don’t need the more robust and expensive options available for hunting dogs.

Pros

Intuitive easy-to-use app

Inexpensive

Good activity tracking

Cons

Not as accurate as more expensive options

Requires subscription service (around $100 per year) to use tracking features

Product Description

There are more and more GPS tracker brands out there and many of them won’t be around in a few years. You don’t want to invest in a unit only for the manufacturer to go belly up and with it goes all the support. Fi is a safe bet though and their relatively strong market share means you don’t have to worry about them disappearing overnight.

The app allows you to track your dog’s path. Robb Moore The Fi Series 2 is an excellent option for dog owners that need an emergency dog tracker. Robb Moore

The collar has a great battery life compared to others I’ve used and when you use it with Wifi battery life is greatly extended. I found the promise of up to three weeks of battery life to be conservative. Even with active use away from the base station we made it a bit past three weeks before I had to charge the collar again. Putting the unit in “lost dog” mode will activate the collar’s light for better visibility and greatly increases the accuracy of the tracking but also greatly reduces battery life. Fi only promises up to two days of battery life in this mode assuming a start with a full charge. Still considering the need to quickly locate a lost dog this is a great feature for peace of mind as is the geo-fencing escape detection that provides alerts when a dog is separated from an owner’s smartphone and/or is outside of the range of the home. While I find the features less compelling in terms of my needs other users may also enjoy the fitness sleep tracking and social media features the app provides.

It’s important to realize that the Fi lost dog mode should be used for emergencies only and you can’t rely on it to be 100 percent reliable. Without good cell service the tracking features of this collar are useless and you’d need more robust options available for hunting dogs in areas where there’s no cell reception. Still this unit has its place and if you need a GPS tracker that will do in a pinch the Fi is a good option at its price point.

Best for International Hunting: SportDOG TEK 2.0

Key Features

Intuitive map view directional arrows and real-time tracking display

Upgradable to training functions with ecollar plate

Rolling dial for handheld functions and ecollar stimulation (once upgraded for training functions)

Voice updates

10-mile range for direct collar-to-handheld communication

Tracks up to 21 dogs/collars

Why It Made the Cut

SportDOG’s Tek 2.0 is the best for compatibility with international GPS technology and laws. It also offers great tracking-only services without e-collar functionality but you can easily upgrade to training functions without purchasing a separate unit.

Pros

GPS technology is more compatible internationally

Cell service not needed

Pre-loaded maps

Cons

Not as popular or pairable as competitors

Latest product not as recent as competitors

Product Description

For those who need the more robust and dependable GPS tracking functionality of a hunting dog collar but aren’t sure they need ecollar/training functionality the SportDOG Tek 2.0 is a great option. You can easily add the ecollar prong plate to the GPS-only collar to make the upgrade later if you change your mind. For those who need training features and want to use the same collar during field trials (which generally forbid ecollar use) this is an attractive option from the manufacturer that was the first to offer a track and train combo system.

While I haven’t personally used this unit my favorite Canadian bird dog expert Craig Koshyk does. I talked to him about his experiences to get input from his many hours of use. He was quick to point out he only uses the SportDOG TEK for its tracking features. On that front he has found that it meets all of his needs and is easy to use. He has had to replace the batteries after a couple of years but they were easy to find and replace. And for anyone who might be hunting in Canada the TEK 2.0 is hands down the best option in terms of compatibility.

When upgraded to ecollar use the SportDOG Tek 2.0’s distinctive smooth dial can more precisely adjust stimulation levels (1-99 levels). The SportDOG Tek 2.0 moving arrows indicate the current direction of a dog in motion which is an attractive feature. And the SportDOG system can be used in Canada if you have Canadian birds on your hunting bucket list. Outside of the United States and Canada the SportDOG system also offers the least legal and technical limitations internationally.

SportDOG’s main drawback is its smaller share of the market. For those wishing to take advantage of tracking their hunting partners’ handhelds or dogs the SportDOG comes up short compared to its competitors. But if you plant to hunt outside the country the Tek 2.0 is hard to beat.

Best with Google Maps: Dogtra Pathfinder SE

Key Features

Integrated smartphone use with Google Maps

Compatible with Dogtra GPS or GPS and ecollar combo collars

9-mile range for direct collar to transmitter/phone communication

Tracks up to 21 dogs/collars

Cell service not needed

Why It Made the Cut

The Dogtra Pathfinder SE is the only full featured track and train collar system that relies almost entirely on a smartphone for handheld mapping and training features.

Pros

Reasonable price

Utilizes Google maps

Integration with non-Dogtra tech like AppleWatch

Cons

Smartphone use isn’t convenient for training features

Must use separate transmitter

Product Description

The Dogtra Pathfinder SE track and train system pairs your smartphone with an external transmitter to track your dog. For those with a pre-existing compatible smartphone this is the most economical choice because you only pay for the transmitter that links your smartphone and app to the dog collar.

A good friend of mine Jonathan Eastwood uses this unit and its mapping detail is what most stands out for him. “The mapping detail is fabulous and is most useful for reviewing terrain that you may have missed. I love the status information it provides on point bark running and the stats it provides for distance covered and time spent hunting. It’s well built intuitive super fast and responsive and functions well in every category for which it was designed” Eastwood said. As a pointing dog owner however he finds the reliance on the smartphone screen for accessing training features to be a disadvantage. “If I were running any kind of hound or chase dog the Pathfinder would be the ultimate for me” he said.

The Pathfinder is an app based tracker. Robb Moore

If you’re the type of hunter who wants to leave your smartphone in the truck while you hunt this might not be an appealing option for you. And Eastwood suggests yet another consideration “The Pathfinder eats phone batteries for lunch in the same way any GPS enabled app does. So I have to carry a backup battery accessory if my hunt might last more than four hours or if my phone wasn’t fully charged when I started” he said. But for those who don’t mind using their smartphone and prefer the intuitive Google Maps the Pathfinder SE is probably the best current option for mapping multiple dogs.

Best Simplified: Garmin PRO 550 Plus

Key Features

Has most commonly used tracking GPS and training features

9-mile range when paired with Garmin’s latest TT15x

Tracks up to three dogs/collars

Does not utilize cell service

Why It Made the Cut

It’s been three years since Garmin introduced this unit and it’s still the best option on the market for 95 percent of what many pointing dog owners need from a dog GPS tracker.

Pros

Intuitive tracking/GPS and training

Physical buttons for training features

Garmin means increased opportunity to pair with hunting partners

Cons

Mapping features must be added with app

Only tracks three dogs at a time

Product Description

If I could only choose one dog GPS tracker I’d pick the Garmin PRO 550 Plus every time. While I own the Alpha 100 and other ecollar/training-only systems I bring them with me on hunts 9 times out of 10 only as backups in case my PRO 550 Plus miraculously falters. The tracking capabilities are admittedly basic but they give pointing dog owners most of what they need from any in-field tracker like distance and direction of the dog and whether it’s on point or treed. This handheld doesn’t offer maps and won’t track other Garmin hunting partners or mark your truck. It only tracks 1-3 dogs and displays them one at a time and you can cycle between them with a simple toggle switch. Paired with the Garmin Explore app on your smartphone it offers some mapping features but nothing as compelling as the Alpha 200i or even the Alpha 10.

The Garmin 550 Pro Plus shines as an ecollar/training unit. Robb Moore

In addition to giving me the things I most need out of a tracker this handheld really shines as an ecollar/training unit. It provides a system that I can use instinctively to give my dog situation-appropriate stimulation like silent commands or on rare occasions diverting him from danger and/or using higher levels of stimulation to break him from chasing anything he shouldn’t. While the design of the handheld isn’t perfect for e-collar/training functions (I sometimes accidentally switch the toggles between collars and between momentary and continuous stimulation) it’s pretty damn close.

FAQs

Q: What is the best GPS tracker for dogs? Because it offers so many tracking and mapping features the Garmin Alpha 200i is the best GPS tracker for dogs. Not only is this unit reliable there’s a good chance that others at camp probably have Garmin products as well so linking up with them will be a breeze. Q: Are GPS dog trackers worth it? If you’re a serious dog hunter GPS dog trackers are worth the investment. As I stated earlier GPS trackers don’t mean that your dog can’t get lost but if it’s well-trained there’s a lot less chance of that happening. Even if you just want peace of mind for your non-hunting dog a budget GPS tracker like the Fi Series 2 is a good option. Q: Can I track my dog with my phone? As long as your dog GPS tracker has smartphone capabilities like the Dogtra Pathfinder SE then you can use your phone to track your dog.

Final Thoughts

A tracking collar is not a guarantee a dog will not get lost. They should be thought of as a risk-reduction rather than a risk elimination strategy and that’s especially true when considering lower budget options. Also if your dog isn’t trained to obey your calls a GPS tracker won’t change this though it certainly won’t hurt anything. While you get what you pay for like all technology even the best dog GPS trackers will malfunction. Think about everything that can go wrong with your car GPS and you’ll have a good idea what can go wrong with any tracking dog collar.



While the homo sapien/canis familiaris close relationship goes back tens of thousands of years it’s tough to imagine a time without GPS tracking technology. Can you like your ancestors make do just fine without it? I suppose. Are you likely to want to after experiencing the technology’s benefits and the additional peace of mind these devices give? Highly doubtful. From serving as another enhancement to our dogs’ safety to increasing our effectiveness as hunters there’s really no substitute for GPS tracking technology. Do your research pick one of the best dog GPS trackers that suits you and start enjoying all the benefits they offer for you and your dog’s outdoor adventures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15aGVhbHRoeWFwcGxlLmNvbS9nYXJtaW4taW1wcm92ZWQtc2xlZXAtdHJhY2tpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin hopes to help keep better track of your sleeping habits,"Other than exercising and eating healthy getting enough sleep is one of the most important factors in your life.

That’s why more and more fitness trackers are including sleep tracking functions. Garmin is the latest to add new features to its smartwatches and trackers.

Advanced Sleep Monitoring (ASM)

Garmin’s Advanced Sleep Monitoring (ASM) feature is available on newer model Garmin watches and trackers that include Garmin’s optical heart rate sensor.

ASM allows user to track their sleep statistics in the companion Garmin Connect app after wearing the device while sleeping.

Some Garmin devices also include PulseOx (oxygen saturation) and respiration metrics in their sleep analytics.

Pulse Ox Pulse Oximetry (Pulse Ox) is a non-invasive method used to measure the saturation of oxygen in the bloodstream

Respiration This feature displays how many breaths you take per minute



Not all Garmin devices include these features–so check your device’s user manual. As of this writing the Fenix 6 & 5 Vivoactive 4 Vivosmart 4 and Forerunner 245/645/945 all include PulseOx.

Heart Rate Variability

Sleep monitoring depends on tracking heart rate variability (HRV). Heart Rate Variability is the time measured between each heartbeat. Tracking HRV improves the sleep feature’s accuracy.

Using data from HRV along with information from the accelerometer helps Garmin determine when you fall asleep when you wake up and what level of sleep you are in.

By including the optical heart rate sensor’s data along with three sleep variables–light sleep deep sleep and REM sleep Garmin hopes to provide you with a detailed snapshot of how you sleep.

Light Sleep: Eye movements and muscle activity slow down to prepare for deep sleep

Eye movements and muscle activity slow down to prepare for deep sleep Deep Sleep (restoration mode): Eye and muscle movements stop completely. Heart rate and breathing slow down. The body recovers building bone and muscle and boosts your immune system

Eye and muscle movements stop completely. Heart rate and breathing slow down. The body recovers building bone and muscle and boosts your immune system REM Sleep (dream stage): Brain activity shows almost the same activity level as when awake. REM sleep is critical in memory retention and information processing

When viewing the data in the Garmin Connect app you see stats for light and deep sleep and REM sleep and your Awake Time. If your Garmin supports Pulse Ox you also see the timeframe where your device captured your oxygen saturation data while sleeping.

Additionally Garmin added a few new algorithms that hopefully improve accuracy even further allowing you to understand what’s going on when you’re sleeping.

To learn if your Garmin device supports sleep tracking and advanced sleep monitoring see this compatibility list.

Garmin and the future

All of this is coming following a partnership with the University of Kansas Medical Center. The company announced its partnership with a primary focus on sleep apnea.

The two have been working on a series of other projects. Showing everyone how committed to improving health and fitness with the help of wearables.

Garmin is also working to catch up with Fitbit who has been leading the way in the “sleep space”. Fitbit’s trackers are well-documented to provide some of the best stats.

Meanwhile Garmin has been stepping up its game and this latest update is another example. Hopefully the continued updates will not only improve Garmin. But instead will also push Fitbit and others to improve their various quality of life features.

It will be interesting to see what updates come in the future for Garmin’s wearables. The company is continuing to push the boundaries in some facets but it’s nice to see them play catchup here.

Let us know if you have received the update on your Garmin wearable. Also let us know how well the update works for you now.",,,

Data4’s Olivier de Nomazy examines the driving forces that will shape the future of the data center

Growth digitisation and efficiency are the three primary objectives of organisations around the world according to Gartner. ‘Cloudification’ accelerated by the pandemic and promoted in particular by European governments’ aims to accelerate the digital transition helps address these challenges.

Cloud computing gives businesses the freedom to work innovate and collaborate anywhere at any time through agile secure platforms on clouds of their choice (public private and hybrid). By 2025 cloud-native platforms will host more than 95 percent of new digital initiatives – up 40 percent on 2021 according to Gartner forecasts. Organizations are currently turning to multi-cloud and hybrid cloud leading to other innovations such as containers and micro-services to improve workload portability in the cloud. New models such as DCIaaS (Dedicated Cloud Infrastructure as a Service) are also being developed. According to IDC this sector will be growing at more than 150 percent per year by 2025 making it possible to enjoy all the benefits of public cloud both on-premises and in a colocation environment. In parallel with a brand new French law intended to reduce the environmental footprint of digital technology the objective of which is to reconcile digital with ecological principles all these parameters combine to build the profile of new more environmentally friendly secure and flexible data centers well-suited to the post-Covid world.

‘Zero trust’ architectures will be increasingly adopted preventing any user or device from connecting to the network without permission

1) Post-covid data centers will be more flexible and on the edge Regional data centers have continued their rapid growth further legitimised by the health context and the crucial advantages of a more widely distributed IT infrastructure. This trend will accelerate in the coming years to support our post-Covid digital economy (encompassing teleworking video streaming development of e-commerce IoT 5G and so on). While availability remains the utmost priority these Edge data centers are also more agile and energy-efficient while providing lower latency. Their ultra-modular design gives them an edge in terms of energy performance. In addition deployed in a distributed mode more and more of them will guarantee high availability by means of distributed resilience mechanisms. Their design is lighter (built to Uptime Institute Tier 2 standards) and they will be able to shift workloads according to the origin of the energy consumed thus providing businesses with quick backup solutions while reducing their environmental impact.

The concept of ‘digital twin’ will help avoid potential errors prior to physical construction

2) Will ensure better protection against attacks According to estimates the volume of data generated worldwide will exceed 180 zettabytes by 2025. That amounts to an average annual growth rate of nearly 40 percent over five years1. This staggering mass of data could be an invaluable source of critical information for an organization helping with their strategic decision-making. While the data center is the ‘digital safe’ of this new gold rush security issues still need to be addressed via tighter controls in terms of logical as well as physical security such as building access-control using drones and increasingly advanced facial recognition to improve overall security. In addition ‘zero trust’ architectures will be increasingly adopted preventing any user or device from connecting to the network without permission. For this model to work organizations must micro-segment all their resources enforce strict access controls but also inspect and record all network traffic by taking into account terminals workloads and data.

The data center industry is keen to ramp up the development and adoption of sustainable practices in order to limit the industry’s impact on climate change

Furthermore to reinforce the security of data outsourced to these infrastructures the majority of businesses will opt for multi-cloud architectures such as those of Azure or Amazon. Businesses will soon rely on advanced encryption technologies such as homomorphic encryption which applies a mathematical calculation system to data without having to decrypt it. 3) Will respond to the challenges of high density Fierce competition between Intel and AMD to deliver ever-better CPUs has given data centers a welcome boost in terms of innovation and power to meet intensive computational needs in particular those required by AI. However this high density raises a major issue: by hosting increasingly dense infrastructures in a restricted space data centers are faced with the challenge of efficiently dissipating the heat produced. This is why in the coming years we should witness the gradual combined deployment of traditional cooling on low-density racks alongside liquid cooling on high-density racks. 4) Will make greater use of digital tools The Covid-19 pandemic combined with the flow of innovations based on software automation and artificial intelligence increased the need to ramp up the development of data centers while making their operations less dependent on humans. The adoption of increasingly streamlined construction models such as building information modelling (BIM) will help speed up the steps and customise design in keeping with demand while factoring in security.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2VyYXZleW91LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0L3plZGQtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWZ1bGwtbGluZS11cC1mb3ItdGhlLXJldHVybi1vZi16ZWRkLWluLXRoZS1wYXJrLXRoaXMtanVseS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zedd announces full line-up for the return of Zedd In The Park this July,"After a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic Zedd is at long last bringing his very own festival ‘Zedd In The Park’ back to the Los Angeles State Historic Park on Friday July 8.

Officers also took nearly 400 grams of methamphetamine and almost $11000 in Logan’s arrest.

“After receiving information about Logan’s involvement in drug sales in Asheville including tips from the Tip411 app our officers were able to use that information to make the arrest” said Asheville Police Department Chief David Zack. “This is a significant drug arrest which removes a large amount of this deadly drug from our streets much in thanks to the support we receive from the community sharing your tips.”

In addition to the drugs and cash seized APD officers also recovered a brick press vacuum sealer and blender.

The police department said one kilogram of fentanyl potentially could kill 500000 people according to the DEA and Thursday’s drug bust produced 1.25 kilograms of the suspected drug.

Logan faces several charges in the arrest that include possession with intent to sell or deliver fentanyl and methamphetamine and tracking in opium or heroin by possession.

The 33-year-old was booked into the Buncombe County Detention Center on a $500000 bond.

The starting five got their nickname of the “Iron Five” due to the short rotation the team has and how many minutes per game the starters actually play. I expect that to stay the same against Duke with a short rotation of maybe 2 guys off the bench.

If that video didn’t give you chills for Saturday night I don’t know what will.

A one-stop partner for the enterprise’s clinical AI needs Aidoc’s other seven FDA-cleared solutions are already implemented across U.S. health systems flagging and communicating suspected pathologies in CT exams – and now have expanded to the high volume X-ray modality.

Aidoc’s newly FDA-cleared solution runs on all X-ray machines including portable ones and is designed to analyze X-ray images. It automatically flags positive cases of pneumothorax facilitating physicians to read X-rays in a timely manner.

The ability to quickly identify pneumothorax is imperative as it can worsen rapidly and result in respiratory or cardiac failure. This however is easier said than done due to the extensive imaging volumes radiologists have to continuously examine. Aidoc’s highly accurate AI pneumothorax algorithm addresses this challenge by analyzing X-rays flagging and notifying physicians of the suspected findings.

“We’re very excited about this important milestone” said Elad Walach CEO of Aidoc. “This FDA clearance further validates the breadth of our AI platform going beyond specific AI algorithms to act as a healthcare AI hub for the enterprise’s cross-specialty needs. This includes ER ICU outpatient centers inpatient admissions and the coordination of care and communication among providers. By bringing radiologists and proceduralists to the same AI platform we enable enhanced collaboration across departments and systems to deliver patients with the right treatment at the right time.”

Aidoc’s AI platform processes high volumes of scans and images without disrupting the physician’s workflow. Existing partners of Aidoc who add the pneumothorax solution to their portfolio will not require any additional integration infrastructure or maintenance efforts.

If you own one of Amazon’s smart displays you can turn it into one of the best digital photo frames for displaying images that are personal to you and your home.

This is different from knowing how to change the background picture on your Echo Show. You can upload a static image to your smart display at any time in the device’s settings in the Alexa app. But to create a rotating collection of personalized photos that perhaps blends in your home’s decor you’ll need to take a few extra steps.

No fear it’s not difficult. In fact I demonstrated how I turned my Amazon Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen) into a digital photo frame in my bedroom for a video on Tom’s Guide’s TikTok account. (P.S. if you follow Tom’s Guide on TikTok you’ll see more awesome tech hacks.)

As some of the best smart displays and best smart speakers Echo Show devices are popular fixtures in the kitchen or bedroom. While it can be informative to stick with the default rotation of news sports scores and suggestions for the best Alexa skills turning your Echo Show into a digital photo frame can elevate the user experience.

In order to turn an Echo Show into a digital photo frame you’ll need to set up Amazon Photos which is one of the best photo storage sites. Amazon Photos is an unlimited photo storage option for Amazon Prime members. Amazon Prime recently raised its price from $119 to $139 per year though there are secret deals every Prime member needs to know.

Before getting started turning your digital photo frame download the Amazon Photos app now ( iOS  Android ) and sign into your Amazon account if it's not set up already. And now I’ll show you how to turn an Echo Show into a digital photo frame from the Alexa app.

Imagine with me for a moment standing on a mountain in Galilee witnessing the wonder and glory of the resurrected Savior visiting His disciples. How awe-inspiring to consider personally hearing these words which He shared with them His solemn charge to “go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.”1 Surely these words would empower inspire and move each of us as they did His Apostles. Indeed they devoted the rest of their lives to doing just that.

Interestingly it wasn’t only the Apostles who took Jesus’s words to heart. Members of the early Church from the newest to the most seasoned took part in the Savior’s great commission sharing the good news of the gospel with those they met and knew. The determination to share their testimony of Jesus Christ helped His newly established Church grow expansively.2

We too as Christ’s disciples are invited to heed His commission today as if we were there on that mountain in Galilee when He first proclaimed it. This commission began again in 1830 when Joseph Smith set apart his brother Samuel as an early missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ.3 Since that time more than 1.5 million missionaries have traveled throughout the world teaching all nations and baptizing those who embrace the glad tidings of the restored gospel.

This is our doctrine. Our fond desire.

From our young children to the eldest among us we yearn for the time when we can heed the Savior’s call and share the gospel with the nations of the world. I am sure you young men and young women felt a similar empowering challenge from our prophet yesterday as he invited you to prepare for full-time missionary service just as the Savior did with His Apostles.

Like sprinters at the starting blocks we wait with anticipation for the official invitation complete with the prophet’s signature signaling the start of the race! This desire is noble and inspirational; however let’s consider this question: why don’t we all begin now?

You might ask “How can I be a missionary without a name badge?” Or we tell ourselves “The full-time missionaries are set apart to do this work. I would like to help but perhaps later when life has calmed down a bit.”

Brothers and sisters it is much simpler than that! Gratefully the Savior’s great commission can be accomplished through simple easily understandable principles taught to each of us from childhood: love share and invite.

Love The first thing we can do is love as Christ loved. Our hearts are heavy with the human suffering and tensions that we see throughout the world during these tumultuous times. However we can be also inspired by the outpouring of compassion and humanitarianism that has been demonstrated by people everywhere through their efforts to reach out to the marginalized—those displaced from their homes separated from their families or experiencing other forms of sorrow and despair. Recently news sources reported how a group of mothers in Poland out of concern for desperate fleeing families left fully equipped strollers on a train station platform in a neat line ready and waiting for refugee mothers and children who would need them at that border crossing as they deboarded a train. Surely our Heavenly Father smiles upon acts of selfless charity such as these for as we bear one another’s burdens we “fulfil the law of Christ.”4 Whenever we show Christlike love toward our neighbor we preach the gospel—even if we do not voice a single word. Love for others is the eloquent expression of the second great commandment to love our neighbor;5 it shows the refining process of the Holy Spirit working within our own souls. By demonstrating Christ’s love to others we may cause those who see our good works to “glorify [our] Father which is in heaven.”6 We do this expecting nothing in return. Our hope of course is they will accept our love and our message though how they react is not within our control. What we do and who we are certainly are. Through Christlike love for others we preach the glorious life-transforming properties of Christ’s gospel and we participate significantly in the fulfilling of His great commission.

Share The second thing we can do is share. During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic Brother Wisan from Thailand felt prompted to share his feelings and impressions of what he was learning in his study of the Book of Mormon on his social media account. In one of his particularly personal posts he shared a story of two Book of Mormon missionaries Alma and Amulek. His brother Winai although set in his religious beliefs was touched by the post and responded unexpectedly asking “Can I get that book in Thai?” Wisan wisely arranged for a copy of the Book of Mormon to be delivered by two sister missionaries who began teaching his brother. Wisan joined in virtual lessons during which he shared his feelings about the Book of Mormon. Winai learned to pray and study with a truth-seeking spirit to accept and embrace the truth. Within months Winai was baptized! Wisan later said “We have a responsibility to be an instrument in the hands of God and we must be always ready for Him to do His work in His way through us.” Their family miracle came because Wisan simply shared the gospel in a normal and natural way. We all share things with others. We do it often. We share what movies and food we like funny things we see places we visit art we appreciate quotes we’re inspired by. How might we simply add to the list of things we already share what we love about the gospel of Jesus Christ? Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf explained: “If someone asks about your weekend don’t hesitate to talk about what you experienced at church. Tell about the little children who stood in front of a congregation and sang with eagerness how they are trying to be like Jesus. Talk about the group of youth who spent time helping the elderly in rest homes to compile personal histories.”7 Sharing isn’t about “selling” the gospel. You don’t have to write a sermon or correct someone’s incorrect perceptions. When it comes to missionary work God doesn’t need you to be His sheriff; He does however ask that you be His sharer. By sharing our positive experiences in the gospel with others we take part in fulfilling the Savior’s great commission.

Invite The third thing you can do is invite. Sister Mayra is a recent convert from Ecuador. Her joy in the gospel skyrocketed immediately following her baptism as she invited friends and loved ones around her through social media accounts. Many family members and friends who saw her posts responded with questions. Mayra connected with them often inviting them to her home to meet with the missionaries together. Mayra’s parents her siblings her aunt two cousins and several of her friends were baptized because she courageously invited them to “come and see” “come and serve” and “come and belong.” Through her normal and natural invitations over 20 people have accepted her invitation to be baptized members of the Church of Jesus Christ. This came about because Sister Mayra simply invited others to experience the joy she felt as a member of the Church. Image Sister Mayra and those she has invited to experience gospel joy There are hundreds of invitations we can extend to others. We can invite others to “come and see” a sacrament service a ward activity an online video that explains the gospel of Jesus Christ. “Come and see” can be an invitation to read the Book of Mormon or visit a new temple during its open house prior to its dedication. Sometimes the invitation is something we extend inward—an invitation to ourselves giving us awareness and vision of opportunities surrounding us to act upon. In our digital age members often share messages through social media. There are hundreds if not thousands of uplifting things you might find worthy of sharing. This content offers invitations to “come and see” “come and serve” and “come and belong.” As we invite others to learn more about the gospel of Jesus Christ we take part in the Savior’s call to engage in the work of His commission.",,,,,,

Like other Western countries the United States has turned to its own stocks to furnish Ukraine with shoulder-fired Stinger and Javelin missiles for instance. These weapons from Lockheed-Martin and Raytheon Technologies were paid for some time ago.

So these companies' first quarter results due to be released in coming weeks should not be especially fatter because of the rush to arm Ukraine as it fights off the Russian invasion.

But those US military weapons stockpiles being tapped for Kyiv will need to be replenished.

The Pentagon plans to use $3.5 billion earmarked for this purpose in a spending bill approved in mid-March a Defense Department spokesman told AFP.

The Javelin anti-tank missile is made by a joint venture between Lockheed and Raytheon. The latter's Stinger anti-aircraft missile had ceased to be produced until the Pentagon ordered $340 million of them last summer.

""We are exploring options to more quickly replenish US inventories and backfill depleted stocks of allies and partners"" the spokesman said.

""It will take time to revive the industrial base -- at the prime and at sub-tier suppliers -- to enable production to resume"" he added.

The profits that the companies make from these missiles known for being simple to use will not exactly be staggering defense industry experts told AFP.

""If 1000 Stingers and 1000 Javelins get shipped to Eastern Europe each month for the next year which is not unlikely given the current pace in our view we think it would equate to $1 billion to $2 billion in revenue for both program manufacturers which is material"" said Colin Scarola of CFRA an investment research firm.

Raytheon's and Lockheed's revenue figures last year dwarf that amount however: $64 billion and $67 billion respectively.

""Raytheon probably made more money off selling a Patriot missile system to Saudi Arabia than they will from making Stinger missiles"" said Jordan Cohen an arms sales specialist at the Cato Institute.

""They're only going to put so much effort into producing those weapons that are not that valuable"" Cohen told AFP.

Lockheed Raytheon and another arms manufacturer Northrop Grumman did not respond to AFP requests for comment.

General Dynamics said it has not raised its financial outlook since January while Boeing just said it is up to governments to decide how to spend money earmarked for defense.

- Competition among major powers -

Some weapons manufacturing executives hinted when they last released quarterly results in late January that the situation around the world would benefit them.

Greg Hayes Raytheon's CEO said that rising tensions in Asia the Middle East and Eastern Europe would lead to higher international sales -- not right away but later in 2022 and beyond.

His counterpart at Lockheed-Martin James Taiclet said he observed ""renewed great power competition"" that could trigger higher US military spending.

""The war in Ukraine reshuffles the geopolitical order in a way that hasn't really been seen in the past 30 years"" said Burkett Huey of Morningstar a financial services company.

""People are starting to realize that the world is a lot less safe and there's probably going to need to be increased investment in defense products which would benefit the contractors"" Huey said.

Eric Heginbotham a researcher at the MIT Center for International Studies said that for Western governments -- as has been the case for years in Asia -- ""there will be much less appetite for decreases"" in military spending.

In the United States President Joe Biden has proposed a four percent increase in the Pentagon budget. Inflation in America is running much higher but Biden at least did not propose spending cuts.

Germany long wary of high military budgets announced a major policy shift in late February after the Russian invasion of Ukraine saying it would immediately free up 100 billion euros to modernize its armed forces.

""Countries are going to be looking to increase interoperability with the United States which is really sort of the central pillar in NATO"" said Heginbotham.

In mid-March Germany said it would acquire F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed. It will take several years for them to be delivered and it is then when manufacturers get paid for the most part.

This ""sort of F-35-ification of European armies"" is good business for US military contractors and the US military also likes it because it means common operating platforms said Eric Gomez a defense policy expert at the Cato Institute.

""But on the other side it makes it harder for the United States to kind of ever consider stepping back from Europe as the Biden administration keeps saying that China is the big game in town"" said Gomez.

The latest product updates will go to a new record high number of Business Central cloud customers but Microsoft has stopped sharing the customer count with the outside world for proprietary reasons Microsoft GM Mike Morton told the Directions North America 2022 audience today. But taking away that metric means the company now sees the growth in Business Central as a meaningful corporate data point he said.

Business Central online customer growth is over 60 percent year over year Morton said and user counts are growing even faster as existing customers add BC users and larger organizations choose the product. If he could share the actual customer stats he said partners would see that the product's customer count is ""awesome"" and shows ""amazing growth"". He did not discuss how BC cloud growth breaks down between new customers and those migrating from Microsoft's older on-premises Dynamics ERPs.

The growth in the cloud customer base means that virtually any new BC prospect can now find customers with a similar profile in terms of industry size geography or other angles Morton said.

""Regardless of your industry regardless of your location regardless of the complexity of what you're doing there's probably another company out there running on Business Central in the cloud. It's not just ready for primetime it is primetime"" Morton told partners in the Directions audience.

Other Business Central stats Microsoft shared included:

Coalition and regional partner air forces joined a U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress from the 69th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron nicknamed the “Knighthawks” and two F-22 Raptors from the 1st Fighter Wing on a presence patrol mission across the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility (AoR) of Europe and the Middle East on March 29th.

The Stratofortress (Serial number: 61-0039) that took part in the mission is one of four currently deployed to Royal Air Force Fairford England. The aircraft flew over the East Mediterranean Arabian Peninsula and Red Sea before departing the region and returning to Fairford.

“With each bomber task force mission AFCENT and partner air forces demonstrate the strength of regional airpower” said Lt. Gen. Greg Guillot Ninth Air Force (AFCENT) commander. “An unprecedented nine countries flew with our B-52 today so this mission clearly signaled our ability to quickly bring forces to the theater and operate seamlessly with our partners during a training event that signals our combined commitment to regional stability and defense.”

The non-stop B-52H mission included fighter escorts from the Royal Air Force participating with FGR.4 Typhoons and regional partner nations such as the Czech Republic flying along side the B-52 with a pair of JAS-39C Gripen’s and Italian Air Force Typhoons enhancing regional stability and security through a show of combined strength and capability.

The flow of airpower throughout theatre during this presence patrol was significant due to the addition of F-22s which deployed from Joint Base Langlet-Eustis Virginia to the USCENTCOM AOR in February and deployed to Al Dhafra in the United Arab Emirates.

According to the U.S. Air Force the F-22 Raptors deployed to Al Dhafra  and participated in Operation Agile Spartan II and conducted Agile Combat Employment concepts throughout the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility which showcased U.S. Air Force’s flexibility to operate from any location in a contested environment.

Last time USAF F-22 deployed to UAE was when 12x Raptors operated from Al Dhafra Air Base between May and October 2018 as part of a pre-planned rotation to the Gulf. More recently at the end of June 2019 12 F-22 Raptors belonging to the 1st Fighter Wing and the 192nd Fighter Wing of the Virginia Air National Guard both from Joint Base Langley-Eustis Virginia deployed to the AFCENT AOR to respond to a short-notice deployment request. Back then the F-22 did not deploy to UAE but to Al Udeid Qatar for the first time “to defend American forces in the region.”

The B-52H and their aircrew are assigned to 5th Bomb Wing Minot Air Force Base North Dakota and flew the mission under Air Force Global Strike Command’s bomber task force mission-set and deployed to England before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Since then regular flights of B-52’s have been noted on the App Flight Radar 24 where B-52’s have been patrolling the skies over Eastern Europe. USCENTCOM through Ninth Air Force (AFCENT) has facilitated two bomber task force missions in 2022 as a demonstration of the U.S.-led coalition’s commitment to promoting regional stability. The last bomber-led mission across the Central Region involved one B-52H and occurred Feb. 14 2022."

The New York Post cites iwaspoisoned.com a website that tracks foodborne illness as the source of the complaints. The website has logged more than a hundred complaints of people becoming ill after eating a bowl of the General Mills cereal.

Consumers reported symptoms such as diarrhea nausea vomiting and stomach pains. “Got diarrhea vomiting high temperature and very sick for a few days from Lucky Charms” one person wrote.

General Mills says that the complaints are under review but does not believe there is a link between the cereal and the illness.

“Food safety is our top priority. We are aware of consumer claims submitted via the website and have conducted a thorough internal investigation” Andrea Williamson a General Mills spokesperson said in a statement. “Based on our food safety programs and review of consumer feedback we’ve received directly we do not believe these complaints are attributed to our product. We encourage consumers to please share their feedback directly with General Mills to ensure it is captured in our ongoing review.”

Complaints started rolling in last July but have spiked this year. Iwaspoisened.com’s founder Patrick Quade told the Post he alerted General Mills in September. The company never responded.

Since the Post broke the story the site has seen an uptick in consumer complaints regarding Lucky Charms.

Wendy Anderson was on Basswood Lake on the Ontario border fishing with Gerry Bibeau of Ely who in addition to being an excellent angler was a first-rate barber.

Fishing was good that day. The governor boated five walleyes and a similar number of northern pike. All the while nearby a Time magazine photographer clicked away as Bibeau and Anderson enjoyed themselves in the same way a million and more Minnesotans enjoy themselves every year.

Two months later a photo of Anderson holding a northern pike graced Time's cover together with a headline proclaiming ""The Good Life in Minnesota.''

The flattering story inside was not about fishing of course but about how at the time Minnesota successfully educated its kids paved its roads and paid its bills while providing a pathway to success for many of its residents.

August 13 1973 TIME magazine cover shows then Minnesota Gov. Wendell Anderson at a time — apparently different from today — when the state’s governor recognized the importance of recognizing and validating Minnesotans’ most popular pastime.

Any number of photos could have been used on the magazine's cover to trumpet the Minnesota story. The Minneapolis skyline. The Mississippi River as it bisects Minnesota north to south. The Guthrie Theater. Or perhaps one of the state's Fortune 500 companies say 3M or General Mills.

Instead the photo was of the beaming Minnesota governor wearing a folksy plaid shirt hoisting a northern pike.

The iconic image literally screamed ""Minnesota'' and the good life the state offered.

Any chance a similar photo of the current governor Tim Walz with a similar headline will grace any magazine cover anytime soon?

Not likely.

Not only because many Minnesotans believe that whatever Time magazine was celebrating about Minnesota 50-odd years ago has lost some of its sheen. But because Walz on May 14 will be the first Minnesota governor in more than a half-century to skip the formal celebration of what Anderson and Bibeau celebrated so joyously that day on Basswood: rocking in a boat fishing rods in hand passing the good time — fishing.

Walz of course would disagree.

True he would say he won't be the star this year of the state's traditional Governor's Fishing Opener. But on the state's big day he'll be fishing somewhere in Minnesota — and his people will let us know if he catches anything.

And the traditional Minnesota Governor's Fishing Opener whose roots date to 1948?

Well that's going by the wayside as the Star Tribune's Tony Kennedy has reported to be replaced by a handful of bogus non-events — moms can fish for free the weekend before the opener! — that in any other year would be considered April Fool's jokes and bad ones at that.

By tradition the Governor's Fishing Opener moves around the state community to community showcasing what each has to offer. Public spiritedness is the common denominator as volunteer guides and their boats — some 70 in all — are rounded up and funds are raised to pay for banquets parties and even bait.

These events are a lot of work and the economic payback is questionable. But Minnesotans are proud of the places they live and anyway they're hard-wired for potlucks. So they put their shoulders to the wheel and the annual celebrations unfold.

Yet the importance of the Governor's Fishing Opener — and similar gatherings that celebrate the pheasant and deer openers which Walz also miniaturized last year — are linked neither to their planning nor successful execution but to their metaphorical representation of what many Minnesotans value.

Fishing is part of this yes. But more important is the role Governor's Openers play in the continuation of state traditions and rituals both of which are vital to the health of individuals communities and entire cultures.

As life's touchstones traditions and rituals build trust among people by synching their behaviors in shared experiences researchers say. Among Minnesotans few days in Minnesota match the Fishing Opener for shared experiences and arguably fewer still bring more joy to more people. This includes those living in Minnesota's lakeside communities who for generations have hosted the state's chief executives on the Governor's Fishing Opener.

""When people act as one'' sociologists say ""they feel as one and build more trust in one another.''

Not only is the Fishing Opener a heartfelt holiday in Minnesota because it helps shape and organize people's lives but because it marks the end of winter and beginning of summer.

This rotation of seasons from cold weather to warm ice-covered lakes to open water is uniquely joyful in Minnesota because it ties residents closely to nature.

Just as anglers in May land on the state's lakes and rivers so do returning ducks geese and loons. Similarly beneath the water's surface walleyes and other fish swim into shallow water to spawn.

Amid these constant seasonal changes perhaps particularly in the northern latitudes rituals and traditions are all the more important and are lifelines for many people for whom consistency is otherwise elusive.

In defense of his Fishing Opener abandonment Walz raises the COVID flag. But last August as the delta variant was gathering steam in Minnesota Walz was maskless at Farm Fest in southern Minnesota delivering the keynote address. Later in August he was at the State Fair.

Gov. Tiim Walz found time to be the keynote speaker at Farm Fest last year.

But in between he couldn't manage to attend any one of the six days of Game Fair the annual gathering in Anoka of hunters and anglers that last year drew record crowds.

The governor is also said to have been bruised by the cold shoulder given him at times at last year's Governor's Fishing Opener. If so he should look to his predecessor Mark Dayton as a role model. Dayton not only endured extreme back and hip pain at times while participating in governor's openers he was greeted with ""Dayton go home'' signs at his last pheasant opener wingding for his support of streamside buffers.

Through it all Dayton smiled.

The last two years have perhaps been more disquieting to Minnesotans than to any previous generations in the state's history.

COVID. Social unrest. Job losses. The deaths of friends and family members — followed by funerals beamed to mourners connected by Zoom.

Resilient as people are many have been cast adrift and more now than ever they need structure something they can depend on.

This year on the Governor's Fishing Opener Walz isn't offering that.

Maybe next time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9tYWdhemluZS8yMDIyLzA0LzAzL3NvbHV0aW9uLWV2YW4tYmlybmhvbHpzLWFwcmlsLTMtY3Jvc3N3b3JkLWN1dHRpbmctY29zdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solution to Evan Birnholz's April 3 crossword “Cutting Costs”,Today’s is a quick post since I’m in Stamford Conn. for the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament (ACPT) but here’s a brief announcement: I don’t often get to write crosswords for other venues but I did this weekend!

That includes 344033 Chevrolet vehicles (down 19.6% year-over-year) and 121437 GMC (down 7.5%). The two brands sold only 457 plug-in electric vehicles in the US and that's all - a very disappointing 95% decrease year-over-year and 0.1% of the total volume.

While the company (and the entire automotive industry) is significantly impacted by manufacturing constraints demand appears to remain strong.

Specifically demand for plug-in electric vehicles is very high but it seems that GM needs more time to significantly rebound from the bottom of Q4 2021 when plug-in vehicle deliveries in the US hit rock bottom at 26 units.

In the long term the plan is to increase EV sales in North America to more than 1 million by the end of 2025.

And while Detroit isn’t quite the goliath it once was the automobile industry accounts for around three percent of the United States’ GDP today. For comparison the technology sector amounts to ten percent of the country’s gross domestic product.

That’s how we can have Elon Musk essentially begging Joe Biden to mention Tesla by name. Meanwhile President Biden is also test-driving the Ford F-150 Lightning and GMC Hummer EV. However General Motors hasn’t always had the best relationship with the Oval Office.

In 1950 President Harry Truman passed over General Motors to replace FDR’s “Sunshine Special” Lincoln. The Ford Motor Company won the contract and supplied ten Lincoln Cosmopolitans. Popular belief is that Truman did not choose General Motors because GM refused to give him vehicles to use during his election campaign in 1948 as the company didn’t want to be associated with the eventual loser. Very few people thought that Harry Truman would win in 1948 but that’s not the whole story.

Despite winning World War II the transition from a war economy to peacetime production was turbulent. Government contracts had become the by-far largest source of revenue for every corporation producing war materiel. According to General Motors the automaker produced $12.3 billion ($194 billion in 2022 U.S. dollars) in arms equipment and vehicles. General Motors even used the motto “Victory Is Our Business” during the war.

The federal government also had to detangle itself from the private sector. For example William Knudsen was President of General Motors until he left GM in 1940 to lead the government’s wartime production effort. In 1942 President Roosevelt directly commissioned Knudsen as a three-star general in the U.S. Army. As a civilian with no military background Knudsen was made a lieutenant general to take a similar position within the War Department.

And with millions of soldiers returning home inflation ran rampant. The inflation rate in the United States today is considered high at 7.9 percent. Inflation reached as high as 18 percent in late 1946. There was a wave of workers’ strikes across the coun try for better pay and working conditions. The most prominent was the United Auto Workers’ strike against General Motors.

The UAW strike began in November 1945 with the goals of a thirty percent wage increase and a price freeze on vehicle models. The effort was led by the UAW’s GM Department Director Walter Reuther. Reuther argued that GM was utilizing advances in manufacturing technology to lower work hours while also increasing prices to maximize profits to the detriment of American society. He asserted that fewer jobs and lower wages would lead to less tax revenue in local communities to build and maintain municipal services like hospitals schools and roads.

General Motors claimed that it couldn’t afford the wage increase and that GM must have the exclusive right to determine the prices of its products. As a response Reuther countered with a smaller wage increase demand on the condition that GM proves that it couldn’t afford the initial wage demand. GM refused to open its books to the UAW. The strike eventually ended on March 13th 1946 with a 17.5 percent (18.5-cent an hour) wage increase and no union input on product pricing. Two weeks later Walter Reuther was elected UAW President.

The Truman administration attempted and failed to end the strike early via mediation. Though the White House’s policy positions at the time aligned with the UAW. In the wake of the UAW strike the Republican Party gained control of both the House and the Senate after the 1946 midterm elections. President Truman infamously referred to this Congress as the “Do-Nothing Congress.”

To prevent further worker action the “Do-Nothing Congress” passed the Taft–Hartley Act in 1947  a bill drastically reducing the power of unions in the United States granted by the New Deal. Truman vetoed the bill and in an address to the nation stated “I vetoed this bill because I am convinced it is a bad bill. It is bad for labor bad for management and bad for the country.”

However a significant amount of Democrats crossed the aisle to support the bill. The Republicans had enough votes in Congress to override the veto and pass Taft–Hartley into law. It still remains in effect today.

Charles Erwin Wilson GM President during the strike would leave the company after being appointed Secretary of Defense during the Eisenhower administration.

General Motors would eventually win the contract to supply the Presidential S tate C ar in the early 1980s during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. GM has supplied the state limousine since except for a brief period during the term of George H. W.

Now The General has been caught benchmarking the all-electric Lucid Air a new battery-driven four-door sedan that just hit the market for the 2022 model year and slated to rival upcoming EV products from Cadillac.

The Lucid Air is the California-based EV startup’s very first passenger vehicle. Also known for providing the batteries for the Formula E racing series Lucid Motors is now stepping into the luxury passenger car business with this new four-door sedan.

The Lucid Air presents a highly aerodynamic exterior with a wheelbase that measures in at 116.5 inches and an overall length of 195.9 inches. The aesthetic is sleek and low with horizontal styling elements and clean design elements punctuated by technical details.

Inside the Lucid Air sports a luxurious cabin space and plenty of natural light. The sedan offers room for five passengers as well as an optional Executive Rear Seating upgrade for a rear-seat reclining function. Up front there are large digital screens for the gauges and infotainment specs while tech specs will include the addition of Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities through an over-the-air update expected in the next few years.

The Lucid Air is offered in a variety of trims and powertrains. The entry-level model equips a single electric motor for the rear wheels that provides 480 horsepower and 406 miles per charge while the rest of the lineup incorporates a dual-motor powertrain. The range-topper doles out 1111 horsepower and can complete the quarter mile in less than 10 seconds at 144 mph plus as much as 520 miles between plugs.

Pricing ranges greatly between the five available trim levels starting at $78900 for the Lucid Air Pure all the way up to $170500 for the range-topping Dream Edition Range.

Looking ahead Cadillac has several EVs on the horizon at least two of which will be sedans. One of these new Cadillac EV sedans will be the top-shelf hand-built Cadillac Celestiq while the other as-of-yet-unnamed sedan will be smaller than the Celestiq.

It’s also worth noting that Ford is currently benchmarking the Lucid Air as well as covered by our sister publication Ford Authority.

More than 175000 people have been assisted in gaining access to quality healthcare by the organisations in question with 13000 having become HIV/AIDS leaders and advocates in the southern US through them.

Speaking about the achievement Lil Nas X stated: “Communities all across the south like my home state of Georgia are being transformed by the work of COMPASS grantees.

“The Montero baby registry was created to send resources to grassroots groups serving the most vulnerable. Funds raised will go to people living with HIV and inspire a new generation of leaders who will keep pushing for HIV education and one day a cure.”

Ian L. Haddock the Normal Anomaly’s executive director added in a statement: “Lil Nas X has allowed our organisation to dream big.

“Through these funds we are not only able to create a brave space for community celebrate entrepreneurship and have queer musical artists headline a festival but we are able to continue to raise money through ticket sales to impact necessary programming including our community burial fund transgender services and programs that directly impact people living with and impacted by HIV.”

So what does it mean to lose access to this important part of the international economy and are there any viable alternatives?

Effective communication systems are the backbone of how the world stays connected from mobile phones email networks to banks.

What do banks use to communicate?

SWIFT – or the Society for Worldwide International Financial Telecommunications – is a system that banks use to securely send messages to each other. It is one of the key pillars of the financial world connecting more than 11000 member banks in some 200 countries and territories globally. Trillions of dollars'-worth of currency are sent across borders every single day – and it's largely thanks to the messages sent by SWIFT.

How does SWIFT work?

If you wish to transfer $1000 from your bank in Singapore to your friend in the UK you'll need a few key details; namely your friend's account number and his bank's SWIFT code. If the two banks have an account with each other they authenticate the payment request apply an exchange rate and the equivalent amount is deducted from your bank account for your friend to receive. If the banks don't have a relationship the message will be sent through intermediary banks until the payment request is verified for your friend to receive his or her money. ""It's really about secure automated payments"" Alistair Milne an economist at Loughborough University told CNBC. ""This is so that everything integrates with the bank systems.""

An RBI single from Ivan Melendez provided Texas with the go-ahead run in a 12-8 win over rival Oklahoma. Texas trailed by a 7-1 score after six innings at Globe Life Field but rallied to secure its 21st win of the year.

With the victory UT avoided going 1-3 in the week's four games against two rivals in Texas A&M and Oklahoma. The Longhorns instead secured the series victory over the Sooners and improved to 3-3 in Big 12 play.

""We're not gonna back down"" Texas senior Austin Todd said. ""We showed the grit and the fight that we have as a team. That's kind of what we practice every day.""

Texas (21-9) had opened its weekend with a 7-1 win on Friday. The Sooners bounced back the next day with a 4-2 conquest.

In the rubber match Oklahoma shortstop Peyton Graham guided the Sooners (16-10 3-3) to what looked like an insurmountable advantage. Over the first three innings Graham scored on a sacrifice bunt and a balk by UT pitcher Lucas Gordon. Graham added an RBI single in his third at-bat and later gave Oklahoma a 7-1 lead with a three-run home run in the sixth session.

Golden:Losses and pitching woes mount but it's no time to panic for Texas baseball

In the seventh inning UT finally responded to its Red River rivals.

Texas sent nine batters to the plate in the inning. Six reached base. Two of those Longhorns — Dylan Campbell and Murphy Stehly — hit three-run homers.

""We knew that as long as we had one out that we still had time to win the game"" Campbell said.

Noted Todd: ""The mood in the dugout was just chip away let's find a way to win. We had a big inning right there and tied it up.""

Behind those home runs Texas completed its largest comeback in four years. Back on March 30 2018 Texas fell into a 10-3 hole at Kansas State. The Longhorns rallied to tie that game but Kansas State eventually earned an 11-10 win.

This time around Texas wrote a happier ending. With the score still tied in the ninth Douglas Hodo III got to second base when Oklahoma outfielders Tanner Tredaway and Diego Muniz collided while trying to run down his routine fly ball.

Bohls:Texas' Steve Sarkisian is seeking wide receivers worthy of starting this fall

That set the stage for Melendez. The UT slugger had been hitless in his eight at-bats in the Oklahoma series but he singled home Hodo on the first pitch thrown by Javier Ramos.

Todd's third hit of the afternoon was a two-run single that gave Texas a 10-7 lead. Mitchell Daly then provided a two-run double to ensure that a Sooner setback had turned into a Texas triumph.

""That's a perfect example of Texas Fight"" Texas coach David Pierce said. ""It was incredible to watch this game the first four or five innings where it looked like we had no energy it looked like we were being dominated on the mound they manufactured runs. At the end of the day our team is tough. They never gave in.""

Key play: With two outs in the fifth inning Todd reached base when he chopped a baseball that Muniz couldn't handle at second base. The play was initially deemed an error but the official scorer later ruled it as an infield single.

Not only was that hit the first of UT's afternoon it was Todd's first since March 8. Todd had missed the previous 16 games with a shoulder injury. He returned to the Texas lineup on Sunday just as outfielder Eric Kennedy sat with an ailing hamstring.

A sixth-year senior who has lost portions of the 2018 2021 and 2022 seasons to injuries Todd was used as a designated hitter against the Sooners. Two weeks ago Pierce hinted that Todd's days of playing the outfield may be over.

Notable number: 6. Even though Globe Life Field just opened during the 2020 MLB season Sunday marked the sixth time that Texas has played at the ballpark in Arlington. The Longhorns are 2-4 in those games.

This likely won't be UT's last appearance at Globe Life Field this season. The home of the Texas Rangers will host the Big 12 Tournament next month.

A disastrous loss to close what had been a promising week.

After taking the middle game of their three-game series with No. 10 Texas on Saturday in thrilling fashion Oklahoma hit the diamond in Arlington TX one more time on Sunday looking for a series win against the rival Longhorns.

But despite a strong performance through six innings that saw them lead by six runs the Sooners went down in decisive fashion falling 12-8 to close the series at Globe Life Field.

Getting the start in the rubber match for Skip Johnson’s club was left-hander Chazz Martinez who continued to have success at Globe Life Field.

After allowing no earned runs in each of his first two outings at the home of the Texas Rangers Martinez worked into the sixth on Sunday allowing just one run and four hits to the Longhorns.

Helping Martinez settle in quickly was the Sooners snagging an early lead with Diego Muniz sacrificing a bunt to get a run across in the first to get OU ahead 1-0.

After tacking on another run on a Texas balk in the third the Sooners struck for two more in the fourth with Sebastian Orduno and Peyton Graham each picking up RBI hits to extend the advantage to 4-0.

Martinez ran into trouble in the sixth allowing the Longhorns to scratch a run across before Ben Abram came in out of the bullpen to pick up two outs and end the inning with Oklahoma still out in front 4-1.

The Sooners then doubled their lead in the bottom half of the inning with Graham connected on a three-run bomb to left field to make it a 7-1 ballgame and seemingly put things on ice.

But the Longhorns were very very far from finished.

In a disastrous seventh inning for the Oklahoma bullpen Texas plated six runs to even the game on two three-run home runs by Dylan Campbell and Murphy Stehly.

The score remained there into the ninth when the ultimate gut-punch came to the Sooners in the way of a defensive miscue.

With one out and nobody on base Longhorns center fielder Douglas Hodo lofted a lazy fly into left center that looked to be a sure out.

However Oklahoma left fielder Diego Muniz and center fielder Tanner Tredaway collided allowing the ball to fall harmlessly to the turf.

In very baseball fashion the very next pitch was then an RBI single off of the bat of Texas first baseman Ivan Melendez to put the Horns in front 8-7 - which opened the floodgates.

The Longhorns extended their lead by four more runs from there to hold a 12-7 edge heading into the bottom of the ninth.

To their credit Oklahoma wouldn't go down without a fight in their final hacks scoring a run on a Jimmy Crooks RBI single to trim the deficit to 12-8.

But that would be it for OU as Texas then got the final two outs they needed to finish the job.

The devastating loss dips the Sooners down to 16-10 on the season and drops them back down to .500 in Big 12 play at 3-3.

GS,Goldman Sachs,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzAyLzQtcmVhc29ucy1nb2xkbWFuLXNhY2hzLWlzLWEtYnV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Reasons Goldman Sachs Is a Buy,"The renowned 153-year old investment bank is flexing its muscles in the consumer market and even exploring cryptocurrency

When the market offers you the chance to buy an industry-leading business with an iconic brand on sale it never hurts to take a closer look. One such example in the current market is renowned financial services giant Goldman Sachs (GS 1.25%) whose shares are down 13% year to date and 22% from their 52-week high.

Retention

Let's start by looking at one of the main reasons Goldman shares have declined.



Shares sold off in February because the storied investment bank missed earnings estimates in its most recent quarter. The primary culprit for the miss was a 23% increase in operating expenses year over year driven largely by increased pay and compensation for employees.



While it's not ideal to see a large increase in operating expenses I think Goldman deserves some slack here because like many other businesses it needed to raise pay to retain employees amid the shift to remote work while the Great Resignation led to unprecedented employee turnover and a sea change in the employer-employee relationship. I can understand a company like Goldman paying up to retain talented workers in a competitive market rather than to be in the unenviable situation many other companies find themselves in struggling to find enough workers and having trouble keeping the ones that they have.

Furthermore if this was a one-time blip in an unprecedented year then this could be a good buying opportunity as the company gets expenses and earnings back on track.

Flexing its muscles in consumer

On a positive note Goldman is taking the brand equity from its renowned investment banking division and bringing it to the consumer market. Total loans for its consumer banking platform Marcus grew from $106.4 billion to $146.31 billion year over year and Chief Executive Officer David Solomon says he expects consumer revenue to grow from $1.5 billion to $4 billion over the next two years.

Marcus is gaining some serious traction in credit cards despite its short tenure in the business demonstrating the acumen that Goldman brings with it and how its strong brand has helped it to enter consumer banking. For example in early 2022 Marcus took over a co-branded card with General Motors that helps customers earn points toward new GM vehicles and pays seven times points on purchases at GM. This card was previously with Capital One so this looks like a big win for Marcus over an established incumbent. Marcus also has a partnership with perhaps the most visible brand in the world Apple to launch a branded credit card.

From crypto skeptic to zealot?

While it is not yet a meaningful part of the company's business and it is too early to know what its ultimate strategy will be it is exciting to see the 153-year-old bank change its stance on cryptocurrency and begin to enter the market. Just two years ago Goldman said that crypto was not a real asset class but in March 2022 the company completed its first over-the-counter Bitcoin transaction and the company now has trading desks for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and derivatives. Goldman made a splash this March when it changed its landing page to prominently feature Web3 and the metaverse. It's very early in this story but I like the fact that Goldman is skating to where the puck is going by adapting to new opportunities. Furthermore with the strength of its prestigious brand (not to mention its high pay) there's no reason to think that Goldman won't be able to attract some of the best and brightest minds in crypto to further build out its strategy here.

Super cheap

Shares of the financial services giant look like a bargain no matter how you slice it. The shares now trade at just 5.6 times earnings which is much cheaper than the broader stock market while the share-price-to-book-value is just under 1.2. Book value is basically the value you would have left if you liquidated the company and distributed its assets so Goldman is only trading at a 20% premium to that low bar. Lastly a price-to-earnings-growth value of 0.5 means that Goldman also looks undervalued for a company with its earnings growth. In addition to this favorable valuation Goldman also offers investors the added bonus of a dividend yield of 2.4%.

Is Goldman Sachs a buy?

Goldman Sachs is a global financial powerhouse that looks like it is on sale right now. And given the company's attractive valuation growing consumer business and nascent but intriguing forays into crypto it looks like a solid buy from here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMDMvZmludGVjaC1yb3VuZHVwLWdvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtYnV5cy1hbm90aGVyLXN0YXJ0dXAtZmFzdC1oaXRzLWEtc3BlZWQtYnVtcC1hbmQtYmFhcy1nZXRzLWhvdHRlci_SAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzAzL2ZpbnRlY2gtcm91bmR1cC1nb2xkbWFuLXNhY2hzLWJ1eXMtYW5vdGhlci1zdGFydHVwLWZhc3QtaGl0cy1hLXNwZWVkLWJ1bXAtYW5kLWJhYXMtZ2V0cy1ob3R0ZXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fintech Roundup: Goldman Sachs buys another startup Fast hits a speed bump and BaaS gets hotter,"Welcome to my weekly fintech-focused column. I’ll be publishing this every Sunday so in between posts be sure to listen to the Equity podcast and hear Alex Wilhelm Natasha Mascarenhas and me riff on all things startups! And if you want to have this hit your inbox directly once it officially turns into a newsletter on May 1 sign up here.

Fintech M&A hasn’t been as robust as one might expect in recent months. So when Goldman Sachs announced this week it was buying NextCapital — a fintech company that provides automated advice to corporate retirement plan participants — my ears perked up.

NextCapital was a fintech company before fintech became cool. Founded in 2013 (or 2014 depending on the source) the Chicago-based company has raised over $82 million in funding over its lifetime from investors such as FinTech Collective and Oak HC/FT according to Crunchbase.

In a statement Luke Sarsfield co-head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management said: “Employers are looking to provide their employees tailored solutions and customizable advice that can better support individual saving and investing needs to help improve retirement savings outcomes. We believe personalization represents the future of retirement savings and will drive the next wave of innovative retirement solutions.”

The move is an interesting one as the investment giant has for years been strategically scooping up fintech companies. Again according to Crunchbase Goldman Sachs has acquired 27 companies over time. Last September it announced it was acquiring buy now buy later fintech GreenSky for $2.24 billion in an all-stock deal that was a reflection of its continued push into consumer finance. That deal closed last week.

In the case of NextCapital which uses algorithms and automation to allow users to invest in retirement funds Goldman didn’t say how much it was shelling out. But CNBC reported that “the acquisition ranks among the top five asset management deals New York-based Goldman has done according to the Financial Times.”

It’s another example of an incumbent recognizing that it makes more sense to buy a company that has developed technology that it wants rather than building it out itself — a process that would take far longer and require more resources than a simple acquisition would.

Early investor FinTech Collective said it backed NextCapital at a time when robo advisors were just coming to market.

“We felt that the underlying infrastructure supporting the shift from investment product to digital advice was a more durable interesting space to be allocating capital to” the firm said in a recent newsletter.

It also noted that Goldman’s intent to buy NextCapital “follows several moves by multiline incumbents (e.g. Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan) to diversify into steadier income streams and to build out their own stacks in wealth and asset management.”

Over the years Crunchbase data indicates that Goldman has also invested in more than 900 companies and led 343 of those investments. At the height of the dot.com boom in the first quarter of 2000 the bank had invested in a record 53 startups. In Q2 of 2000 that number dipped slightly to 46. And of course by Q3 it had plunged to just 13.

Its investment activity started picking up again starting in late 2018 and the bank backed 30 startups in the fourth quarter of 2019 alone. In Q1 of this year it wrote checks to 17 companies according to Crunchbase data including to a few that TechCrunch has covered including corporate spend startup Ramp tech-enabled homebuilder Homebound and Indian food delivery giant Swiggy.

I for one will be curious to see who else Goldman backs or buys in Q2.

Fast slows its roll

Last week The Information published a piece revealing that Fast which offers a one-click checkout service for online merchants generated just $600000 in revenue in 2021. Its biggest competitor Bolt raised “roughly 50 times that figure” according to The Information.

TechCrunch last reported on Fast in January of 2021 when the startup raised a $102 million Series B financing led by Stripe. Other backers include Index Ventures Susa Ventures and Global Founders Capital. When it tried later in the year to raise a $100 million Series C financing at a valuation of over $1 billion it didn’t find any takers according to the Information.

But wait there’s more. The publication went on to report on April 1 (and no it was not an April Fool’s joke) that Fast was seeking a buyer after its failed fundraise attempt.

Reportedly the startup hired about 400 employees last year and burned through about $10 million a month for most of that period; $600000 divided by 12 = $50000 in revenue a month. Spending $10 million a month when your product is only generating $50000 in the same time frame doesn’t seem smart. As my extremely talented colleague Ingrid Lunden put it: “This is the story for a lot of startups but maybe particularly ironic when it’s a fintech startup built to process and make money…A lot of these payment companies are built precisely on economies of scale. Margins are super thin on the transactions and the tech costs a lot to build and operate which is why growth/reach/size matter.”

Add to this equation a CEO — Domm Holland — who is known for his “brash style” and had his share of controversy in Australia prior to starting Fast. Holland’s former startup Tow.com.au which aimed to be “the Uber of towing” failed in what at least one person described as a “disaster.” In February NPR published an article noting that Holland’s previous venture was embroiled “in a multimillion-dollar billing dispute with the Australian state government over towing and impounding fees that led to the startup’s liquidation in 2018.”

It added that “the way Holland has rewritten and polished his past raises questions about how far the envelope can be pushed before crossing ethical lines.”

Also according to NPR as Ilya Strebulaev a professor of finance who studies the venture capital industry at Stanford University told NPR: “Failure is not a curse. But what’s important is how the failure happened.”

So what’s next for Fast? Will Holland resign? Will Bolt scoop it up? Or will some retailer just buy its technology? Or will it just die a slow death?

TechCrunch reached out to Fast for comment. It had not responded by the time of writing.

Fundings across the globe

Funding activity seemed to pick up some this week although still not as crazy as it felt last year.

Here’s just a trio that I covered:

I got the scoop on Cross River Bank raising $620 million in a round co-led by Andreessen Horowitz — going from “tiny to mighty with a $3B+ valuation and a crypto-first strategy.”

Cross River Bank is not just any bank. The Fort Lee New Jersey-based institution is also a technology infrastructure provider that quietly powers lending and payments for many of the fintechs that top VCs are also backing — a reverse of sorts of the more common fintech-powering-bank dynamic we’re used to. As fintech has exploded in recent years so has Cross River Bank’s business — as well as investor interest.

Founder and CEO Gilles Gade told me the company which powers the likes of Affirm and Coinbase views crypto as front and center of its future efforts. Profitable since 2010 the bank is also ready for an international expansion.

Notably David George general partner of the Growth Fund at Andreessen Horowitz told TechCrunch:

When Coinbase was first starting out and looking for a partner bank many traditional financial institutions had blanket policies that prevented them from participating in crypto. Cross River on the other hand had the foresight to lean into this new frontier and support Coinbase and many other leading crypto companies who are still happy partners to this day.

I also got the exclusive on a trio of Palantir alums who just raised $25 million in a Series B led by Founders Fund for their new finance startup Mosaic. This is interesting because both Palantir and Founders Fund were co-founded by Peter Thiel.

“Mosaic is born out of our experience as CFOs and as domain experts over the past decade” CEO Bijan Moallemi said. “We are trying to create a Strategic Finance category. If you think about the way that CFOs do their work 80% of their time is mostly manual right? It’s pulling down data from disparate systems it’s doing ad hoc Excel formulas it’s often one-off analyses. Only 20% of their time is more strategic making an impact on the business.”

Mosaic wants to flip that ratio on its head.

Meanwhile I also wrote about January which wants to use technology to make debt collection a more humane and efficient process. That company just raised $10 million to keep growing.

“We started off by solving the really really hard problem of how do you collect at scale in a really compliant manner or really compassionate but still really effective manner and that enabled us to solve some of the larger problems in the industry” CEO Jake Cahan told TechCrunch. “We have to stop treating individuals like criminals and start making the system work because debt isn’t going away.”

And here’s more that either my awesome colleagues wrote or that I thought were interesting but just couldn’t get to:

Yonder a U.K.-based fintech founded in 2021 raised £20 million ($26 million) in a round led by Northzone and LocalGlobe to bring its lifestyle credit card to market. The company says its vision is to “rebuild customers’ relationship with credit.” Its three co-founders are Clearscore alumni who have pulled in talent from (Transfer)Wise and Monzo to build out Yonder’s team.

CEO Tim Chong came up with the concept soon after he moved to the U.K. from Australia and attempted to apply for a credit card. Despite having a “solid” credit history back home the best he could qualify for was an Amex with a “child-safe” credit limit and hefty fees. Yonder’s first aim is to solve the problem of access to credit cards for expats and anyone with a thin credit file with a sign-up process and credit suitability evaluation based on transaction history from daily spending habits instead of relying entirely on traditional credit checks which Chong feels are discriminatory.

Payments and infrastructure oh my

From the wonderful and oh-so-talented Christine Hall: Payment cards provider CarbonPay which focuses on sustainability now has a corporate prepaid offering called CarbonPay Business Ctrl. Visa and Stripe are powering the card and businesses can get physical cards lodge cards or virtual cards and pay using ApplePay and GooglePay in the U.S.

Whenever company employees in the U.S. and U.K. use the card their carbon footprint is offset automatically. For example for every £1 or $1.50 spent CarbonPay says it will offset 1 kilogram of carbon dioxide at no extra cost. The company keeps track of carbon footprints through a partnership with sustainability-as-a-service company ecolytiq.

Later this year CarbonPay plans to unveil another business card option and personal card offering

Our own Romain Dillet reported on how ​​Visa surprised the European fintech industry last year when it announced that it would acquire Tink for €1.8 billion ($2.15 billion at the time of the deal). Klarna now wants to compete directly with Tink with a new business unit that has its own brand — Klarna Kosma.

Like Tink Klarna offers an open banking application programming interface (API) with Klarna Kosma. Tink and Klarna are also both headquartered in Stockholm Sweden. There are other open banking API companies such as TrueLayer and Plaid. And it’s been a competitive space as Visa also tried to acquire Plaid but that deal fell through.

With this new strategy Klarna is essentially saying that it’s open for business. If you’re building a financial product and need to interact with bank accounts you have one more option.

Also Fortune reported that payments giant Adyen on March 31 announced that it is moving into providing banking services — making it a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) provider. Alex Wilhelm and I talked about how this is another example of how so many companies are realizing the value of providing infrastructure. In this case Adyen says it is launching a suite of embedded financial products that will allow platforms and marketplaces to create tailored financial experiences for their users including small business owners and individual merchants. As Alex put it: “Stripe did this but now everyone is coming for banking infra I think as a way to drive more enterprise software revenues and get away from consumer incomes.”

Meanwhile fellow fintech enthusiast Ron Shevlin in February summed it up nicely in a recent Forbes piece writing that “the rise of interest in banking as a service is the result of the growing embedded finance trend.”

In other infrastructure news…

Now dLocal and AstroPay co-founder Sergio Fogel has teamed up with AstroPay’s former head of product Gonzalo Strauss to launch another fintech out of Montevideo Uruguay called Datanomik. Datanomik’s goal is to connect financial institutions across LatAm through its B2B open finance API which gathers a company’s banking information on one platform Strauss told TechCrunch as told by Anita Ramaswamy who is starting a crypto-focused podcast with Lucas Matney (exciting!).

Dimas Ardian | Bloomberg via Getty Images

Geopolitical tensions around the world have been on the rise but Southeast Asia's markets may offer relative safety to investors according to top investment banks. As we enter the next quarter of 2022 CNBC asked analysts from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Asset Management which Southeast Asian markets were their top picks. Southeast Asian stocks have underperformed and been ""largely ignored by global investors for a decade"" said Timothy Moe Goldman's chief Asia Pacific equity strategist. Indonesia is a top Southeast Asian pick for both Wall Street banks.

Indonesia: Banking and commodity plays

""In Indonesia we are structurally positive on the banks as the majority of the population are still unbanked or underbanked. We are currently positioned in the leading private sector and also state-owned banks as they have been proactively driving digital adoption to accelerate financial penetration"" said Desmond Loh a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management. Strong commodity prices have also been beneficial for export earnings in Indonesia as well as the country's trade balance and that's set to support the Indonesian rupiah as well as the nearer term growth outlook in Indonesia he said.

Global commodity prices have been on a rollercoaster ride since the war in Ukraine broke out after Russia's invasion in late February. Russia is a major oil producer while Ukraine is a major exporter of other commodities such as wheat and corn. As of Monday morning in Asia international benchmark Brent crude futures have risen more than 30% so far this year.

Vietnam and Singapore

JPMorgan Asset Management also likes Vietnam which Loh termed a ""star performer in the past few years"" in economic resiliency and growth. Vietnam is one of the few economies globally to have seen positive economic growth throughout the pandemic he added. ""To capitalize on the growth we are positioned in high quality consumer proxies and banks"" he said without naming specific stocks. Meanwhile Singapore is the other Southeast Asian that Goldman Sachs likes. There are three main reasons why the investment bank likes Indonesia as well as Singapore said Moe. Improving economic and growth momentum from a region recovering belatedly from Covid-related setbacks. A banking sector that is heavily weighted in stock indexes and set to benefit from a switch to tighter monetary policy and rising interest rates. The ""gradual emergence"" of digital economy firms which are being included in Indonesia and Singapore indexes. Indonesia's Jakarta Composite has risen more than 7% this year while Vietnam's VN index is up about 1% in the same period. Singapore's Straits Times index has gained more than 9%. In comparison MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan has dropped 6%. On Wall Street the S&P 500 is down 4.6% so far this year while the pan-European Stoxx 600 has dropped about 6%. Investors have in recent weeks been grappling with a range of concerns from the commodity price spike triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine to a rising interest rate environment as major central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve seek to fight inflation.

Shelter from geopolitical tensions

Southeast Asia is ""relatively insulated"" from rising geopolitical tensions in Europe as Russia and Ukraine account for less than 1% of regional exports according to Loh. ""Escalation in geopolitical risks renders near-term tailwind for commodity prices to underpin the strength of ASEAN's commodity-exporter markets"" he said referring to the 10-member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

No 'exodus of outflows' expected

Global investors have been repositioning in the last few weeks in anticipation of more aggressive moves ahead by the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening but the analysts expect the impact on Southeast Asia to be relatively smaller compared to before. In March the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018 and Fed Chair Jerome Powell subsequently pledged to take tough action on inflation that is ""much too high."" The prospect of more rate hikes ahead by the Fed has raised concerns of capital outflows and currency depreciation in Southeast Asia's emerging markets a phenomenon seen in 2013 during the ""taper tantrum"" that saw bond yields spike after the Fed hinted asset purchases could wind down.

That gave me space to take initiative and innovate.

Sam Davis: Shaping a Personal Brand and “Legal 2.0”

Before moving his career in-house to EQRx and then taking the role of general counsel for Scipher Medicine Sam Davis pitched and created the McDermott Rise program. That spirit of solutions-focused innovation in the legal profession has formed the bedrock of his personal brand.

How did you benefit from your training at McDermott?

In addition to cultivating an overall firm brand McDermott helps its people build their own individual brands. That gave me space to take initiative and innovate. One example of that was McDermott Rise an idea I was able to pitch and take to execution. Nothing like it had ever been done in the legal profession and it’s the career accomplishment that gives me the most pride.

How did you come up with the idea for McDermott Rise?

George Floyd’s murder in 2020 was a watershed moment for companies and our society and everyone was looking for ways to contribute to a solution. Plenty were starting funds or giving to charities but I saw an article in the Wall Street Journal about Goldman Sachs and others in the investment community dedicating efforts to finding and funding Black entrepreneurs and company founders.

That inspired me to think about a similar model in the legal industry offering our services to help set Black-owned businesses up for success. To see the companies that have gone through the Rise incubation process receiving funding and experiencing tremendous success is amazing.

Where has your post-McDermott career path taken you?

I’m a life sciences and transactional lawyer and there’s a huge demand for us in the Boston biotech scene. I had recently joined McDermott when the pandemic hit and deals slowed down and I reached out to my network to generate opportunities. A venture capitalist contact introduced me to EQRx an exciting new company that was described to me as the “Amazon of pharma.” I went into the meeting thinking it was a pitch for new business and it turned into a job interview.

Joining EQRx as vice president of legal affairs seemed like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help build an innovative organization and it was a shorter journey than I envisioned. They generated so much attention and raised so much money that they ended up having to go public quickly within a year after I joined.

I wasn’t sure that I wanted to be general counsel of a public company and around that time I heard from another contact—the CEO of Scipher Medicine where I currently work as general counsel. I helped EQRx get through a $500 million Series B raise and took them through the SPAC process last summer and I joined Scipher in September 2021.

Are there any McDermott relationships that continue to support you?

The different types of transactions I was exposed to at McDermott were helpful to me going in-house. Since leaving I’ve turned to subject matter experts for support: Michelle Strowhiro has done a great job navigating the pandemic-related chaos of constantly evolving employee policies and mandates. And Tina Martini did an incredible job working with me on EQRx’s trademark approach. I also talk with Harris Siskind from time to time. He and Ira Coleman provided tremendous support for the McDermott Rise initiative.

Is there an accomplishment or initiative you’ve worked on that you’re particularly proud of?

Outside of my company I’m deeply embedded in a working group called BIIG which brings together people from venture capital firms and venture-backed biotech companies to develop diversity best practices and toolkits.

At Scipher I’m also working on an initiative we call “Legal 2.0” which is the next step in a process I began with EQRx: building the legal department of the future and re-engineering every facet of the legal process to create a frictionless modern and streamlined system.

When I joined EQRx I started identifying inefficiencies in standard contracting processes and working to modernize them. For example in documents we moved away from legalese jargon to plain English. Our mission was to improve efficiency speed up negotiations and reflect the company’s identity as an innovative force. Starting with the NDA it was well received and eventually transformed all agreements and processes cut down on legal costs and created more collaborative negotiations."

Submitted

The past two years have been difficult for everyone. The pandemic temporarily decreased the amount of patrons within the physical library but we are excited to welcome everyone back in to our buildings and share with the community our expanded services.

In addition on April 6 of this year #LibraryGivingDay will be occurring. Library Giving Day is a one-day fundraising event with the goal of encouraging people who depend on and enjoy public libraries to donate to their individual library system. And in turn that support will go toward the incredible programs services and materials provided by local libraries all over the country.

Board Member Natalia Menjivar says “The West Hartford Public library is constantly innovating finding new and novel ways to extend resources to more patrons provide programming to all and offer patrons access to new technology. The library’s mission is to offer these services and resources at no cost. Once a year #LibraryGivingDay gives us the opportunity to show support to the library that gives so much to its community.”

In late 2021 the West Hartford Public Library introduced the Study Pod at the Noah Webster Library and Smart Lockers at the Bishops Corner Library. The Study Pod offers a quiet place for individuals or small groups to study meet or work together with limited distractions.

Library patron Alison says “I am on a Zoom call and it’s perfect for that!” The Smart Lockers replaces and enhances curbside pickup service at the Bishops Corner Library allowing library patrons the flexibility of picking up their holds at their convenience.

Adding to the library’s innovative services the Noah Webster Library introduced Studio 20 South in early 2022 a unique digital maker studio that is a creative collaborative and educational space that provides dedicated equipment computers software production and co-working furnishings.

Library Director Laura Irmscher says “We are so excited to welcome our patrons back to expanded in-person services this spring. The library has a slate of exciting programs coming up from the West Hartford Reads! event in April to lively outdoor programs in Blue Back Square this summer. Through the support of the Foundation we can add to the in-person services that have been missed during the pandemic with innovative services that respond to what the community needs today and going forward.”

Let’s not forget about the amazing and steadfast services that the West Hartford Public Library has always had including downloadable resources discussion groups programs and information assistance. Many of these programs are possible from grant funding and from the community that donates to our Library Foundation.

On Wednesday April 6 2022 please consider making a donation to our Library Foundation on #LibraryGivingDay. The West Hartford Public Library loves to give back to the community who utilizes our services. Click here for more details.

The prospect of new housing paired with shops restaurants and entertainment venues on 3 acres just east of the historic and recently-renovated State Office Building on Capitol Avenue can’t come soon enough for some area residents.

“That parking lot has been an asphalt desert in the center of our neighborhood for decades” Robin Zaleski chairwoman of the South Downtown or SoDo Neighborhood Revitalization Zone and a resident for 17 years. “To drive up Capitol Avenue or Hudson Street and see a sea of cars or a sea of asphalt — depending on what time of day it was — did not make our neighborhood feel like a neighborhood.

“There was no there there.”

The “Bushnell South” area is bordered to the east by the South Downtown or “SoDo” residential neighborhood where homeowners say redevelopment should include options to purchase not just rentals. This view is looking west from Main Street and the steeple of the South Church.

Now the Capital Region Development Authority is seeking developers for the state-owned parking lot the first of a half-dozen between Washington and Main streets on both sides of Capitol Avenue.

Those lots — some owned by the state others privately controlled — plus other existing structures could be redeveloped as part of “Bushnell South” a $500 million project envisioned to transform the 20-acre area over the next decade.

The vision is to foster a stronger walkable connection between Bushnell Park the nearby hospital district and Park Street extending beyond to Colt Park. The redevelopment would foster more vibrancy and boost economic vitality of the area.

A rendering of what Bushnell South could look like a decade from now. The state-owned parking lot for which the Capital Region Development Authority is now seeking one or more developers is in the foreground in the center just to the right of the recently-renovated State Office Building and new park.

CRDA said it is looking for developers with experience building from the ground up in cities. Once one or more is chosen in late spring or early summer plans will be drawn up based on a consultant’s vision outlined last year.

Financing will need to be cobbled together likely a combination of private and public funding. Construction could begin next year or in 2024 CRDA said.

“We know it will take a long time” Zaleski said. “Construction does not go fast. Supply-chain issues are just making it longer so we know it’s not going to be a magical overnight situation. But we are excited that there is finally going to be some development there.”

21st-century catalyst

A century ago when The Bushnell was erected the Capitol Avenue area already was in the midst of change. The street was still lined with homes and shaded by trees but its wealthiest residents had moved and built grand mansions in the city’s West End.

City observers in the late 1920s wondered if a new phase of development also would follow and whether the building of the Georgian Colonial-style Bushnell would be the catalyst for a new era of store office and apartment buildings.

The historic State Office Building at 165 Capitol Avenue in Hartford and the vast parking lot shows how increased commuting from the suburbs starting in the 1940s created the need for more parking. This area of the city was once built with homes and rowhouses some of which still survive near Main Street.

In the decades that followed government edifices rose in the area followed by steady expansion of parking lots needed as workers increasingly commuted from the suburbs. But the shops restaurants and apartments were never built even through the 1970s and ’80s when there was a push for redevelopment in the area.

The state-funded renovation of the State Office Building completed in late 2019 provided a 21st century catalyst.

The $205 million project — including a new parking garage and a park along the east side of the building — also came at a time when the state opened up public financing for housing projects in and around Hartford to boost revitalization.

A new $16 million state-funded parking garage at right and another parking garage closer to the State Office Building were built to accommodate state employee parking crucial to releasing parking lots for redevelopment.

The parking lots in the area were mostly used by state employees. To free up the asphalt lots for redevelopment a second state-financed $16 million garage also was built on Capitol next to a church.

The second garage will be used by state employees Bushnell patrons and future residents of the area as part of a larger “district” parking plan. The garage also may be opened to the public later this year.

The parking garages were part of a complex choreography unfolding over several years to set the stage for future redevelopment on the surface lots.

‘A different housing stock’

A consultant’s plan for the Bushnell South area last spring called for as many as 1200 residential units — both rented and owned — restaurants shops and entertainment venues.

The first 3 acres would include a broad pedestrian promenade with restaurants and space for outdoor events. The promenade would be between the new park and a block of 372 apartments and townhouses.

The buildings could be 4 or 5 stories along Capitol with residential units over storefronts and lower along the Buckingham Street side.

This map shows the ownership of land in the Bushnell South redevelopment area of Hartford. The Capital Region Development Authority is seeking one or more developers for “Parcel 4.” The areas shaded in pink are owned by Spinnaker Real Estate Partners of South Norwalk except for “Parcel A.”

The housing alone could cost about $75 million by one estimate.

Remnants of what the area looked liked before the parking lots are still visible on Capitol Avenue and Buckingham Street near Main Street.

Jane Macy-Painter and her husband Earl Henrichon have lived in a brownstone condominium on Buckingham Street for 17 years and are raising their daughter Lillian 9 there.

While rentals are key to revitalization redevelopment in the area also needs to include properties that can be purchased to boost homeownership in the heart of the city.

“For downsizers and families to have a more diverse — for different age groups and demographics — it’s important to have a different housing stock” Macy-Painter said.

‘How is the market absorbing all of this?’

How quickly redevelopment of the first parking lot will unfold will be heavily influenced by the ability to put together financing and the pace of leasing from a growing number of apartments in the downtown area.

Michael W. Freimuth CRDA’s executive director said the quasi-public agency hopes to build a pool of funds from private corporations — traditionally involved in city projects — to help fund the construction of new housing in Bushnell South.

Those funds would likely be invested in the project as low-cost loans. The idea is patterned after Cigna and Stanley Black & Decker lending $1.7 million to the first phase of the mixed-use redevelopment around Dunkin’ Donuts Park the city’s minor league ballpark.

The pace of Bushnell South’s redevelopment on the parking lot also will be determined by apartment leasing primarily in conversion projects elsewhere in the Bushnell South area.

Spinnaker Real Estate Partners of South Norwalk is expected to be a strong force in the development of Bushnell South. It has acquired the historic office building at 55 Elm Street in foreground at right. Spinnaker is expected to begin converting the 1926 structure into 160 apartments this spring. Spinnaker also has acquired other parking lots near the building for future development.

Those projects include the conversion of the historic 55 Elm St. on Pulaski Circle and across from Bushnell Park. The $63 million project will create of 160 rentals in the 1926 structure. Work is expected to begin this spring. The project is headed by Spinnaker Real Estate Partners a developer from South Norwalk which is expected to be a strong force in shaping Bushnell South’s development.

In addition to 55 Elm the former offices of the attorney general and originally built for the Connecticut General Life Insurance Co. Spinnaker has acquired other parking lots nearby for future development.

The state of Connecticut also is selling two historic office buildings at the corner of Elm and Trinity streets for conversion to an undetermined number of apartments.

The former Orient Insurance Co. edifice on Hartford’s Trinity Street was built in 1905 and has been owned and occupied by the state for decades. It is one of two historic structures being sold by state. Both are part of “Bushnell South.” The Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts is visible at right.

So far occupancy in newer apartment projects in and around downtown are in the mid-90s or better. But rents in Greater Hartford as elsewhere in the state and the country are soaring and starting to squeeze out potential tenants.

Cost of construction also has increased amid supply-chain disruptions in the pandemic.

A report from CRDA showed a robust pipeline of apartments including nearly 500 in construction and another 750 that will likely commence later this year.

Freimuth said the timetable for the Bushnell South parking lot redevelopment will depend on rental projects that come online before it.

“A lot is going to be ‘How is the market absorbing all of this?'” Freimuth said.

Hasbro is re-releasing Cyberverse One-Step Wheeljack In Bumblebee Buzzworthy Line

So one wonders has Wheeljack really become a big seller? Do you still see One Step Wheeljacks in your stores? Do you see the different packaging versions on pegs at the same time gathering dust? Or does he indeed sell like hot cakes? I bring this up because Wheeljack is also getting similar attention in lines that do target fans along with kids. He was in Earhtrise Kingdom Netflix line (with a slight deco change) and will be reissued in Legacy as well. So in every package change ever since he was released. Do you see that toy on shelves? Or is he sold out as well? Just something I wanted to point out and ask while letting you see what's coming next in the Buzzworthy Bumblebee line for kids.















Most fans reading this aren't paying attention to the one step toys which makes sense they aren't made for us. But Hasbro seems to pay attention quite a bit as they are the cheaper option for parents of young kids and the main entrance point for many young kids with Transformers toys. So they definitely want to keep those shelves stocked. I'm just finding it interesting who they keep those shelves stocked with. Thanks to JTPrime17 we now have the latest news that the Buzzworthy Bumblebee line will be getting one steps reissued to give Target shelves even more stock for a younger audience and the characters they chose are Bumblebee Shockwave and Wheeljack. Bumblebee makes sense it is his line and Shockwave is an accompanying villain figure and that one step has not been reissued often. But Wheeljack is something else. That toy was reissued with almost every single package change in the Cyberverse line ever since he was released. You can see all those package variations below thanks to a compilation by Nevermore.So one wonders has Wheeljack really become a big seller? Do you still see One Step Wheeljacks in your stores?

Its getting to that level with the generations figure too I think. First in Earthrise then Kingdom and now rumored to be in Legacy again. Hopefully this means Que (DotM Wheelack) is coming soon to boost the ranks. Posted by LinaNui on April 3rd 2022 @ 3:08pm CDT

Maybe the stores are just sending back all the Wheeljack figures that didn't sell. And Hasbro is repackaging them and sending them back again Posted by DeathReviews on April 3rd 2022 @ 4:12pm CDT

We know that's not the case since Hasbro does not buy back stock from retailers. That's why Transformers can end up on liquidation.

I see one of two possibilities.



1. Hasbro accidentally produced too many of this mold and are trying desperately to get rid of them any way they can.



2. They decided that simply repainting a G1 themed figure was too expensive and decided to see just how stuck in a rut Geewunners are by trying to release the same beloved character in multiple packages designed to make you think it is something different....you know like a repaint but without the repaint. Hell it isn't even a different character like the Seekers are. They just repackaged him. Now they sit back and watch and the Geewunners in their clamoring for anything G1-related beat each other up to find the different packaging while Hasbro execs sit on the pile of money they conned them out of. It's like releasing a new G1-themed character without having to do any retool or redesign but counting on the name WHEELJACK and Geewunners to make money without any effort on their part.

Yeah on occasion. It's as if new stock came in but they still are trying to get rid of the old stock at the same time and it's the same guy. I think the stockers just assume there is something different in the figures. Yeah on occasion.

There haven't been so many Wheeljack figures near my realm. Here's a snapshot of what my minions have been seeing at least in the Walmarts they trawl at my command:



A whole mess of 'vintage' Beast Wars figures: Optimus Primals Scorponoks Tigatrons.

Some straggling Kingdom figures: Tigatron a lot of unsold Wave 2 deluxes (Huffer Arcee Airazor) about 10 copies of Beast Megatron that nobody seems to want a few Core figures.

Some Studio Series figures: Mostly 4-5 copies of Sweep a couple Hot Rods mostly unsold copies of Blurr and Kup. A large clutch of the new SS Core figures all Ravage and Shockwave.

A few figures from Cyberverse but mostly just the larger Optimus figures that haven't sold and a few copies of Warrior Starscream and a couple Arcees.



No Legacy figures have turned up yet at all and they haven't seen any of these multiple Wheeljack figures. Posted by DeathReviews on April 4th 2022 @ 1:06pm CDT

I scored Silverstreak this afternoon about an hour ago...

4 on the pegs which was kind of nice because I snagged the one with the best paint apps.

As I just said in the Toy Haul thread I feel like if I'm finding these in KCMO they are probably just about everywhere now. Posted by Sowndwave76 on April 4th 2022 @ 4:49pm CDT

Hasbro might not buy back stock of Transformers but they had to buy GI Joes back from Walmart after ROC because the figures didn't sell if they didn't Walmart was going to drop GI Joe if not all of Hasbro's lines at retail.



I don't think re-releasing one-steps have to do with the characters but keeping the bucks/molds in circulation. I'd like to think I have a fairly robust collection of one-step figures and one thing I can tell you is the same basic molds/bucks get used over and over remember those butterfly knife transformation figures? Wheeljack is a new mold that I'm surprised hasn't been reused yet Hasbro is probably re-releasing the figure to squeeze what they can out of the tooling.

I think someone already posited this in a different thread when the Legacy Wheeljack repack first came up (otherwise I read it somewhere else and don't remember where) but I think/agree with the theory that the sudden influx in Wheeljacks may have had something to do with the fact that there was supposed to be a movie releasing this year with Wheeljack as a primary cast member and they may have been banking on the name recognition from the movie helping to sell non-movie Jackies or just wanted brand synergy (plus the BB packaging has art of Arcee and Mirage on it now for seemingly no reason who are ALSO supposed to be in that movie).



Also in terms of reusing molds/keeping molds in circulation though there is supposed to be Shattered Glass Wheeljack this year and every SG figure that came out last year also had that mold used/reused elsewhere that year so maybe there's some correlation there with the Legacy one?

And yet I can't find that Earthrise Wheeljack mold anywhere it's completely sold out at every retailer I visit and I hear similarly from others like Death reviews above. So while this is all anecdotal evidence I still never saw people post pics of Earthrise Wheeljacks shelfwarming even though that toy keeps being reissued.

I mean I doubt they would reissue something that doesn't sell. If they're releasing him again in legacy that probably means he sold a lot in kingdom. He might eventually shelfwarm if they keep reissuing him and don't get the data pointing to every kid and fan already having him on time but that's just a common logistics problem.

The in hand images come to us from Chefatron who uploaded a review to Youtube.

























































































Transformers Beast Wars Terrorsaur (Terrorsaurer) Gallery We knew we'd get another exclusive Terrorsaur in the Buzzworthy line so a second chance to get an exclusive mold of a main Beast Wars season 1 character. Now we have our first look at him. He is a toy redeco and a very well done one at that as you can see below. While he will be a Target exclusive in the US him being part of the Buzzworthy line is a good sign since that line is well stocked at Targets and while toys do eventually sell out there is usually enough stock to meet demand. We are also getting a BW Dinobot redeco in this line. All Buzzworthy toys have also been released in decent numbers in Canadian Toysrus stores so far. We have a link to the original toy's gallery at the end for you to compare.The in hand images come to us from Chefatron who uploaded a review to Youtube.

Batman at my local Target had two endcap a center aisle display and more stuff in the collectables section and still spilled into the Transformers section. I haven't found Silverstreak yet (got him online) and the one time I found Kup I bought him. In my area are Origins Bumblebee and Cliffjumper seem to be the easiest to find of the Deluxes probably because of their sizes.

Some of it anyway. (There are some characters showing up later that we really hope get toys also!) And there was no way a character as toyetic as Moon Knight wouldn’t get action figures galore. Marvel officially revealed the first of Hasbro‘s Marvel Legends Moon Knight figures in a Marvel Must-Haves feature. However on a separate now-removed page they also gave us a glimpse at the figure for his other form Mr. Knight. Both should appear in the Infinite Ultron build-a-figure wave which also includes Hawkeye Kate Bishop and three other figures as yet unnamed. Khonshu would make a great addition though.

Hot Toys of course always goes all-out and delivers the kind of soft-goods cape Hasbro will not deliver. It looks like theirs will even feature light-up eyes but we’ll have to wait and see on the details.

One interesting detail based on the images revealed: an Oscar Isaac unmaksed portrait doesn’t seem included with either figure. Hot Toys sometimes adds an actor likeness later on but the Marvel Legends figure shows only a moon dagger as an accessory. Maybe a Poe Dameron head might work on the same peg though Hasbro hasn’t made him since the advent of their photoreal digital coloring.

Take a look through the gallery below for details. Then tell us which one you like best in comments.

Spend your days touring world-famous art museums and strolling along historic city streets and your nights sailing down the river during WaterFire or taking in a show at the Providence Performing Arts Center. Even if you're short on time in this vibrant capital there's something for everyone to enjoy. Here's how to make the most of your time there.

01 of 12 See a Show at One of Providence's Historic Theatres Providence Performing Arts Center Providence Performing Arts Center first opened as a movie palace in 1928 and now is a popular venue featuring everything from comedy shows and concerts to Broadway musicals like ""Wicked"" ""Hamilton"" ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""Jersey Boys"" among others. 20 national Broadway tours have launched in this impossibly beautiful theater listed on the National Register of Historic Places today despite nearly being destroyed by two horrific hurricanes in 1938 and 1954. Following a rough patch in the 1970s when it mainly served as a concert venue and fell into disrepair it was revamped in the 1980s and is now better than ever. Nearby the Trinity Repertoire Company makes its home in the Lederer Theater Center which used to be the Emery Majestic Theater a major center for vaudeville back in the day. It's currently made up of the Elizabeth and Malcolm Chace Theater and the Sara and Joseph Dowling Jr. Theater offering a mix of stage plays and musicals meant to entertain and thrill guests of all ages.

Upon investigation it was determined that the juvenile had received the burns after a gasoline container that he/she threw into the fire had exploded.

Though the juvenile received multiple burns none were life-threatening and in an abundance of caution he/she was transported to Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence to be further evaluated.

According to Dartmouth Chief of Police Brian P. LEVESQUE “We are all very relieved that the incident did not turn out much worse and we certainly hope that others can learn from this dire error in judgment. Should anyone have questions about campfire safety I along with my public safety partners would encourage them to either contact their local fire department or find information from credible online sources.

To protect the identity of the juvenile neither their name nor their address will be disclosed.”-Dartmouth Police Department."

Statins are a group of commonly prescribed medicines that help reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This type of cholesterol is often branded the “bad” cholesterol because it clings to the inside of your artery walls thereby raising your risk of a serious cardiovascular event. Any intervention that prevents this process is to be welcomed but statins can pose hidden health risks.

The decision to take statins should not be taken lightly because there are a number of important health considerations. According to Doctor Afzal Sohaib consultant cardiologist at The Wellington Hospital part of HCA Healthcare UK stopping statins ""completely"" can be ""dangerous"". Doctor Sohaib said: ""In most cases statins will be taken for life as coming off statins completely is known to significantly increase the risk of an individual experiencing another cardiovascular event."" How? ""While the effects may not be immediate stopping statins can cause cholesterol levels to return to a high level very quickly.""

READ MORE Statins side effects: Drug can cause thrombocytopenia - signs What the research says Mounting evidence illustrates the risks associated with coming off statins completely. Research published last year in JAMA Network Open linked withdrawal from statins to a higher risk of hospital admission for serious cardiovascular problems and mortality. In a large study researchers reported that withdrawal of statins from elderly people receiving a variety of other drugs was linked to a higher risk of hospital admission for heart failure and any cardiovascular outcome as well as death from any cause. The research published online June 14 in JAMA Network Open examined almost 30000 patients 65 years of age and older on multiple medications often referred to as ""polypharmacy"" who were receiving treatment with statins as well as blood pressure-lowering antidiabetic and antiplatelet agents.

Discontinuing statins was associated with a significantly increased risk of hospital admission for heart failure of about 24 percent other cardiovascular outcomes by 14 percent and death from any cause by 15 percent.

He continued: ""Older patients have a higher absolute risk of dying and withdrawing proven therapy shown to reduce risk of coronary/stroke events in randomised controlled trials would be expected to result in more cardiovascular events.""

Strong holiday demand and price increases delivered sales and profit growth while hikes in sugar dairy packaging labor and shipping costs weighed on margins.

The strong fourth quarter capped a year of double-digit sales and earnings growth for Hershey. Net income in the fiscal year ended Dec. 31 2021 was $1.48 billion equal to $7.34 per share on the common stock up 16% from $1.28 billion or $6.30 per share in fiscal 2020. Sales totaled $8.97 billion up 10% from $8.15 billion in fiscal 2020.

Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 was $336 million or $1.67 per share up from $291 million or $1.44 per share in the same period a year ago. Sales for the quarter were $2.33 billion up from $2.19 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Reflecting how the company has approached acquisitions and product growth in recent years Hershey is recasting how it reports its financial results. Historically it offered two reportable segments North America and International/Other. Moving forward the company will divide its North America business into two segments: North America Confectionery and North America Salty Snacks.

The North America Confectionery segment includes chocolate and nonchocolate confectionery gum and refreshment products protein bars spreads snack bites and mixes as well as pantry and foodservice lines while the North America Salty Snacks segment includes ready-to-eat popcorn baked and trans-fat free snacks pretzels and other snacks.

For the 12 months ended Dec. 31 operating income in the North America Confectionery segment rose 8.8% to $2.48 billion from $2.27 billion in fiscal 2020. Sales increased 8.5% to $7.68 billion from $7.08 billion. Operating income for the North America Salty Snacks segment was $101 million up 33% from $76 million in 2020. Sales increased 27% to $555 million from $438 million.

Pricing remains the main lever driving growth across both segments as the company struggles to keep pace with consumer demand.

“Consumers spending more time at home has clearly benefited some of our brands and categories because they're around their homes more to consume our products and our products are more eaten in those types of environments” said Michele G. Buck president and chief executive officer of The Hershey Co. during a Feb. 3 conference call with analysts.

Hershey has focused on optimizing demand getting the most out of existing capacity by reducing complexity and changeovers and prioritizing high velocity stock-keeping units. The company also has invested in new manufacturing lines added a new distribution center and expanded its labor force.

Still executives at the company expect capacity constraints will continue in the year ahead.

“Today we don’t have enough capacity to meet all consumer demand” said Steven E. Voskuil senior vice president and chief financial officer at Hershey. “We’ve had four manufacturing lines come online in 2021. We have more in Reese’s Payday and Jolly Rancher gummies that will come online in 2022 but even with that we feel like we’re behind.”

The company plans to invest between $550 million and $600 million in the year ahead including in labor and supply chain capacity. Those investments partially will be offset by list price increases across all segments in fiscal 2022. While Hershey has successfully executed price increases in the past Ms. Buck told analysts the company will keep a close eye on the impact of broad inflation on consumers. Other potential headwinds include reductions in government stimulus and SNAP benefits.

“We think historical price elasticity is a smart and prudent planning move for us” she said. “We’re not a category where there’s a big private label component and people can easily say ‘I’m going to still participate but switch to lower brands.’ That’s always been a benefit for us during times like this but we do understand the pressure consumers are under.”

Hershey forecast full-year 2022 sales growth between 8% and 10%. The company expects full-year adjusted earnings per share growth of 9% to 11%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qdXN0amFyZWQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMDIvYmVuLXN0aWxsZXItcmVjYWxscy10aGUtZW1iYXJyYXNzaW5nLW1pc3Rha2UtaGUtbWFkZS13aGlsZS13b3JraW5nLW9uLXN0ZXZlbi1zcGllbGJlcmdzLWVtcGlyZS1vZi10aGUtc3VuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ben Stiller Recalls the Embarrassing Mistake He Made While Working on Steven Spielberg's 'Empire of the Sun',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.justjared.com/2022/04/02/ben-stiller-recalls-the-embarrassing-mistake-he-made-while-working-on-steven-spielbergs-empire-of-the-sun/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qdXN0amFyZWQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMDIvYmVuLXN0aWxsZXItcmVjYWxscy10aGUtZW1iYXJyYXNzaW5nLW1pc3Rha2UtaGUtbWFkZS13aGlsZS13b3JraW5nLW9uLXN0ZXZlbi1zcGllbGJlcmdzLWVtcGlyZS1vZi10aGUtc3VuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbm5saXZlLmNvbS9nYWxsZXJpZXMvVzNDSzY0UTRSWkZBM04ySlc0QVVRUVlEUDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hersheypark Springtime in the Park - pennlive.com,"35 / 36

The permit will allow Exxon to begin construction and operation of its Yellowtail project the latest of up to 10 expected to be producing oil this decade. A final decision by Exxon on funding the project is pending.

An Exxon spokesperson confirmed the approval.

Since Exxon and partners Hess Corp and CNOOC Ltd started exploring off the coast of the Guyana in 2015 they have found more than 10 billion barrels of oil and gas.

Yellowtail was the consortium's 13th discovery in the Stabroek block an area covering 6.6 million acres (26800 square kilometers) and one of the largest oil finds in South America.

When output begins in 2025 the project would pump up to 250000 barrels of oil and gas per day the company has said. Exxon has proposed a development plan for Yellowtail that would require up to three ships drilling up to 67 wells.

The Guyana EPA permit prohibits routine flaring and venting of natural gas during operation and requires Exxon to keep an undersea device called a capping stack that can seal a well in event of an accident according to a statement by the Guyana EPA.

It also required that the partners have insurance to cover any environmental damages and provide a guarantee that indemnifies Guyana in event the consortium fails to meet their obligations the EPA said.

Earlier this year Exxon started up a new floating production storage and offloading vessel that will bring the group's oil production capacity this year to more than 340000 bpd.

The Private Sector Commission (PSC) on Saturday said it was satisfied that the environmental authorisation of the Yellowtail oil production project requires the ExxonMobil-led consortium to have emergency equipment in Guyana to cap a well should there be a blowout at the offshore project.

“The PSC is pleased with the Oil Spill Response and Financial Assurance provision in the permit which requires EEPGL (Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited) to procure a Capping Stack to be maintained tested and stored in Guyana as this will ensure that operators are in a state of readiness to cap any well in the event of a disaster” the PSC said.

Guyana’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explained in announcing the grant of its Environmental Authorisation for Yellowtail that among the notable conditions the Permit requires EEPGL to procure a Capping Stack to be maintained tested and stored in Guyana.” The EPA explained that a capping stack is a large well closure device that connects to the top of the blowout preventer (BOP) and is capable of sealing off a well.

Additionally the EPA said EEPGL must maintain access to at least one overseas subscription service to allow mobilization of a Capping Stack to the project location. This serves to fortify safety and emergency response efforts since wells would be swiftly capped in the event of a well blow-out.

The PSC also expressed satisfaction that that flaring has been incorporated into the Yellowtail permit with specific detail but urged EEPGL to have spare equipment on standby should there be a malfunction and so avoid gaseous pollution. “We would also like to see an effective Contingency Plan put in place (such as having a spare compressor on hand) to address any mechanical failure that may occur in

the future that will limit flaring to the approved limits as specified in the permit” the private sector body said.

The umbrella business organisation also welcomed the undisclosed financial assurance by the ExxonMobil majority-owned EEPGL to fund the damage cleanup and restoration as a result of an oil spill. “Further the Commission appreciates the fact that the Financial Assurance provision holds EEPGL liable for all costs associated with clean up restoration and compensation for any pollution damage which may occur as consequence of the Yellowtail Development Project” the PSC said.

The EPA and EEPGL are expected to ink an agreement to cover the financial assurance by EEPGL after the company provides an estimate of response cleanup restoration and compensation should there be disaster in the Stabroek Block an official said Saturday. EEPGL according to the official was yet to say how much insurance would taken out for the Yellowtail project as each project has to be insured separately.

As far as the financial assurance is concerned ExxonMobil estimates that EEPGL is valued about US$5 billion while their parent companies are in the hundreds of billions of US dollars. The official said EPA hoped to finalise insurance and assurance matters with EEPGL very soon ahead of the commencement of undersea preparatory work for the arrival of another Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel.

The EPA said the Permit also ensures that EEPGL is held liable for all costs associated with clean up restoration and compensation for any pollution damage which may occur as consequence of the project. EEPGL is also required to have Financial Assurance which includes a combination of Insurance which must “cover well control and/or clean up and third-party liability on terms that are market standard for the type of coverage” and a Parent Company/Affiliate Guarantee Agreement which indemnifies and keeps indemnified the EPA and the Government of Guyana in the event EEPGL and its co-Venturers fail to meet their environmental obligations under the Permit. “Further the financial assurance provided must be guided by an estimate of the sum of the reasonably credible costs expenses and liabilities that may arise from any breaches of this permit. Liabilities are considered to include costs associated with responding to an incident clean-up and remediation and monitoring” the EPA added.

In seeking to ensure EEPGL meets its obligations to prevent and mitigate environmental harm the Permit imposes comprehensive requirements for monitoring and management of any impacts affecting biological physical and socio-economic resources within the Area of Influence of the project including targeted and updated environmental baseline studies. The Permit also requires EEPGL to submit safety case information including a risk assessment prior to drilling and development of wells according to the EPA.

The Yellowtail Development will be located 203 kilometres north-east off the coast of Georgetown Guyana to a water depth in the project area ranging from 1700 metres to 1900 metres.

In 2020 there were more than 10000 reported cases of human trafficking in the U.S. with 72% of those related to sex trafficking according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline. Hotels and motels are among the most common venues for sex trafficking due to easy access willingness to accept cash and lack of facility maintenance.

The Covid-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the issue as criminals abuse new hotel technology like contactless check-in which makes it more difficult to spot signs of trafficking. Meanwhile sex trafficking lawsuits continue to pile up against hotel chains.

A law passed in 2000 to criminalize trafficking penalizes private entities that enable or are complicit with the illegal act. Since then major hotel brands as well as smaller motels have been sued for negligence profiting from and promoting sex trafficking.

Hotels such as Marriott Hilton and Hyatt have implemented their own human trafficking training requirements for employees. Hotel staff are asked to look for warnings signs including paying with cash toting few personal items and refusing cleaning service for multiple days.

Most hotels and motels agree they have a responsibility to detect monitor and report potential trafficking.

An opening date has been set and the hotel is now accepting reservations.

Basics of the new Hilton Maldives Amingiri

The new 109-villa Hilton Maldives Aminigiri Resort & Spa has started accepting reservations for stays as of September 1 2022. This complements the three existing Hilton-family properties in the Maldives (including a Waldorf Astoria Conrad and Curio Collection).

Hilton Maldives reception

The Hilton will be located on Amingiri Island in the Male Atoll (which immediately made me think of Amangiri the Aman resort in Utah) just a 20-minute speedboat ride from Velana International Airport (MLE). There are pros and cons to that:

It’s super convenient to just be able to take a quick speedboat transfer to your resort rather than having to take a seaplane

At the same time proximity to Male usually means that an island is less beautiful less untouched and less secluded and those are largely things that people come to the Maldives to experience

The Hilton’s 109 villas will either be on the beach or overwater and each will feature a private pool.

As you’d expect the hotel will also have a shared pool spa salon and fitness center as well as six restaurants and bars. Dining options will include an all-day dining restaurant serving international cuisine as well as an adults-only bar specializing in champagne and gin-based drinks.

The resort will even have a teens-only zone which some parents may appreciate since not all properties in the Maldives are particularly teen-friendly.

Hilton Maldives Amingiri rates & points requirements

If you’re looking to redeem points the Hilton Maldives is currently charging 110000 Hilton Honors points per night and Hilton Honors elite members can get a fifth night free (so you’re potentially paying an average of just 88000 points per night). Hilton Honors free night awards can also be redeemed here.

Entry level rooms here are one bedroom overwater pool villas. They have 1657 square feet (presumably including outdoor space) and feature direct access to the ocean from the deck.

As far as cash rates go in the low season rates start at well over $800 per night and in peak season rates start at $1150+ per night. I’d expect that rates could change quite a bit over time as hotels often aren’t realistic with pre-opening pricing.

The Maldives has a lot of points properties…

On the one hand I guess more hotel options is a good thing for consumers. On the other hand at this point the Maldives has so many hotels (including ones bookable with points) that I can’t even keep track of them.

Going back several years there were a couple of points hotels in the Maldives. There was a certain novelty to traveling there since it was hard to get to this paradise there weren’t that many properties and actually finding availability with points was challenging. But now there are simply so many properties and most of the major hotel groups have multiple hotels to choose from.

Is the Hilton as such something to get excited about? I have a few initial thoughts:

For a “standard” Hilton this property looks gorgeous; I’m curious if it’s as nice in real life as in the renderings

Many people will appreciate that every room here has a private pool which isn’t the case at many Maldives properties

People will either love or hate that this is just a 20-minute speedboat ride from the international airport; that’s really convenient but will also mean that the resort won’t be as pristine and secluded as some of the properties that are more of a trek to get to

While there are more luxurious brands in the Maldives where you can redeem points (Ritz-Carlton St. Regis Waldorf Astoria etc.) one benefit of staying at a less luxurious brand is that I’d expect prices on property to be cheaper for everything from food and drinks to spa treatments to transfers

Bottom line

The Hilton Maldives Amingiri is accepting reservations for stays as of September 2022 and it will be the fourth Hilton-family property in the Maldives. The property will be just a 20-minute speedboat ride from the airport so that will be convenient.

Anyone considering staying at the new Hilton Maldives?

It was Swiatek's 17th straight win and her third consecutive title.

On Monday Swiatek will officially ascend to the World No.1 for the first time in her career. She moves to that position following her commanding 1-hour and 17-minute victory.

""I just feel really satisfied and fulfilled and also proud of myself"" Swiatek said in her post-match press conference. ""I feel like I have got to celebrate because I don't know how long I can keep up with this streak.""

Sunshine Double complete: Swiatek also joins an exclusive club by becoming only the fourth woman to win the Sunshine Double — titles at WTA 1000 Indian Wells and Miami in the same season.

Stefanie Graf (1994 and 1996) Kim Clijsters (2005) and Victoria Azarenka (2016) all former No.1 players are the others. Swiatek 20 is the youngest woman to pull off this accomplishment.

""I feel pretty privileged that I can be amongst those players because I wouldn't even dream of it a few years ago"" Swiatek said. ""I knew it's going to be tough playing these two tournaments in a row. I realized at the end it's just another match and I took it step by step.""

Miami Final Highlights: Swiatek defeats Osaka to win 17th straight match

Owning the WTA 1000s: Swiatek's career-best winning streak continues with all of her past 17 wins coming at the first three WTA 1000 events of the season.

Swiatek swept the titles at WTA 1000 Doha Indian Wells and now Miami joining Serena Williams (2013 – Miami Madrid Rome Toronto) and Caroline Wozniacki (2010 – Montréal Tokyo Beijing) as the only players to win three or more consecutive WTA 1000 titles in a single season.

But Swiatek stands alone as the first player to win the first three WTA 1000 tournaments in a season. It was her fourth career WTA 1000 title and the sixth singles title overall.

WTA

Swiatek becomes the first player to win 17 consecutive matches on hard courts in a single calendar year since Williams won 20 straight between the Australian Open and Toronto in 2015.

""I learned a lot about myself that I can keep going and really I don't need to feel like 100 percent on points to win matches against great players"" Swiatek said. ""I can trust myself a little bit more right now. I really used that streak to have more confidence and also the ranking.""

Match moments: A tricky 10-minute game started proceedings with Osaka saving two break points and withstanding seven deuces before holding. A handful of close games followed before Swiatek won the first break of the day with a backhand crosscourt winner to lead 3-2.

That would prove to be the deciding moment. Swiatek marched to the one-set lead despite Osaka's bold returning tactics from deep inside the court. Swiatek kept the momentum as the second set began breaking Osaka right away with aggressive returns of her own.

All told Swiatek reeled off the last seven games of the match to extend her stunning winning streak. Swiatek never faced a break point and prevailed on exactly two-thirds of Osaka’s second-service points (20 for 30).

""Playing against Naomi in a final was pretty exciting and I knew that the world is going to watch because it's a nice match just to follow"" Swiatek said. ""I wanted to give the best tennis I can so people actually can be satisfied. But on the other hand just seeing that I can play that well against such a player is really satisfying.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Toast of Port Jeff is moving to a new location this spring. Click here to learn more.

The Coram Middle Island and Gordon Heights communities are taking spring cleaning to a whole new level this weekend.

The corner of Route 25 and Route 112 in Coram is a major hub for Suffolk County transportation but home to a bus stop that has been blighted for some time.

Panhandling drug dealing crime and other issues are growing around this specific bus stop CBS News reports and local volunteers feel it is time for a change.

Three civic groups — the Middle Island Civic Association the Gordon Heights Civic Association and the Coram Civic Association — are joining forces on April 2 in a community-wide clean-up as part of their new initiative “Taking Back Route 25.”

“Route 25 connects us all and all of us are vested in making things better for our communities because we have overlapping problems that impact us all” said James Freeman president of the Gordon Heights Civic Association.

Several other groups are also sponsoring the event including the Gordon Heights Chamber of Commerce Suffolk PBA Legislator Dominick Thorne Councilman Mike Loguerico the Coram Gordon Heights and Middle Island Fire Departments and others.

Volunteers will meet around 9:30 a.m. at the Coram Home Depot Parking Lot (346 Middle Country Rd).

Freeman told CBS News the plan is to start the mass cleanup at Middle Country Road and Route 112 and head east.

The Gordon Heights Civic Association’s overall mission this year is “rebuilding both intellectually and financially” which includes making improvements to the community’s parks transportation living conditions and more.

“All of us have an obligation as human beings to help the people that need it most as best we can” Freeman said.

Firefighters said they received a call at 7:45 p.m. about large fire on Myrtle Avenue.

Neighbors told News 12 Long Island that the fire seemed to have started in the rear of house and then quickly spread.

About 125 firefighters from multiple departments responded. Officials said fire crews performed an interior attack of the building and got most of the fire under control when they found the victim inside the house.

West Islip Fire Department Assistant Chief Robert Celeste said there was heavy fire in front and along the side of the house when crews arrived.

Celeste said teams searched aggressively for the victim upon hearing reports of an occupant inside.

Upon finding the victim Celeste said firefighters then put out the fire entirely and then turned the scene over to Suffolk police and the homicide squad.

The cause of the fire is unknown.

Indeed most stores across my region appear to have inventory (SKU 1007492425)…and I walked away with a brand-spanking-new smartcam.

What’s new and notable is Wyze has once again repurposed their somewhat amazing ‘Starlight’ sensor found in the Wyze Cam v3 that brings unnatural color night vision to Wyze’s only battery-powered camera. Based on the Home Depot listing and product box shot most else appears the same – the weather-resistant Wyze Outdoor Cam retains its magnetic mount Death Star appearance and (yet another) network bridge. Although the possibility exists for a slightly increased field of view (130 vs 110?) and who knows maybe we’ll see some improved battery performance. I expect to learn more once I get mine going and after a few days of usage.

The Wyze Cam Outdoor v2 camera lands at the same $80 Home Depot price point as the original model released in 2020. Although Wyze pricing is highly variable – dependent upon merchant shipping fees and phases of the moon. Further for anything close to ‘real’ security cam functionality prospective owners should also be prepared to pay $15/yr for Cam Plus. Although Wyze is currently in the penalty box for some having betrayed our trust with a sluggish security response and associated poor communication."

He’s a part of the team behind our UpCycle process technology. Relative to conventional incineration and landfilling UpCycle technology could result in 90% of waste plastics being recycled when combined with mechanical and other chemical recycling approaches and improved collection and sorting.

With the technology plastic waste unsuitable for mechanical recycling is broken down into a recycled polymer feedstock which can then be used to manufacture new high-quality plastics. This differs from mechanical recycling which simply melts down and reshapes plastic.

In light of innovations like UpCycle that have potential to expand packaging and waste plastic circularity Anderle said he believes recycling is something that all consumers can be a part of and should take an interest in.

Here’s how to improve your recycling habits on a personal level.

Learn your local recycling guidelines

Start with your local household waste collectors since guidelines can vary based on city and country.

Anderle said that most waste collection companies have lists online that detail what types of plastics or other materials can go in your at-home recycling bins.

“The list of what can’t go in recycling is also important” Anderle said. “There could be some surprising things on the ‘do not add’ list.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvYXByLzAyL2hhdmUtcGF0aWVuY2UtdGhpcmQtd29ybGQtc3RyZXRjaC1vZi1rYW5pcy1yb2FkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OPINION | DRIVETIME MAHATMA: Paving job will rejoin free world | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"



Dear Mahatma: Why is the paving of Kanis Road between Lowe's and Gamble Road worse than in Third World countries? -- Joe

Dear Joe: Thanks for the trip down Cold War Memory Lane.

Back in that day there were three worlds -- the Free World the Communist World and the Third World. The latter was generally thought of as developing countries in Latin America Asia and Africa that were aligned with neither the free nor Communist worlds.

What's old is new again. But never mind Ukraine. Let's concentrate on the road question from which we get an answer from Jon Honeywell the city's Public Works chief.

Honeywell's staff is well aware of the unsatisfactory conditions of this pave job he said. Asphalt pavement specifications have not been met.

The staff is documenting pavement conditions to determine what corrective actions the general contractor must do. Once those corrections are complete the city will again review the finished pavement.

Oh and Honeywell appreciates the public's patience during this process.

Nice alliteration for sure.

Dear Mahatma: The new left-turn lane at Rahling Road and Chenal Parkway has been orange-coned for weeks months years -- the usable lane with the left arrow gets backed up-- so then the straight arrow laners become left turners. Very dangerous. What could possibly be the delay? Landscaping? A reminder from the one and only Mahatma? -- Straight Arrow

Dear Arrow: City spokesman Spencer Watson secured an explanation from Public Works.

The traffic cones are there because installation of the additional signal heads for the dual left turns has been delayed. The city hopes to have the signal completed soon or lanes will be reopened to their previous configuration if equipment delays continue for a prolonged period.

Dear Mahatma: It appears the Kanis Road widening project is winding down. Surely there is fine-tuning to be done. At the northeast corner of Kanis and Bowman Road the west-bound outside lane is blocked by lines but is still used for right turns. At the intersection of Kanis and Cherry Brook Drive the new road zigs without a corresponding zag. Sidewalks are misaligned in several locations. It looks like something I would have designed. -- David in LR

Dear David: City spokesman Spencer Watson secured an explanation from Public Works. Again.

These matters will be resolved in an upcoming project on which bids are scheduled to be opened this month with construction anticipated to begin this summer.

The Bowman/Kanis improvements will reconstruct and widen Bowman from Cherry Laurel Drive to Kanis and Kanis from east of the Bowman intersection to Cherry Brook Drive. Reconstruction of the Bowman/Kanis intersection with related turn lanes and new signals is included in the project.

Vanity plate on a Pontiac G8: EXTINCT. Surely this refers to the demise of Pontiac in 2009 killed by General Motors as it went into bankruptcy. The GT model had a 6.0 liter V-8 generating 361 horsepower. This is a desirable muscle car for old coots. Like us. Fabulous Babes are less impressed.

Rausch at Osheim & Schmidt Funeral Home,"Our Savior Jesus Christ has destroyed death and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel. Let us remember with thanksgiving what God has done through his servant Scott Rausch.

Scott E. Rausch son of Jesse and Dorothy Rausch was born in Pierre SD on January 3 1953 he was baptized in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost on May 10 1953. He confessed his baptismal faith through confirmation on April 23 1967 and was admitted to the altar to receive the medicine of immortality Christ’s life-giving body and blood. Scott was joined together in holy matrimony to Linda Ganske on December 27 1975. On April 2 2022 Scott at the age of 69 years fell asleep in Jesus. He is survived by his wife Linda his mother Dorothy and his sister Jody and many loving cousins nieces and nephews and friends. He was predeceased by his father Jesse and his maternal and paternal grandparents.

Scott was raised on the family farm in Potter County close to many cousins. They all attended Artichoke elementary which they rode their motorcycles to even though they were a little young. They honored their country and state through the Young Citizens League. Scott learned piano and continued to play and sing the state song. Scott received his Amateur Radio License with his dad and has remained a lifelong ham radio operator. He put up antennas in many places some allowed by the HOA. He graduated from Gettysburg High School in 1971.

Scott attended South Dakota School of Mines graduating with a degree in Electrical Engineering in 1975. Scott was active on campus. Scott was a member of Theta Tau fraternity. Scott served as senior class president at Mines as well as president of many other organizations. He joked that when they held the meeting for student group presidents he wanted to be the only one there but still have perfect attendance. He was in ROTC and later commissioned as a lieutenant in the US Army. He married Linda 6 months later.

Scott did his basic training at Ft. Lewis in Washington State. He said it rained all the time. He served three months in the Corps of Engineers at Ft. Belvoir in Arlington VA. He served the rest of his time in the reserves. He went away two weeks every summer. He couldn’t tell me where or what they were doing but the government sent a check so I think it was legitimate. He achieved the top rank of major.

After college Scott and Linda worked for Union Carbide. Together they installed the first digitally controlled operation in the Cellosize Unit. Scott was the project manager for the controls installation and start up. Linda was the production manager. After two years they moved to Iowa where Scott worked for Rockwell Collins. At first he worked on CAPS a computer design. He then went into the Avionics field starting in control systems for business aircraft. This involved world travel to all of the business aircraft manufacturers. He went on a few test flights but thought he would like to spend more time on the ground. At this point got licensed as a pilot and became the impoverished owner of a Grumman Tiger. After three or four engine failures and landing without power Scott gave up his license.

After nine Years at Rockwell Scott moved on to other Avionics companies including Sperry Honeywell Loral etc. He was proud to be the project leader for Honeywell installing the complete Avionics system in the Boeing 777. After projects were complete Scott was usually offered a job at the company that got the next big contract. He worked in Phoenix Cedar Rapids Atlanta San Francisco Atlanta and Kansas City. Sometimes Linda was in the same city but sometimes not. This made for many weekend trips to unusual midway points for visits not always a tourist destination but we saw a lot of the USA.

Tired of moving all the time Scott and Linda retired and returned to their beloved Black Hills in 2001. They built a house on land which they had purchased in 1992. Being newly back in the community Scott knew he had to get involved to meet people and boy did he ever get involved. First was being treasurer at Divine Shepherd Lutheran. Then he volunteered to remodel the old fire house in Piedmont to house their first library. Scott loved books and became very involved with the South Dakota Book Festival. This led to two gubernatorial appointments to The South Dakota Humanities Council. He served as treasurer there as well teaching the liberal bookies the reality of paying for things. Scott was also a Board Member of the Rapid City Arts Council and Dahl Fine Arts.

About 2007 Dr. Larry Simonsen asked Scott to help out at the School of Mines teaching a course or two. This was attractive to Scott. He taught most of the general EE courses. After the Power System professor left Scott became the “Power Guy” teaching all of the power classes. This led to many power plant visits and stops on the highway to look at transmission lines. Eventually the EE Department Head left and Scott became the Acting Department Head for several years. He was probably the only University Department Head ever who only had a bachelor’s degree. According to Dr. Simonsen Scott was the best department head ever. At the time of his death Scott was teaching the second semester of the new Avionics Minor offered for the first time. Dr. Rankin SDSM&T President and fellow avionics guys and fraternity brothers were helpful in establishing this course of study. In 2017 Scott received the Ennenga Award for Excellence in Teaching and in 2018 Scott was awarded the University’s highest honor for alumni the March Medal. He was a tireless mentor for the students and a highly respected colleague.

Scott was a life-long ham radio operator and still called the SD net on Saturday nights and Sunday Mornings. This did impact my social life. He his father and sister were all members of the Quarter Century Wireless Association for folks who have been hams for more than 25 years. He was a member and past president of the Black Hills Amateur Radio Club. When people were stressed or bored Scott would say they should work to increase their code speed. This silent key will be missed.

Over the years Scott was active in the Lions Optimist and Toastmasters clubs. Scott earned his black belt in Taekwondo.

Scott loved animals and was a dedicated caretaker for Linda’s horses. He saved turtles crossing the road and threw out grain for the turkeys and deer. He loved dogs but we were always too busy to have one. We were honored to pet-sit several of our friends’ dogs. He didn’t really like cats but one day he saved a kitten who was lost by our barn. We had Barney for about 3 months before we found him a good home. Scott was teaching Sunday School and his class was doing a lesson on God and the animals. Scott became a vegetarian after that lesson.

Scott loved books. He built a very large library at home. Most of them were carried up-stairs one at a time but when we moved in it was 90 book boxes at a time. The only non-fiction allowed had to be a classic. Many books on philosophy religion theology science and engineering.

Scott loved his family and friends and was there for them always.

The Lord gives and the Lord takes away: blessed be the name of the Lord. We give thanks to God our Father through Christ Jesus our Lord for our brother Scott Rausch.

Visitation will be from 5:00-7:00 p.m. with at 6:00 p.m. prayer service on Thursday April 7 2022 at Osheim & Schmidt Funeral Home.

Funeral Services will be at 10:00 a.m. on Friday April 8. 2022 at Divine Shepherd Lutheran Church in Black Hawk.

Hormel Foods the company primarily known for Spam and other cured smoked and deli meats said Thursday that it's buying Skippy the country's No. 2 peanut butter brand for about $700 million. (AP/Austin Daily Herald Eric Johnson)

Hormel is recalling about 60000 jars of Skippy peanut butter over concerns that a ""limited number"" could contain stainless steel fragments from an errant piece of manufacturing equipment the food processing giant announced.

The affected products include Skippy's reduced fat creamy peanut butter reduced fat chunky peanut butter and creamy peanut butter blended with plant protein. All products were marked best if used by May 2023 Hormel said.

Shipments that were possibly affected were sent to: California Connecticut Delaware Florida Hawaii Illinois Indiana Kansas Massachusetts Minnesota Missouri North Carolina Nebraska New Hampshire New Jersey New York Oklahoma and Wisconsin.

No consumers have complained about the issue Hormel told The Washington Post and all retailers that received the products have been notified.

The company said in a news release that the facility's internal detection systems flagged the problem and that it is issuing the recall ""out of an abundance of caution and with an emphasis on the quality of its products.""

If you think you may have purchased one of these products you can return it to store from which it was purchased or call Skippy Foods consumer engagement at 1-866-475-4779 or visit its website: www.peanutbutter.com for a step-by-step guide.

Minnesota-based Hormel is more than 130 years old developing the world's first canned ham and the iconic SPAM a staple for troops in World War II. It now boasts more than 50 brands sold globally from Planters to Herdez.

Hormel acquired Skippy in 2013 for about $700 million in a bid to expand its business to protein that was not meat. More than 90 million jars of Skippy peanut butter are produced annually according to Hormel's website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vc2tpcHB5LXJlY2FsbGluZy0xNjItMDAwLXBvdW5kcy0wNDEzMTE3NDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Skippy Is Recalling 162000 Pounds Of Reduced-Fat Peanut Butter,"Skippy Foods is recalling nearly 162000 pounds of reduced-fat peanut butter because of concerns that stainless steel fragments may have contaminated a “limited number of jars” it said in a statement.

The fragments are from a “piece of manufacturing equipment” the company owned by Hormel Foods said Wednesday.

“Skippy Foods LLC out of an abundance of caution and with an emphasis on the quality of its products is issuing the recall to ensure that consumers are made aware of the issue. The manufacturing facility’s internal detection systems identified the concern” the company added.

Skippy indicated that customers can return the recalled product to their retailer or contact the company.

The products recalled are:

Skippy Reduced Fat Creamy Peanut Butter 40 ounces with “best if used by” dates of May0423 and May0523;

Skippy Reduced Fat Creamy Peanut Butter — Club 2 40-ounce jars with “best if used by” date of May0523;

Costco sells over 106 million of its beloved rotisserie chickens every year but the bird flu outbreak has reached some of the company's chicken houses Forbes reports. In February over 500000 chickens in the Nebraska facilities were killed to try and stop the spread but it is still raging on.

6 Things You'll See at Costco This Year

""The outbreak is in Costco-sponsored chicken houses but the consequences of this outbreak will lead to a lot of economic pain for all the farmers involved including those that have nothing to do with Costco"" a neighboring farmer Yolanda Bailey told Forbes.

Around 25% of the supply of rotisserie chickens for Costco warehouses comes from Nebraska farms. Should these not be able to keep contributing because of infections there could be millions of fewer rotisserie chickens under the heaters at Costco or they could become more expensive. (The warehouse chain has been criticized in the past for its treatment of the birds on its farms leading to some suggesting that Costco raise the $4.99 set price and use the profits to maintain better facility standards.)

Right now even if bird flu cases get under control and drop with the affected farms in a quarantine zone new birds may not be able to be brought into the Nebraska farms for weeks making a rotisserie chicken shortage even more possible at Costco. Eat This Not That! has reached out to the company for more information.

The warehouse chain isn't the only company suffering because of the outbreak. Jennie-O a brand underneath the Hormel Foods umbrella is seeing some of its turkeys and chickens become infected. It emphasizes that there is no immediate public health concern but it could lead to price hikes and/or shortages for things like eggs and meat.",,,,,,

Despite a slight dip in net income the company maintains a strong balance sheet with increased EBITDAre.

Strategic divestitures and a focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels position Host for competitive advantage.

Recent acquisitions signal a forward-looking growth strategy amidst a challenging economic landscape.

On May 3 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands. Despite a slight decrease in net income from $291 million in Q1 2023 to $272 million in Q1 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc demonstrated a 6.5% increase in total revenues reaching $1471 million. Operating profit surged by 17.3% and the operating profit margin under GAAP improved by 180 basis points to 19.8%. Adjusted EBITDAre also saw an 8.8% increase indicating a solid operational performance. The company's strategic divestitures of its interests in European and Asian joint ventures along with other U.S. properties reflect a focused approach to optimizing its portfolio.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

BALANCE SHEET

Net draws of $215 million on the revolving credit facility (including a $300 million draw in March as well as a $65 million draw and $150 million repayment subsequent to quarter end).

This spend is separate from payments for capital expenditures which are considered investing activities.



Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive RevPAR CAGR of 7.7 percent from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. A major leisure destination and the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States Nashville also has a recently expanded airport and a new stadium that is expected to attract more entertainment and sporting events. With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the Property will generate outsized growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders.”

The newly built LEED Silver property opened in 2022 and is located two blocks from numerous live music and entertainment venues in Nashville’s famed Lower Broadway entertainment district. The Property stands directly across from the Music City Convention Center adjacent to the Bridgestone arena home of the NHL Nashville Predators and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum Vanderbilt University Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. The MCCC has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events and it has promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium home of the NFL Tennessee Titans is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium’s dome will allow for year-round activation beginning with the 2027 season. In addition the Nashville International Airport is the fastest growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33 percent above 2019.

Supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville with most projects in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. Host believes the Property is differentiated from the future supply as a result of its central location and diversified product offerings that provide distinct value propositions to customers. The company expects the Property to stabilize between approximately 10-12x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 time frame.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTE1Mzc0NTIwL2hvc3QtaG90ZWxzLWJ1eXMtMS1ob3RlbC1uYXNodmlsbGUtZW1iYXNzeS1zdWl0ZXMtZm9yLTUzMC1taWxsaW9uLWNhc2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Hotels Buys 1 Hotel Nashville Embassy Suites for $530 Million Cash,"Host Hotels & Resorts bought the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for $530 million in an all-cash deal.

The Toyota Corolla GR is ready to burn all the rubber.

Art showing the Toyota Corolla GR shredding its tires in billows of white smoke tell you what this all-new hot hatch is really all about.

(Toyota)

“GR” stands for Gazoo Racing which is the Japanese automaker’s performance/motorsport branch. And according to Road and Track

American buyers have a hankering for a GR-branded rally-inspired hot hatch namely the smaller GR Yaris that’s available in Europe and Mexico.

(Toyota)

Instead we get the Corolla GR loaded up with 300 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque from a turbo-charged 1.6-liter three-cylinder engine that’s only available with a six-speed manual transmission.



It’s also all-wheel drive and if ordered with the Performance Package or as the upgraded Circuit Edition limited-slip differentials front and rear promise to raise the traction limit up higher in the corners.

(Toyota)

It wears Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires wrapped around 18-inch gloss-black 15-spoke cast alloy wheels with ventilated four-piston calipers up front and two-piston calipers in the back which are painted red in the Circuit Edition.

(Toyota)

The Circuit Edition also gets a carbon fiber roof raised hood LED fog lamps and a special spoiler to go along with the standard GR Corolla’s aggressive bumpers flared fenders extra cooling ducts and gloss black exterior accents.

(Toyota)

Rally fans will be pleased to find an e-brake next to the shifter inside along with the signature of Toyota President Akio Toyoda’s racing alias “Morizo.” in the Circuit edition.

That holds as true in Columbus as anywhere else in the nation.

Ahead of the 2022 YWCA Women of Achievement lunch noon on April 27 a diverse panel of of former honorees were convened for Dispatch presents Columbus Conversations: ""How can we empower and advance women in Columbus?""

The panelists were:

Sue Zazon president  Huntington Bank Central Ohio Region

 Huntington Bank Central Ohio Region Dr. Mysheika W. Roberts  Health Commissioner Columbus Public Health

 Health Commissioner Columbus Public Health Janet Jackson  former Columbus city attorney Franklin County Municipal Court judge and president and CEO of the United Way of Central Ohio

 former Columbus city attorney Franklin County Municipal Court judge and president and CEO of the United Way of Central Ohio Barb Smoot  president and CEO of Women for Economic and Leadership Development (WELD)

 president and CEO of Women for Economic and Leadership Development (WELD) Sandra Anderson retired attorney Planned Parenthood board of trustees

The Dispatch is a YWCA Women of Achievement sponsor.

Videos of the discussion can be found here on Dispatch.com or on our Facebook and YouTube pages. Excerpts can be read below. They are edited slightly for clarity.

Hosted by Dispatch Opinion and Community Engagement Editor Amelia Robinson and in association with the Columbus Foundation the Columbus Conversations series seeks solutions to issues of importance to this community.

What's holding Columbus women back and how can those hurdles be overcome?

BARB SMOOT:

""

""If I were all-powerful and I could pick just one thing to fix it would be pay disparity. If you look at studies by Fast Company and others just eliminating the pay gap alone would add over 500 billion to the United States GDP.

""That would have an immediate and favorable impact to everything from healthcare and higher education in middle class criminal justice you name it.

""Even when you factor in higher education that's no longer a solution to the issues that women face when it comes to pay equity it's no longer the equalizer. College women disproportionately share more of the college debt and even the more educated women become the greater the pay disparity.

More:Study reveals that student debt is a potentially crippling liability for college grads

""The second thing that I would pick is eliminate all the hoops and obstacles that women-owned businesses face when they try to get capital to invest in their businesses. They have to prove their abilities in countless ways and go through so many different training programs just to get capital infused into their business. If you look at some of the research done out there on women-owned businesses.

""They ask for less funding for men they get approved at a lower rate. They pay higher interest rates. These stories show that we have some work yet to do.""

SANDRA ANDERSON

""There was a recent study by the Pew Research Center on the gender pay gap which had some very interesting information where we can find some clues on how to close the gap. And it was it focused on younger women.

""For women age 30 and under in certain metropolitan areas not Columbus but in certain metropolitan areas younger women actually make as much as — and sometimes more than — their male counterparts.

""And these are women 30 and under. And those metropolitan areas include New York Los Angeles Washington D.C. but in Columbus younger women ages 30 and younger have a pay gap with their counterparts of about 93 cents on the dollar.

""In Dayton it's only 80 cents on the dollar. So the study analyzed why younger women are doing better in some places and the factors that they identified were at least three: One educational attainment. Second is transparency.

""That means pay audits so we know what everybody else is making. And also there are pay equity laws that enforce pay equity. So transparency is a big factor. And then finally awareness — because the young women are aware of their own value and they ask for what they want and they go into jobs that may be so-called male-dominated jobs and they actually do better.

More:Women still earn 83 cents on the dollar compared with men. Let's fix that.

""The study also showed that after age 30 the wage disparity starts growing again and that's because a number of factors including the ""mommy track"" that women are penalized for being parents passed over for promotions in greater numbers and that disparity compounds over the years.

""Those obstacles and the lessons we learn from some cities where there is pay equity show us that we need to encourage and support lifelong education that we need policies that promote pay equity and transparency and that we need to encourage not just younger women but all women to speak up and ask for what they want and negotiate and take a chance in the higher-paying fields.""

DR. MYSHEIKA W. ROBERTS

""When we think about our girls here in Columbus our girls —particularly our young girls of color — are really having some challenges. Fortunately we had former Councilmember Priscilla Tyson who started the Commission on Black Girls (which) is now housed at Columbus Public Health and we are working hard to make sure that our young Black and brown girls living in our community have the resources they need to be successful.

""We know that our Black and brown girls are more likely to drop out of school. They're more likely to start a family before they might be ready or prepared to do that and they don't have all the resources and training that they need to be able to not only care for themselves but to care for their families.

""Violence is hurting our community and our young women are affected by that so we need to instill them with a sense of confidence a sense of hope for the future because they are our next generation. They are our future and we need to invest in them now and not wait until they get to college age or they’re professional women.

""We need to start investing in them now. Because that is the future of women in Columbus.""

How can Columbus men be better allies to women and girls?

SUE ZAZON

""It's important to recognize specifically in the last couple years that there's a big gap between men and women as far as mental health.

""There was a study done on women in the workforce in 2021 and there is twice the burnout rate of women right now that are in (child)-bearing years or have children than men just because of all the things the pandemic has accentuated so you think about childcare and all of those things.

""From the standpoint of allies one it's just awareness and education that these stresses exist and then the flexibility and foresight to be able to come up with policies —but even just within the policies you can control at your workplace to allow for flexibility and the empowerment of a foundation that’s strong for women to be able to continue to thrive in their chosen career whatever that might be.""

More:'We need positive action:' 49 women ambassadors speak out for equality as part of recovery from pandemic

SANDRA ANDERSON:

""Quit interrupting so much and listen more. Studies show that men interrupt women way too much and they've got to learn to stop that. And we women have to learn to do interruptions ourselves. Madeleine Albright said that we have to learn to interrupt.

""The listening piece is also part of being champions for women mentoring women and not just telling us and mansplaining but actually to listen to what women have to say and to encourage women to have their say.""

How can Columbus women become better allies to each other?

JANET JACKSON

""It is critically important to me personally that we show and demonstrate support for other women. So one of the ways that I do it in my years of so-called retirement is to actually spend time with younger women.

""And when I say younger women I'm usually talking about anywhere from 35 to 50 or 55 to coach and to mentor them.

""And sometimes that coaching and mentoring is how to handle all the women in their workplaces or in the community. Because I've had that experience over many many years of working and being a leader in this community.

""I would look back to my years both as the city attorney and at United Way to demonstrate it in terms of how I personally treated the women who were on my staff.

""If I had a situation where I could see one woman not supporting another woman or other women I would go to that person and have a conversation with her. Many times very challenging and tough decisions but If you're the leader of the organization then it's your responsibility to step in and to nip that in the bud as quickly as you can.""

BARB SMOOT:

""I don't know who said it but they are two of my favorite quotes: 'Strong women support strong women' and 'empowered women empower women.'

""Truly strong women who are confident in what they bring to the table see working with other strong women as excellent opportunities to deliver results and learn new skills.

""And empowered women are not threatened by strong women and they are able to discern when perceived negative behaviors are a really a plea for more empowerment.

Apr 2 2022 (Bloomberg) –First Lady Jill Biden ceremonially commissioned a nuclear-powered submarine on Saturday presiding over a display of U.S. naval power with tension between Washington and Moscow at the highest levels since the depths of the Cold War.

The U.S.S. Delaware commissioned two years ago as the nation’s 18th Virginia-class attack submarine made a port call in President Joe Biden’s hometown of Wilmington Delaware this weekend for a ceremony that was delayed by the pandemic.

The Virginia class is the pillar of the U.S. Navy’s undersea strategy into the second half of the 21st century. The boats can strike underwater and surface targets with torpedoes or attack sea and land-based targets with Tomahawk cruise missiles while remaining on patrol for months. By 2028 the Navy wants to deploy next-generation hypersonic weapons on the subs.

“This latest ship to carry the USS Delaware — the name — is part of a long tradition of serving our nation proudly and strengthening our nation’s security the security of the United States of America — not just us but our allies and partners around the world as well” the president said during the traditional sendoff ceremony for new naval vessels. “In fact it’s already been doing that for some time.”

One of the primary missions of U.S. attack submarines like the Delaware is to hunt down and destroy enemy ballistic missile submarines in the event of war. Russian President Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert last month after invading Ukraine in a show of force toward the U.S. and its allies.

The U.S. didn’t reciprocate choosing not to escalate the hostilities but the Biden administration and other NATO countries have poured weaponry into Ukraine including anti-air and anti-tank missiles to help the Kyiv government fight off the Russian military.

The Navy has had maintenance issues with the $166 billion sub fleet with more than 1600 parts swapped between them since 2013 to ease bottlenecks as components of the boats wear out decades earlier than expected. General Dynamics Corp. and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. are set to build 48 of the subs.

Congress has persistently pushed the Navy to build the subs faster than its current pace of two per year.

Due to Covid-19 restrictions over the past two years the sub was “the first warship to be commissioned beneath the waves” Navy Secretary Carlos del Toro said.

With some 1100 dignitaries and other guests attending the ceremony at the Port of Wilmington the first lady concluded by clearing commanders and sailors to board the sub.

“It was a challenge to put our ship in service in the middle of a global pandemic” she said. “Officers and crew of the USS Delaware man our ship and bring her to life.”

The contract was signed on March 18 this year and the manufacturer of Rumes 300 Huntington Ingalls Industries [HII] announced the news in a press release on March 30.

The contract includes the production and delivery of multiple UUVs training integration into the fleet spare parts for production hardware and engineering support services. BulgariaMilitary.com recalls that two years ago the Pentagon commissioned through the Department of Defense Innovation to develop a similar device that would meet the requirements of the US Navy for next-generation submarine drones.

Huntington Ingalls Industries says that despite the shortened deadlines they have managed to produce the necessary prototypes in these two years and successfully pass all the evaluations. The United States must acquire the first Remus 300 in 2023.

Rumes 300 UUV

The original developer of Remus 300 is the Norwegian company Hydroid which in 2020 was acquired by Huntington Ingalls Industries and thus became a subsidiary of HII. Initially Remus 300 was developed as a civilian commercial product later the military found another application – intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance [ISR].

The US Navy will use Remus 300 for its intended purpose – intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance mine action search and recovery marine archeology hydrographic commissioning anti-submarine warfare and more.

Remus 300 has an integrated unmanned marine autonomous architecture which will allow easier updating or adding new solutions in the future. The drone weighs 56 kg but this is a standard size. Depending on the mission the drone can be reconfigured and change its weight – from 45 to 67 kg. The operational depth to which the drone can dive is 305 meters.

Remus 300 has dual-frequency sonar with a resolution of up to 5 cm NBOSI conductivity and temperature sensor [CT] and depth sensor TE Connectivity. Additionally there are integrated other sensors and devices such as a 2G Robotics 4K HD camera with a high-intensity LED light strip a Seabird Scientific Eco Puck Triplet environmental sensor and a Klein MA-X sonar that fills the gaps.

The drone has an integrated commercial and military navigation system iXblue Phins C3 [INS] as well as a commercial or optional military system for global positioning Garmin [GPS]. It is powered by a DC brushless motor and has a blade for tilt and tilt control. Depending on the battery it can last underwater for 10 20 or 30 hours. The recharging time for lithium-ion batteries is between 12 and 18 hours.

According to the data on The Quantum Insider’s proprietary data platform D-Wave and MagiQ are the oldest pure quantum technology companies (as in founded specifically for that purpose) in existence both founded in 1999. However if you really want to knit pick you can find companies working with quantum/quantum computing technology these days that were founded prior to these enterprises’ existence such as Toptica (1998) Kelvin Nanotechnology (1997) FormFactor (1993) IronCap (1992) Cryofab (1971) and even Oxford Instruments which was founded way back in 1959!

This is without even talking about the large multinationals like IBM (1911) Intel (1968) Microsoft (1975) and Google (1998) that are the major players (along with several others) in the space in 2022.

This brings us to the focus of today’s article two companies founded in 2022 the Chinese Year of the Tiger.

Whether this founding year will be lucky for them is anyone’s guess; yet with the trajectory the quantum technology industry is heading all the signs look positive.

If you want to learn more we’ve compiled the most comprehensive list of the top quantum computing companies available!

Let’s do it then:

1. OklahomaQuantum Inc.

Based out of Norman Oklahoma OklahomaQuantum Inc. designs and manufactures Quantum inertial sensors that provide position when GPS is unavailable. Used in many industries such as autonomous vehicles submarines aircraft and spacecraft Quantum inertial sensors can provide near-absolute accuracy of acceleration because atoms are extremely sensitive to their environment. However quantum technology has many shortcomings to be put into practical use. OklahomaQauntum is developing a quantum inertial sensor that is highly integrated and compact for navigation.

Founded by CEO Saesun Kim a tech entrepreneur and winner of the international quantum hackathon hosted by Creative Destruction Lab — whose graduate work on generating atomic resonance quantum light has been selected as Editor’s Pick at the Optics letter — Kim also serves as co-lead of the IBM Qiskit localization project for an open-source project.

Poway - Diane Mardell Hayne of Poway CA age 80 passed away March 22nd 2022 after several bouts with cancer. Diane is survived by her son Willard Hayne IV of Littleton Colorado her sister and brother-in-law Collen and Randy Calhoun of Algona Iowa her sister-in-law Gretchen Lindsey of Des Moines Iowa and three grandchildren Willard V Melinda and Ty. She was preceded in death by her husband Willard Hayne III and two sisters Marlys and Phyllis.

Diane was born May 17 1941 in rural Iowa to Ervin and Lucile Frink. She was the first of four children all girls. Growing up in a farming community and attending small schools she enjoyed sports especially playing basketball on her high school team and helping her father in the fields. She attended a tech school in Des Moines Iowa for 2 years after which she worked at Look Magazine and then IBM until her marriage in 1968 to Willard Hayne III.

Diane and hubby moved to San Diego in 1968 where she again worked for IBM until the birth of her son in 1971. After a couple of moves to New Port Beach and Kansas City they purchased their forever home in Poway California. Diane loved her new home and friends in Poway. She was a stay-at-home mom and took up tennis bridge yard work and volunteering in her son's classroom as well as being active in neighborhood clubs and functions. During these years the family spent a couple of years in south Florida due to her hubby's work always anxious to return to Poway. She obtained her real estate license in 1985 and worked part time in property management for several years. In 1992 she and her husband formed an auto financing business until her hubby's health declined.

After her husband's death in 2005 she enjoyed visiting her son and grandchildren in Denver. She also travelled to Europe several times with friends. Hobbies included bridge reading and spending time with friends. Her partner and best friend Don Stampfli brought her much happiness the past decade or so which included several cruises and many other travels.

IBM was the first company to build programmable quantum computers and make them universally available through the cloud under Gil’s leadership.

In an interview during his recent visit to India Gil said he also met some government officials including Rajeev Chandrasekhar minister of state for electronics and information technology with whom he shared how IBM could help create a national quantum plan in India. Gil also explained how enterprises and governments can benefit from technologies such as the hybrid cloud edge computing quantum computing and shared his thoughts on Web3. Edited excerpts:





IBM outlined its commitment almost five years back to grow a quantum ready workforce and build an ecosystem to nurture the community in India. What's the progress?

We have made tremendous amount of progress and in fact it was one of their core aspects of the discussion with the minister (Rajeev Chandrashekar) that I had. They intend to make sure that India is a powerhouse in the world of quantum skills and quantum technologies. In this context access to the technology is crucial. That's why we're committed to the open-source environment--the most-widely one used around the world is Qiskit. We're seeing tremendous adoption in terms of advocates and quantum ambassadors here in India and we're also having many conversations right now with different IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology) and leading centers for training to develop a curriculum and certification. The Qiskit (to learn quantum computation) textbook is now also available in Tamil Bengali and Hindi. We're going to be running many workshops and lots of programs around it. I think there's a tremendous opportunity and part of our commitment is to figure out a way to grow these broad-based skills and talent programming in India for quantum.

What’s the progress on quantum computers and how do they currently compare with supercomputers?

Most of the computation will continue to run on classical computers whether in CPUs (central processing units) or accelerators (GPUs or gaming processor units) or AI but there are several important problems that are very well suited for quantum computers. One of them is the dimension of simulating and modeling our world.

It turns out there are also mathematical problems of great importance that are well suited to quantum computers such as cryptography and factoring. Blockchain crypto and other such technologies are going to have to be adapt and change because of the advances of quantum.

We have over 180 institutions that are part of the IBM Quantum Network and they include some of the largest corporations in the world from the financial sector like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo Mizuho Bank and others such as Daimler and also big energy companies in the oil and gas sector and some materials companies. There’s also a huge appetite in university and students with research laboratories participating in this.

But when will the world get to see a stable quantum computer that will work around current limitations such as noise leading to higher error rates interference etc.?

We already have quantum computers but they as you correctly pointed out have limitations. We still haven't crossed the threshold of quantum advantage (the so-called quantum advantage or quantum supremacy is a point when a quantum system performs functions that today's classical computers cannot) but they are quantum computers nonetheless. We have built over 30 of them in the last 4-5 years of which over 20 quantum computers are active right now with IBM providing access to them through the IBM Cloud. Every day we run three-and-a-half billion quantum circuits running on actual quantum hardware.

The roadmap we shared is that in the first year we will build 100 qubit quantum computer this year we're going to build a 433 qubit machine and next year a machine with over a 1000 qubits (A quantum computer comprises quantum bits or qubits that can encode a one and a zero simultaneously. This property allows them to process a lot more information than traditional computers and at unimaginable speeds.).

The error rate of the qubits is also improving tremendously (we can get to 10 to the minus 4 error rates). And the algorithms and software--the techniques we use for error mitigation and error correction--is also improving. If you combine all of this (and) if you want to be conservative we're going to see quantum advantage this decade.

What’s the roadmap for quantum computing?

We have seen AI-centric or GPU-centric supercomputers and we are most definitely going to see quantum-centric supercomputers. This is how it may work out. Imagine a quantum computer with hundreds or thousands of qubits with a single cryostat (Heat creates error in qubits hence they need to be cooled to near absolute zero in a device called a cryostat that contains liquid helium) and now imagine a quantum data center with multiple cryostats in a data center.

You could build a data center that has thousands or tens of thousands of qubits but the connection between these different cryostats in the first generation is classical. If you're smart enough to take a problem and partition the problem in such a way that you can run parallel workloads in the quantum machines and then connect them and stick them classically you still incur an exponential cost in the classical piece but can still get to a good answer.

The next step is to combine the field of quantum communications and quantum computing. It's a roadmap over the next 10-20 years but we will see quantum supercomputers and they are going to work in concert with the current supercomputers.

I would now like to segue into how the adoption of hybrid cloud has increased in enterprises and its evolution both from a market and research point of view.

From a market lens if you look at any kind of medium-size or large-scale business (from a market lens) this reality (of a hybrid cloud) is there. Simply put the question is how to make the hybrid cloud strategy work and continue to modernize the infrastructure so that the workloads and processes run optimally across it. That's explains why the open-source component and the acquisition of Red Hat was so crucial—to have an operating system based on Linux and having a container architecture based on Kubernetes. This is a $1 trillion plus annual market opportunity for us to provide the middleware infrastructure and right skills through IBM Consulting to help our clients operate and succeed in that environment.

From a computer science lens we have seen the huge importance of edge computing and if you look beyond you will also see the heterogeneous nature of architectures based on microprocessor-centric architectures like the AI accelerator-centric architectures and quantum-centric architectures in the future. So it’s critical to build a very heterogeneous very distributed computational environment and ensure it is architected properly and works.

Speaking about AI even as big data is important there is much effort to do a lot more with less data.

Yeah it's true. One extreme continues to be a story of how you learn from large amounts of data--we're talking about taking advantage of advances in self supervision to be able to train large foundational models and a good example is in NLP (Natural Language Processing). But the challenge our clients have had with AI is that the data science portion of it—the data labeling and training pipeline consumes 90% of the resources and (also consumes) a lot of time. So anything we can do to reduce this is hugely important. Then there's another vector--how do you inherently learn from less with much fewer examples with few short learnings and so on? This is an area where we invest a lot.

Semiconductors is another critical part of IBM Research. In May 2021 IBM announced its second-generation nanosheet technology has paved a path to the 2 nm node. Please explain the significance of this development.

The topic of semiconductors today has become a national and international priority. I meet with government leaders around the world and now politicians and citizens are realizing the importance of semiconductors because they (semiconductors) are literally in everything – cars refrigerators phones and computers. The semiconductor industry is a half-a-trillion-dollar industry. By all accounts this is going to double in size in the coming decade. To enable that growth innovation and manufacturing capability must go hand in hand.

IBM plays a central role on the innovation side in creating the new technology that enables manufacturers to bring that capability to the world at scale. As an example the announcement last year on the 2 nanometer technology is incredibly exciting because there's almost nothing more impactful than a next generation transistor (allows a chip to fit up to 50 billion transistors in a space that is the size of a fingernail). We also recently (in December 2021) announced the Vertical Field Effect transistor or the VTFET—a design aimed at enabling smaller more powerful and energy-efficient devices. Of course we use the expertise we have in semiconductor technology to build quantum computing as well.

What’s your role as a member of the National Science Board?

The National Science Board is the entity that is the governing board of the National Science Foundation (NSF) of the United States. It funds a very significant part of all the basic science work. The characteristic of that funding is that it is curiosity driven and not driven by application. It's about advancing the frontiers of mathematics physics chemistry and biology and is hugely important that we as societies defend and support the need for that kind of discovery. Without that investment it (discovery) takes many decades.

Before we wrap up I would love to have your thoughts on Web 3.0 and metaverse—the two buzzwords that are currently taking the industry by storm.

I like to see the foundations of these areas. On Web 3.0 it's back to the computer science story. It's about how we build the next generation of truly distributed computational environments. We touched on this lens from the perspective of a hybrid cloud. But this is complementary to that because it is about: How do you build in this case a web architecture and a network architecture that is inherently distributed by design? This requires thinking about a lot of foundation things--right from the security dimension to the semantic nature of the relationship around that. The previous version (of the web) was all about interactivity. Now it's also about how we bring together sensors and the fact that we have computers everywhere and humans interacting with it. So it's this next generation architecture I think is fundamental.

As for the metaverse maybe I’m not the most qualified person to talk about it (but) obviously it's going to be a hugely important way to extend the way we entertain and collaborate. (But) I really would like that technology is also oriented towards (solving a) broader set of problems.

Collins Aerospace today announced its Perigon computer will be the first certified aviation solution to use the Intel Atom x6400E processor. The advanced processor will underpin Perigon’s ability to support customers’ next-gen flight control and vehicle management needs across a broad range of commercial and defense platforms.

To bring advanced capabilities like single pilot and autonomous operations to life future aircraft will require an order of magnitude increase in onboard computing power. Supported by Intel’s Atom x6400E Perigon will deliver 20 times the processing power of Collins’ existing flight control computers and allow customers to load a variety of complex software applications including fly-by-wire and autonomous flight control.

In addition since the Atom x6400E delivers some of the highest processing power per watt of any processor on the market it will strengthen Perigon’s ability to operate in harsh aircraft thermal environments by minimizing its power consumption and heat generation.

Thus pre-built desktops and laptop PCs with Intel CPUs will invariably come with a shiny holographic sticker already adhered in a prominent position. If you have lost one of these stickers or somehow become spoiled you might be pleased to know Intel has a quick and efficient Replacement Intel Inside Logo Label program. How do we know it is fast and efficient? Because Redditor Excellent-Ad-7062 just used the service and gave it a glowing review.

The Redditor recently bought a used Intel processor for a system and as he ""always liked the stickers"" wondered about how to acquire one. Of course if you search Google you will come across various eBay and Amazon sellers. Still if you have proof of purchase of an Intel processor or system powered by an Intel chip you can get a new sticker for free via the link in the intro paragraph.

For proof of purchase you can screenshot or photo an invoice receipt or packing slip to send along with your online request form. If you don't have any of that kind of proof you will be able to save a screenshot from the Intel System Support Utility (linked to via the form) instead.

We edited the picture for height and readability (Image credit: Redditor Excellent-Ad-7062)

Intel's response to the request impressed the Redditor who said the new sticker arrived briskly via FedEx with a note as above. Others commented that filling in the form to the arrival of the sticker took three days. Intel's note is charmingly polite but assertive about how to make use of the new sticker. ""Your support for the consistent and proper use of our brand identity is greatly appreciated"" writes Intel. ""By applying your label to the front of the system bezel it will help ensure that we consistently meet our brand promise to deliver innovation reliability and leading-edge technology.""

Genuine Intel stickers have a certain quality about them. Holographic elements give them an eye-catching depth when viewed from various angles. Depending on the processor generation you will also see a representation of the processor architecture from the back. Tip: check this out before sticking the sticker on your PC.

Please note that users in some countries will face a customs fee for the import/processing of the Intel replacement sticker.

We hope Intel extends its service to include Arc graphics stickers. Sadly holy PC trinity rivals AMD and Nvidia don't appear to offer a similar sticker replacement service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vaW50ZWwtYXJjLWEtc2VyaWVzLWdwdXMtZGlmZmVyZW5jZXMtaW1wb3J0YW5jZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Intel's Arc A-Series GPUs Are Different And Why They're Important,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vaW50ZWwtYXJjLWEtc2VyaWVzLWdwdXMtZGlmZmVyZW5jZXMtaW1wb3J0YW5jZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9jb21tdW5pdHkvdG9waWNzL2xvc3QteW91ci1pbnRlbC1pbnNpZGUtc3RpY2tlci1nZXQtYS1uZXctb25lLWZvci1mcmVlLjI3NDYxNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lost your Intel Inside sticker? Get a new one for free,"PSA: Intel runs a program to send Intel Inside stickers to anyone without one that has an Intel processor. So if you've got a spare spot on your case or laptop for a shiny little holographic decal and you'd like one why not ask?

Intel has run this program as part of the Intel Inside scheme for a long time but it's now come to the forefront of the Intel fandom after a Redditor sought to test it. His processor didn't come with a sticker because it was second-hand but fortunately Intel was happy to send him one.

According to the Intel Processor Label Replacement Request Form -- yes there's a dedicated form and landing page -- you only need an invoice or receipt as proof of purchase. Failing that a screenshot of the processor's ID within the Intel System Support Utility will also suffice.

Intel will send you the appropriate sticker be it Core i7 Pentium Xeon or whatever else within a matter of days according to Redditors. If you live outside the US there might be an import tariff to the tune of about a dollar.

Most chipmakers have stickers of some kind or another but the Intel Inside program is the original. It was started in 1991 and was one of the first attempts by a hardware manufacturer to build a brand name for itself among the general public. At the time analysts thought people weren't interested in what was inside their computers.

But Intel executives loved it and gave the program a $250 million budget to be divided up between Intel's own ads and deals with OEMs to add Intel Inside branding to their marketing. By 1992 over 500 OEMs had joined the program.

And the rest is history. Intel is reported to have shrunk the program over the last five years -- though not publicly so to what extent is difficult to gauge -- but you can still find their stickers on all sorts of stuff.

Passing-through NICs avoid the hypervisor overhead and also can help with compatibility issues using virtual NICs and some firewall appliances like pfSense and OPNsense. The downside is that unless the NICs support SR-IOV they most likely will not be shared devices in this configuration.

Step 1: BIOS Setup

The first thing one needs to do is to turn on the IOMMU feature on your system. For this the CPU and the platform need to support the feature. These days most platforms will support IOMMU but some older platforms do not. On Intel platforms this is called “VT-d”. That stands for Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d.)

On AMD platforms you will likely see AMD-Vi as the option. Sometimes in different system firmware you will see IOMMU. These are the options you want to enable.

Of course since this is Proxmox VE you will want to ensure your basic virtualization is on as well while you are in the BIOS. Also since it is going to likely be a main focus for people using this guide if you are making a firewall/ router on the machine we usually suggest setting the On AC Power setting to “Always on” or “Last state” so that in the event of a power failure your network comes up immediately.

Next we need to determine if we are using GRUB or systemd as the bootloader.

Step 2: Determine if you are Using GRUB or systemd

This is a newer step but if you install a recent version of Proxmox VE and are using ZFS as the root (this may expand in the future) you likely are using systemd not GRUB. After installation use this command to determine which you are using:

efibootmgr -v

If you see something like “File(\EFI\SYSTEMD\SYSTEMD-BOOTX64.EFI)” then you are using systemd not GRUB.

Another giveaway is when you boot if you see a blue screen with GRUB and a number of options just before going into the OS then you are using GRUB. If you see something like this you are using systemd:

This is important because many older guides are using GRUB but if you are using systemd and follow the GRUB instructions you will not enable IOMMU needed for NIC pass-through.

Step 3a: Enable IOMMU using GRUB

If you have GRUB and most installations today will then you will need to edit your configuration file:

nano /etc/default/grub

For Intel CPUs add quiet intel_iommu=on:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""quiet intel_iommu=on""

For AMD CPUs add quiet amd_iommu=on:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""quiet amd_iommu=on""

Here is a screenshot with the intel line to show you where to put it:

Optionally one can also add IOMMU PT mode. PT mode improves the performance of other PCIe devices in the system when passthrough is being used. This works on Intel and AMD CPUs and is iommu=pt. Here is the AMD version of what would be added and we will have an Intel screenshot following:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""quiet amd_iommu=on iommu=pt""

Here is the screenshot of where this goes:

Remember to save and exit.

Now we need to update GRUB:

update-grub

Now to go Step 4.

Step 3a: Enable IOMMU using systemd

If in Step 2 you found you were using systemd then adding bits to GRUB will not work. Instead here is what to do:

nano /etc/kernel/cmdline

For Intel CPUs add:

quiet intel_iommu=on

For AMD CPUs add:

quiet amd_iommu=on

Here is a screenshot of where to add this using the Intel version:

Optionally one can also add IOMMU PT mode. This works on Intel and AMD CPUs and is iommu=pt. Here is the AMD version of what would be added and we will have an Intel screenshot following:

quiet amd_iommu=on iommu=pt

Here is the Intel screenshot:

Now we need to refresh our boot tool.

proxmox-boot-tool refresh

Now go to Step 4.

Step 4: Add Modules

Many will immediately reboot after the above is done and it is probably a good practice. Usually I like to add modules just to save time. If you are more conservative reboot then do this step. Next you will want to add modules by editing:

nano /etc/modules

In that file you will want to add:

vfio vfio_iommu_type1 vfio_pci vfio_virqfd

Here is what it should look like:

Next you can reboot.

Step 5: Reboot

This is a big enough change that you will want to reboot next. With PVE a tip we have is to reboot often when setting up the base system. You do not want to spend hours building a configuration then find out it does not boot and you are unsure of why.

We will quickly note that we condensed the above a bit for more modern systems. If something fails in the verify step below you may want to reboot before adding modules instead and also not turn on PT mode before rebooting.

Step 7: Verify Everything is Working

This is the command you will want to use:

dmesg | grep -e DMAR -e IOMMU

Depending on the system which options you have and so forth a lot of the output is going to change here. What you are looking for is the line highlighted in the screenshot DMAR: IOMMU enabled:

If you have that you are likely in good shape.

Step 7: Configure Proxmox VE VMs to Use NICs

For this we are using a little box very similar to the Inexpensive 4x 2.5GbE Fanless Router Firewall Box Review. It is essentially the same just a different version of that box. One of the nice features is that each NIC is its own i225-V and we can pass through each individual NIC to a VM. Here is a screenshot from an upcoming video we have:

In the old days adding a pass-through NIC to a VM was done via CLI editing. Now Proxmox pulls the PCIe device ID and then also the device vendor and name. This makes it very easy to pick NICs in a system. One point that is nice about many of the onboard NICs is that the physical ordering as the NICs are labeled on the system should mean that we have sequential MAC addresses and PCIe IDs. In the above 0000:01:00.0 is the first NIC (ETH0). The device 0000:02:00.0 is the second and so forth.

At this point you are already done. You can see we have this working on both OPNsense and pfSense and the process is very similar. The nice thing is that by doing this pfSense/ OPNsense have direct access to the NICs instead of using a virtualized NIC device.

A Few Notes on IOMMU with pfSense and OPNsense

After these NICs are assigned there are a few key considerations that are important to keep in mind:

Using a pass-through NIC will make it so the VM will not live migrate. If a VM expects a physical NIC at a PCIe location and it does not get it that will be an issue.

Conceptually there is a more advanced feature called SR-IOV that allows you to pass through a NIC to multiple devices. For lower-end i210 and i225-V NICs that we commonly see in pfSense and OPNsense appliances you will be conceptually dedicating the NIC to the VM. That means another VM cannot use the NIC. Here is an example where we have the pfSense VM (600) using a NIC that is also assigned to the OPNsense NIC. We get an error trying to start OPNsense. The Proxmox VE GUI will allow you to configure pass-through on both VMs if they are off but only one can be on and active with the dedicated NIC at a time.

Older hardware may not have IOMMU capabilities. Newer hardware has both IOMMU and ACS so most newer platforms make it easy to separate PCIe devices and dedicate them to VMs. On older hardware sometimes how PCIe devices are grouped causes issues if you want to as in this example pass-through NICs separately to different VMs.

You can utilize both virtual NICs on bridges along with dedicated pass-through NICs in the same VM.

At 1GbE speeds pass-through is not as big of a difference compared to using virtualized NICs. At 25GbE/ 100GbE speeds it becomes a very large difference.

When we discuss DPUs one of the key differences is that the DPU can handle features like bridging virtual network ports to physical high-speed ports and that happens all on the DPU rather than the host CPU.

This is an area where it takes longer to setup than a bare-metal installation and it adds complexity to a pfSense or OPNsense installation. The benefit one gets is that doing things like reboots is usually much faster in the virtual machine. One can also snapshot the pfSense or OPNsense image in the event one makes a breaking change.

We suggest having at least one more NIC in the system for Proxmox VE management and other VM features. If one uses pass-through for all NICs to firewall VMs then there will not be a system NIC.

This is probably not exhaustive but hopefully this helps.

Final Words

This is a quick guide to setting up a PCIe pass-through NIC on Proxmox VE for when you are virtualizing pfSense OPNsense or another solution. It is more geared towards newer hardware made since 2017 or 2020 so if you have an older system there may be more tweaking required. This used to be a feature that companies like Intel used for heavy segmentation for its chips in markets but most will support VT-d these days.

Production is set to commence in Sydney later this year and will premier on 10 in 2023.

Set in 2000 “Paper Dolls” which is produced by Helium Pictures follows the meteoric rise and fall of fictional girl band Indigo a manufactured pop group born on one of the first reality talent TV shows.

The drama focuses on five women aspiring for pop stardom only to find their dream of fame compromised by what it takes to achieve it. At first competitors and then confidants as Indigo achieves instant success and stardom their secrets threaten to tear the band apart particularly as one member returning to the music industry threatens to implode the group as she seeks revenge on a former record label that wronged her.

“Paper Dolls” is produced by Helium’s Mark Fennessy created and written by Ainslie Clouston (“Amazing Grace” “Playing for Keeps”) and developed with Claire Phillips (“RFDS” “Playing for Keeps”) with Belinda Chapple serving as co-executive producer.

Chapple herself was a member of the former girl band Bardot which was created on Australia’s first season of “Popstars” the popular international television reality franchise that set the stage for the explosion of talent shows such as “Pop Idol.”

“‘Paper Dolls” is a deeply fascinating female-driven drama with a female-led creative team. This dramatic and compelling series is defined by its unique mix of fun and edge – equal parts gritty and aspirational” said Fennessy who founded Helium last year.

The company’s initial slate also includes for Paramount Plus drama series “Last King of the Cross” based on John Ibrahim’s best selling book and starring Ian McShane as well as coming-of-age feature film “6 Festivals.”.

New York CNN Business —

The US may have the world’s most powerful military but the dollar is its greatest weapon. Now after nearly 80 years of dollar dominance the US might be in danger of losing its global reserve currency status.

About 60% of the $12.8 trillion in global currency reserves are currently held in dollars giving the US an exorbitant privilege over other countries. And that privilege pays: Because US government debt backed by the dollar is very attractive interest rates are lower. The US gets to borrow from other countries in its own currency — so if the US dollar loses value debt does too. American businesses can make international transactions in dollars without having to pay conversion fees.

Perhaps most importantly in extreme circumstances the US can cut off dollar access to central banks around the globe isolating and draining their economies. Raghuram Rajan the former governor of the Reserve Bank of India calls this power an “economic weapon of mass destruction.”

The US detonated this weapon on Russia in February after the country invaded Ukraine freezing $630 billion worth of forex reserves and deeply undermining the value of the ruble. That gave America the ability to punish Russia without getting US troops involved in war.

But with great power comes great responsibility: When you use a weapon of mass destruction even an economic one people get spooked. To protect themselves from the same fate as Russia other countries diversify their investments away from the US dollar into other currencies.

That’s where the country’s reserve currency status could run into problems.

Weaponizing the dollar said Bank of America strategists’ Michael Hartnett could lead to its debasement. The “balkanization of global financial systems” erodes America’s role as the reserve currency he added.

A new research paper by the International Monetary Fund found that the dollar share of international reserves have been in decline for the past two decades around the same time the United States began its war on terror and its counter-terror sanctions. One quarter of reserves have since shifted from the dollar to Chinese yuan and the other three quarters have moved into currencies of smaller countries.

“These observations provide hints of how the international system may evolve going forward” warned the paper’s co-authors Serkan Arslanalp of the IMF Barry Eichengreen of the University of California Berkeley and Chima Simpson-Bell also of the IMF.

Russia and China are also hoping to guide the evolution of the international system.

Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened on Thursday to end gas exports to countries that do not open an account with a Russian bank and pay in rubles. The European Union gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia with no easy alternatives.

Saudi Arabia meanwhile is in talks with Beijing to accept yuan instead of dollars for Chinese oil sales.

So is king dollar about to be dethroned?

If the past two years have taught us anything it’s that nothing is impossible. But the prospect of the US losing that exorbitant privilege is very unlikely.

For one thing the alternatives aren’t great. China has been pushing the yuan for years and only about 3% of global transactions are conducted in the currency that’s compared to 40% for the dollar.

The US is also still fairly attractive to the rest of the globe. The US equity market is the largest and most liquid stock market in the world and foreign capital is flowing into the country. Global foreign-direct investment flows grew by 77% to an estimated $1.65 trillion in 2021 but the investment in the US soared by 114% to $323 billion according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

Goodbye Q1 hello Q2!

The second quarter may not be fun but at least we’ll be prepared for it.

The seesaw first quarter of 2022 came to a bitter end this week with major stock indices printing their worst performance in two years. Surging inflation Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a speed-up of the Federal Reserve’s rate-increase plan created a series of unique challenges for investors.

Those challenges will continue into the second quarter. But often the devil you know is better than the devil you don’t.

We asked analysts what they predict will be the largest headwinds going into this quarter and how they’re preparing for them. Here’s what we found.

Geopolitical unrest: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has stunned markets across the globe. The geopolitical unrest has rippled through energy markets commodities and even to food insecurity issues.

Josh Leonardi director of prime services at TD Securities is looking to commodities markets where raw products are sold to hedge against the Russian conflict. He likes wheat in particular. About a quarter of the world’s wheat supply comes from Russia and Ukraine. Future contracts for the crop are through the roof as supply becomes scarce but demand remains the same.

It’s probably best not to bet on oil and energy since those commodities have been particularly volatile and reactive to news updates.

Inflation: The US is currently battling an inflation problem the likes of which it hasn’t seen in 40 years so it’s time to look to real assets as a hedge on inflation said Leonardi. That means investing in commodities real estate land equipment and natural resources.

Interest in real estate investment is exploding he said. “I don’t know if anything is hotter on the market right now. You have everything from single- and multi-family homes to data centers to cold storage facilities.”

When investing in markets look to companies that make money off of inflationary spikes. Banks earn more as interest rates rise and they profit from wider spreads. Companies with low capital needs are also good bets.

Rate hikes: The Federal Reserve is probably going to be aggressive in raising interest rates going forward said Liz Anne Sonders managing director and chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.

Typically investors believe in a safety guard known as “The Fed put.” It’s the notion that enough market weakness will cause the Fed to stop raising interest rates and tighten policy and perhaps even reverse and ease rates. Because inflation is so out of hand there’s no way that’s going to happen this time around said Sonders.

“Investors need to be aware of that especially if they’re being more aggressive because they think the Fed won’t let markets down” said Sonders. They’ll continue to raise rates and will do it to slow economic growth. That means the risk of recession is higher than it otherwise would be.

Charlotte is one of the prime examples of the trend of large Wall Street investors buying up housing stock especially in distressed neighborhoods communities of color and neighborhoods with a large amount of rental housing units.

""Last year investors bought nearly 1 in 7 homes sold in the nation’s top metropolitan areas — the most in two decades of record-keeping according to a Washington Post analysis of data from realty company Redfin"" according to the article. In Charlotte those numbers are more like one in four. The only city where investors are buying a larger share of the number of housing for sale is Atlanta according to the Post analysis.

In a move that has been repeated by a growing number of neighborhood and homeowners associations around the country according to the article the Potters Glen Homeowners Association in Charlotte created a new rule that requires any new home buyer in the neighborhood to wait two years before renting their new home out. ""Since the board adopted the rule in 2019 property records show the pace of investor purchases has dropped by more than half"" according to the article.

For the record some institutional investors are pushing back on tactics like the Potters Glen rule in terms that echo the opposition to exclusionary zoning practices.

Invitation Homes one of several big firms that own houses in Potters Glen called the rental restrictions ""prejudicial discriminatory uninformed and misaligned with the concept of fair housing."" The company said it was ""disheartened by the trend of HOAs [homeowners associations] determining that renters are not welcome in their neighborhoods.""

For another example of resistance to the growing footprint of Wall Street in the real estate market see the example of the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority which in January 2022 beat out a long list of investors for the purchase of 195 houses in Cincinnati and surrounding Hamilton County.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has entered into an agreement with pharma giant Novartis AG to acquire cardiovascular brand Cidmus in India for $61 million.

The Cidmus brand will be affixed on the pharmaceutical composition comprising a combination of Valsartan and Sacubitril (currently under Novartis patent) which is indicated for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction. The tablets were available in three strengths the company said.

Dr. Reddy’s said it would be looking to leverage its wide base to significantly enhance the reach of the product in and beyond metros into tier-I and tier-II markets in India.

Given the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases this acquisition will allow Dr. Reddy’s to make a trusted portfolio of medicines available to the patients. Cidmus will be a strong addition to its existing portfolio in the cardiovascular segment alongside brands such as Stamlo Stamlo Beta Reclide-XR and Reclimet-XR.

The acquisition would take the company closer to its ambition of breaking into the top 10 cardiac players in the Indian pharmaceutical market. It would also strengthen the company’s presence in the chronic space in the country Dr. Reddy’s said.

—————–

MARQUETTE — In the world of Upper Peninsula high school boys basketball Westwood 5-foot-10 senior Zach Carlson is one of the shortest elite players.

But his numbers and big-time performances make him stand out as much as players nearly a foot taller.

Carlson was one of five players named to the All-U.P. Dream Team when awards were determined at the annual basketball meeting of the U.P. Sportswriters and Sportscasters Association on Tuesday at the Holiday Inn of Marquette.

He is part of an all-senior elite squad joining 6-9 Colin Hudson of Escanaba 6-3 Jaden Borseth of Ewen-Trout Creek 6-2 senior Jonny Schutz of Jeffers and 6-1 Aidan Bellisle of Menominee.

Carlson can slash inside with the best of them and he averaged 24.4 points per game as a senior with the Patriots. He had other per-game averages of 4.5 assists 4.2 steals and 4 rebounds while making 48 percent from the field and 71 percent on free throws.

Carlson was also named the Player of the Year in both the West PAC and Mid-Peninsula Conference along with earning a berth on each league’s All-Defensive Team.

In fact it was the third straight year he was listed among the M-PC’s elite defenders and second time in three years in the West PAC.

He’s no stranger to accolades also making the U.P. Dream Team as a junior a year he was also Detroit Free Press honorable mention all-state West PAC Dream Team and M-PC First and All-Defensive teams.

And even as a sophomore he was both First Team and All-Defensive Team in each of his leagues.

He helped the Patriots win a Division 3 district championship a few weeks back before they ran into eventual state runner-up Menominee in their regional opener and were eliminated.

Carlson scored 20 points in WHS’ 74-57 setback putting in 13 in the final quarter.

One game earlier he had an important 28 points as Westwood built a huge 53-24 lead after three quarters before withstanding an amazing 41-point fourth quarter by Jeffers to capture the district.

During tourney time opposing coaches and teams kept commenting on the importance of trying to stop Carlson. Usually the emphasis was on “trying.”

“When Carlson is making his shots they’re a good team” Bellisle said during the regional game between Menominee and Westwood. “Tonight we were able to keep his scoring down.”

Similar sentiments were voiced by Calumet coach Frank Bonacorsi whose Copper Kings fell to the Pats 59-30 in the district semifinals.

“We really tried to dictate (the pace) and we really tried to keep the ball out of Carlson’s hands because he’s one heck of a player he’s the player of the year in our conference for a reason” Bonacorsi said. “We were trying to do everything we could to keep it out of his hands and even then he could still get his.”

And on the early February night that Carlson surpassed 1000 points in his high school career the opposing coach was still happy as Escanaba escaped with a 68-50 triumph.

“Carlson got 24 (points) but I think it was a tough 24” Esky coach Tracy Hudson said.

Iron Mountain coach Harvey “Bucky” Johnson also knows about Carlson’s prowess.

“When he gets the ball and steals it we’re in trouble because we’re not catching him and he’s gonna finish” Johnson said about Carlson after the Mountaineers’ 67-46 loss at Westwood in early January. “I’ve seen that in other games with him this year he’s done those things and give the kid credit he’s a good anticipator he’s strong he’s fast he’s a good handler of the ball and he’s able to put pressure on us.”

And a nearby coach has seen plenty from the Westwood star.

“He’s one of the elite players in the (Upper Peninsula) and we knew that we needed to contain him” Negaunee coach Dan Waterman said about Carlson after a game against the Pats. “But part of containing him is taking care of the ball offensively.

“I thought we defended him well up in Westwood but he started the second half up there with steal steal layup layup.”

Bellisle who was named U.P. Divisions 1-3 Player of the Year averaged 15.5 ppg along with 4.8 assists and 4.2 rebounds as he hit 1000 points during the season.

Hudson came in at 19.9 ppg and six rebounds each contest making 79 percent on his free throws and finishing as runner-up for Player of the Year in the Great Northern Conference behind Bellisle.

Schutz of Jeffers hit at 19.4 ppg 7.4 assists 6.7 rebounds and 44 percent on 3s as he played hurt early in the season that likely depressed some of his averages.

And the lone Division 4 Dream Teamer was the best. E-TC’s Borseth went on to be named D-4 Player of the Year then outballoted Bellisle for Mr. U.P. Basketball.

He hit at 18.7 ppg to go with five rebounds four assists as he actually hit 2000 career points during the district tournament that eventually turned into a berth in the state championship game when the Panthers took Wyoming Tri-unity Christian to overtime before falling 56-45.

The iron-rich rocks here began forming before there was oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere or even life itself. The area also harbors evidence of some of the earliest life—3.45-billion-year-old fossil colonies of microbial cyanobacteria the oldest known stromatolites on Earth.

The false-color image above shows part of the Hamersley Basin in Western Australia which lies on the southern Pilbara Craton. A craton is the stable geologically inactive core of an ancient continent. The Pilbara Craton has remained intact surviving the affronts of plate tectonics and erosion since the Archean Eon (4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago).

During the Archean and the Proterozoic Eon that followed multiple cratons assembled to form the Australian continent leaving multiple basins and belts of buckled and folded rocks at their margins. The main cratons that formed Western Australia are the Pilbara and Yilgarn. They began to assemble about 2.2 billion years ago during a mountain-building episode called the Capricorn Orogeny.

The land that is today known as the Hamersley Basin was then at the bottom of an ocean lying between the two cratons. The rocks of the basin preserve a record of the last ocean environment in the area before the cratons converged and closed the basin.

Atop the granite and greenstone rocks of the Pilbara Craton lie the younger rocks of the Fortescue Hamersley and Turee groups which were deposited between 2.7 billion and 2.3 billion years ago. Together these rocks form the Mount Bruce Supergroup which holds a singular place in Australia’s geologic history.

According to the Geological Survey of Western Australia not only do these rocks hold the best-preserved sequence of Archean volcanic rocks but they also include the most continuous rock record of the transition from the Archean to the Proterozoic 2.5 billion years ago (including a record of the Great Oxidation Event). In addition they are the most economically important ores on the Australian continent. These iron-rich rocks including the world’s thickest and most extensive banded iron formations form the basis of the iron-ore mining industry in the region.

The image was acquired by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) on NASA’s Terra satellite on October 12 2004. It is a composite of ASTER bands 4-2-1. These bands detect shortwave-infrared light near-infrared and visible red light and green light which are displayed as red green and blue respectively. In this display iron-rich rocks appear yellow to green. Light-colored iron-poor rocks appear white while dark-colored iron-poor rocks are dark blue. Areas with more vegetation cover appear dark red. This is because plants reflect more near-infrared than green light. A linear contrast stretch has also been applied to the image to enhance the color contrast and help distinguish rock types.

For example in the top center of the image the knob-shaped outcrop colored blue and green shows the rocks of the Hamersley Group—which includes four major banded-iron formations separated by sequences of iron-poor dolomites shales and volcanics.

At the top left of the image the white area shows the southeast portion of the Rocklea Dome which is composed of light-colored granites. The dome is the remnant core of a plunging anticline—a buckled-up ridge that tilts down into the ground. Erosion of the fold’s surface exposed the dome’s granite core which intruded into the surrounding rock during the Archaean Eon. The dome is also visibly crosscut with basalt intrusions. To the north these rocks underlie the Hamersley Group but here they are exposed at the surface.

The rest of the image largely shows the area underlain by the volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Fortescue Group. Much of this land is vegetated mostly Spinifex grasses shrubs and bushes. The bottom of the image shows the town of Paraburdoo and its airport.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""

From thousands of stocks 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5 Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand soaring 2022 earnings estimates and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares retail investors could jump in at any time.

This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

In the series based on Johnny B. Truant’s “Fat Vampire” novels Batalon plays a recently turned vampire Reginald who finds he still has mostly the same problems as his living counterparts: an evil boss unrequited love and a vampire chieftain out to get him. Fortunately it turns out Reginald isn’t entirely without powers of his own.

Batalon warns that “Reginald the Vampire” — produced by Thunderbird Entertainment-owned Great Pacific Media Modern Story and December Films and distributed internationally by Cineflix Rights — is not your typical broody vampire drama. “I think our show does a really good job of putting those tropes on its head” he says. “We absolutely poke fun at the fact that vampire films are drab and sort of dark and brooding and mysterious. We don’t take ourselves that seriously.”

Shooting wrapped in Canada just a few weeks ago and before Batalon even had time to unpack his suitcase he sat down with Variety to discuss the show.

How did you get involved in “Reginald the Vampire”?

It was sort of out of the blue. [Showrunner] Harley Peyton and [exec producer/director] Jeremiah Chechik and [exec producer] Todd Berger and Lindsay [Macadam senior VP for content and business development at Great Pacific Media] they all came to me with this thing. My agent spoke to me about it and it was the lead for a sci fi show. Apart from being a lead [role] I feel like the story really spoke to me. We had this meeting everybody talked about the underlying tones and what the show means and all these things and we really clicked and that’s how I became a part of it.

Have you read the novels?

My girlfriend and I read the first book of the “Fat Vampire” series by Johnny Truant and he was actually on set with us a couple of days. He’s a really great guy he’s really funny and really cool. It was cool to understand where the story came from. But obviously Harley being a really great writer and all this team of writers I feel like they’ve absolutely turned the story into something so much more relatable to today’s societal views. And I think that’s a very important aspect. So it was interesting to read the source of what Reginald was. A lot of the books [are] about the societal stigma of not being a prototypical leading man type and we put that on its head. We sort of normalize the fact that I’m not a typical white guy who’s buff and tall and blonde and all that stuff. I think that’s a great thing.

And as well as being a leading man you’re co-exec producing too.

It’s been a really cool experience to have an input and a say in the goings on and the dealings of the day and really having control over my character and having this ability to just be a part of the creative process on a deeper level.

How do you choose the projects you want to take on?

It’s based on what I find the most interesting. I think this show in particular having the chance to be the lead of a show has been something that’s been on my on my bucket list as an actor. It’s an experience that I just couldn’t pass up. And it is such a fun zany wild script that I know people will enjoy it. And really I think that’s it for me: finding things that I know are not prototypical finding things that are truly out there and speak to me on a deeper level than just like being funny or sad or dramatic. And I just really find that even though this story is based around vampires it’s relatable.

What was it like being part of a film as successful as “Spider-Man: No Way Home?”

It taught me a lot about fame and taught me a lot about experiencing the world and what it really means to be someone who people look up to in a sense. I’ve learned that the most successful people in the world are not fucking assholes and most importantly it’s just sort of how I carry myself. I mean fame is cool fame is great but it’s very fickle. More power to you if that’s all you want but a lot of people including myself – I feel like I’m searching for longevity.

In the “Spider-Man” comics your character Ned becomes Hobgoblin at one point. Is there any chance of us seeing that on screen?

From all my years of working for Marvel I feel like I’ve learned to just not say anything. I can’t really speak on things and then say something that might actually be true and then I ruin something you know what I mean?

Speaking of not being able to say anything what was it like keeping the secret that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were going to be in the movie?

I think it was just the scariness of ruining such a great surprise. We all understood it was such a momentous thing to happen in like not just a superhero movie but in cinema. To actually do something that crazy is wild. We just wanted to make sure that we kept it as [quiet] as possible so everyone could genuinely be so surprised and love it.

What was it like working with Maguire and Garfield?

It was amazing. They were really cool and wise and funny. Just like the funniest. Every day felt like it wasn’t real. It felt like we were sort of living everyone’s dream in a way. To have not just them but to have Willem [Dafoe] and Jamie [Foxx] and Alfred [Molina]. It was literally — it was amazing for sure.

What would your dream role be?

I’m kind of into crazy shit. I really love movies like “Sorry to Bother You” or things like that. Or anything twisted like “Twin Peaks” or something. Like I’ll do anything crazy. I just [finished watching the original] “Gossip Girl” and honestly I wouldn’t mind doing something like “The O.C.”-ish as well. I’m looking into weird zany things.

What are you working on next?

I’m taking a break for a bit. But if anything comes up that I find truly interesting I’m absolutely all for it. It just has to be the right thing for me to really get my ass out of bed.

The Mets did not set a timetable for deGrom's return but he's certain to miss the entirety of April including the Opening Day start he was scheduled to make next week.

Jacob deGrom TEX • SP • #48 ERA 1.08 WHIP .55 IP 92 BB 11 K 146 View Profile

While deGrom is the latest he's hardly the only star deemed out for Opening Day. Rather there are enough high-quality players who will be sitting on the sidelines when the regular season begins next week that we here at CBS Sports figured it would be prudent to offer a ""refresher"" of sorts. As such below you'll find 14 other notable individuals who will miss at least the start of the season because of injury.

Do note that the players are presented in alphabetical order.

1. Ronald Acuña Jr. OF Braves

Ronald Acuna ATL • RF • #13 BA 0.283 R 72 HR 24 RBI 52 SB 17 View Profile

Acuña tore his ACL in July ending his season after 82 impressive games and preventing him from partaking in the Braves' World Series run. At last check he's hoping to return in early May but he might split time between the outfield and DH once he's activated by the big-league team. Acuña's spot in the lineup will be filled by either Adam Duvall or Alex Dickerson depending on how you look at things.

Shane Baz TB • SP • #11 ERA 2.03 WHIP .68 IP 13.1 BB 3 K 18 View Profile

Baz one of the top prospects in baseball per CBS Sports' estimation seemed likely to crack Tampa Bay's Opening Day rotation. Alas he underwent elbow surgery in late March to remove loose bodies. The expectation at the time was that Baz could resume throwing two to three weeks after the operation. He'll need some time to stretch back out meaning the best-case scenario for his return might fall in May.

Luis Castillo SEA • SP • #58 ERA 3.98 WHIP 1.36 IP 187.2 BB 75 K 192 View Profile

Castillo likely would've made his second consecutive Opening Day start were it not for shoulder soreness. Instead he'll begin the season on the injured list alongside fellow starter Mike Minor and utility infielder Donovan Solano. All three are expected to play in rehab games before rejoining the Reds at some point during the month of April.

Garrett Crochet CHW • RP • #45 ERA 2.82 WHIP 1.27 IP 54.1 BB 27 K 65 View Profile

Crochet who posted a 2.82 ERA last season as a rookie sensation was another victim of Friday's news cycle. The White Sox announced that he's likely to require Tommy John surgery. Should that prove to be the case he'll miss the entire 2022 season and could have his absence stretch into next year's campaign depending on his rehab.

Jack Flaherty DET • SP • #9 ERA 3.22 WHIP 1.06 IP 78.1 BB 26 K 85 View Profile

The Cardinals ruled out Flaherty in mid-March after he received a PRP injection to combat a small tear in his throwing shoulder. The Cardinals provided a timetable at the time that would see him resume throwing after at least two weeks. Flaherty will have to build up arm strength at that point meaning he's not likely to appear in April.

6. Tyler Glasnow RHP Rays

Tyler Glasnow LAD • SP • #31 ERA 2.66 WHIP .93 IP 88 BB 27 K 123 View Profile

Glasnow's absence from Opening Day has been a given since he underwent Tommy John surgery last August. That operation tends to carry with it at least a 12-month recovery period meaning there's little chance he returns ahead of August or September.

James Karinchak CLE • RP • #99 ERA 4.07 WHIP 1.21 IP 55.1 BB 32 K 78 View Profile

Karinchak will have to wait a while to atone for a miserable second half of 2021. He was shut down from throwing last week because of a right teres muscle strain. He'd previously been dealing with arm stiffness. It's unclear when he'll return.

Evan Longoria ARI • 3B • #3 BA 0.261 R 45 HR 13 RBI 46 SB 1 View Profile

Longoria is expected to miss six weeks following an operation to repair a ligament in his right index finger. The injury had lingered from last season. Longoria is expected to be replaced in the San Francisco lineup by a combination of players including veteran infielder Wilmer Flores

Lance McCullers HOU • SP • #43 ERA 3.16 WHIP 1.22 IP 162.1 BB 76 K 185 View Profile

McCullers Jr. originally suffered a flexor tendon injury during last fall's American League Division Series. Unfortunately he suffered multiple setbacks during the offseason putting him behind his original timetable. The Astros expect him to pitch at some point during the 2022 season but it's unclear when he'll be back.

10. Alex Reyes RHP Cardinals

Alex Reyes LAD • RP • #27 ERA 3.24 WHIP 1.35 IP 72.1 BB 52 K 95 View Profile

Reyes the Cardinals' closer was deemed out in mid-March because of a frayed labrum. He received a stem cell injection at the time that required him to be shut down for a fortnight. Reyes was not expected to return to a big-league mound until late May or early June depending on how the healing process goes.

Chris Sale ATL • SP • #51 ERA 3.16 WHIP 1.34 IP 42.2 BB 12 K 52 View Profile

Sale has been on the shelf because of a ribcage fracture since mid-March. He underwent an MRI this week but the Red Sox still don't have a timetable on when he'll begin his throwing program. Sale has been snake bitten by injuries in recent years. He missed all of the 2020 season because of Tommy John surgery and he made just nine appearances last season after finishing his rehab.

Stephen Strasburg WAS • SP • #37 ERA 4.57 WHIP 1.38 IP 21.2 BB 14 K 21 View Profile

Strasburg is on the road to recovery from an operation that corrected his thoracic outlet syndrome. The Nationals' last update on his status was that he would probably miss April. Strasburg has been limited to just seven starts since the 2019 World Series when he won the Most Valuable Player Award and lifted the championship trophy.

Fernando Tatis SD • SS • #23 BA 0.282 R 99 HR 42 RBI 97 SB 25 View Profile

Tatis underwent surgery in mid-March for a fractured wrist that may have been suffered in an offseason motorcycle accident. His rehab from that operation was estimated as taking as long as three months putting his season debut sometime in mid-to-late June depending on how he progresses. The Padres figure to roll with Ha-Seong Kim and/or top prospect CJ Abrams at shortstop until Tatis returns.

14. Luis Urías 3B Brewers

Luis Urias SEA • SS • #16 BA 0.249 R 77 HR 23 RBI 75 SB 5 View Profile

We'll wrap this up with Urías whose contributions last season were worth nearly three Wins Above Replacement per FanGraphs' calculations. He's been dealing with a quad injury that hasn't healed as quickly as the Brewers hoped. Manager Craig Counsell told reporters he's hopeful to have Urías back in time for their second road trip but that would put him on the shelf for the first two weeks of the season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdHJlYWxpbmRpYW5zLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvNC8zL2RlbGF3YXJlLW5vcnRoLWhlYWQtb2YtdGhlLXNuYWtl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delaware North: Head Of The Snake — Last Real Indians,"The origins of Delaware North date back to mafia-run 1915 Buffalo NY. At that time brothers Marvin Charles and Louis Jacobs started a modest peanuts and popcorns concession company. Also at that time Cosa Nostra co-founder and mob boss Stefano Magaddino was slowly rising to power. He would succeed Buffalo crime boss Joseph DiCarlo after his death in 1922. Today Delaware North is owned by billionaire Jeremy Jacobs son to one of the company’s original founders (he is also owner of the Boston Bruins). Jacobs testified in the 1972 federal racketeering case on behalf of Emprise [National Archives: Identifier 7327672 Hearing Transcripts of the Select Committee on Crime for the 92nd Congress].



So what does any of this have to do with New York State Governor Kathy Hochul or the Seneca dispute? Well for starters Hochul’s husband William Hochul is gainfully employed as general counsel and senior vice president for Delaware North. Hochul had to sign an agreement recusing herself from all state dealings with Delaware North and her husband had to sign an agreement recusing himself from all company dealings in state matters. Delaware North holds the concessions contract for the current Buffalo Bills Stadium and it would be downright shocking if that contract were not renewed at the new stadium.

Here’s the real kicker: The original 2002 gaming compact between the Seneca Nation of Indians and New York State granted SNI exclusive gaming rights within a specified territory. This exclusivity was violated by partners New York State and Delaware North with three racetrack casinos within the forbidden zone. This violation led to the 2013 settlement which was at the center of the five year long controversy (ending dramatically this past Monday). The fact that Delaware North was directly involved in the violation of the exclusivity compact seems like a major conflict of interest when one considers the Hochul household income brought to you in part by Delaware North.



We agree it’s a lot to digest. Unfortunately there’s more. Delaware North also holds the concessions contract to the Niagara Falls State Park which includes Goat Island where tourists are sold overpriced ice cream french fries and bottled water. Goat Island was included in the nine year long land claim which the Seneca Nation of Indians brought against New York State. That land claim ended in June 2002 and just two months later the original gaming compact was signed. A slew of evidence including public testimonies by former Congressman John LaFalce former Seneca President Duane Ray and a chain of news articles; connect the land claim directly with the gaming compact. Oh and there’s also this:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzAzL2phY29iLWRlZ3JvbS1pbmp1cnktbWV0cy1hY2VzLWZydXN0cmF0aW9uLWxldmVsLXJlYWxseS1oaWdoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacob deGrom injury: Mets ace's frustration level 'really high',"PORT ST. LUCIE — A frustrated Jacob deGrom is trying to make the best of his latest injury.

In his first public comments since he was diagnosed two days earlier with a stress reaction on his right scapula the Mets ace on Sunday said he’s relieved knowing he’s dealing with a bone issue that should heal completely with rest.

“Structurally everything looks fine so once the bone heals then we’ll be ready to go and build up from there and hopefully be healthy for the rest of the year” deGrom said at Clover Park.

But the right-hander has been shut down from throwing for up to four weeks and will then need time to build up before he can rejoin the Mets rotation a process that could take him to late May or beyond.

DeGrom indicated he was blindsided by the injury which first came to his attention while playing catch on Thursday. An MRI exam the following day found the stress reaction.

To that point deGrom had pitched five innings over two appearances in the Grapefruit League and struck out 10 batters throwing his fastball in the 97-99 mph range.

It came after deGrom missed the second half of last season with forearm and elbow discomfort.

“I am really frustrated” deGrom said. “I came into camp feeling really good I felt like my elbow and shoulder were in a good spot and then to hear a stress reaction in the bone was definitely something I was not expecting so the level of frustration is really high right now.”

Manager Buck Showalter still hasn’t officially named deGrom’s replacement in the rotation (Tylor Megill David Peterson and Trevor Williams are the top candidates) as he navigates another short-term issue: Max Scherzer’s sore right hamstring.

DeGrom was scheduled to pitch Thursday’s opener in Washington. The Mets will know more about Scherzer after he throws a side session Tuesday.

In 15 starts last season deGrom pitched to a 1.08 ERA.

“You want to see him on the field for 35 starts” shortstop Francisco Lindor said. “You want to see him. He’s one of the greatest. I want to be part of watching this unfold. But we wish him nothing but the best and speedy recovery and we have got a job to do.”

Lindor pointed out that a healthy deGrom alone doesn’t guarantee success.

Jacob deGrom says he’s “really frustrated” about his latest injury. Corey Sipkin

“Even if [deGrom] was on the team how many games has Jacob lost because we didn’t do our job?” Lindor said. “Teams can still beat us 1-0. It sucks to watch him on the sideline. I want to see him every five days.

“The sky is not falling. We have got to focus on what we have. We have 26 other guys that are trying to do the job. It’s part of the grind. It’s part of adversity. We are athletes. We are going to get hurt.”

DeGrom said he wishes he could pinpoint what might have caused his latest injury.

“That is something I am trying to figure out because I felt like I put myself in a good spot this offseason to be ready to make 30-plus starts” he said. “I would be guessing if I said exactly what happened. I tossed around a short ramp up not pitching competitively in [8 ½] months but that would be a guess if I said exactly what happened.”

One thing hasn’t changed. Upon arriving to spring training deGrom said he planned to exercise the opt-out in his contract after this season. The right-hander signed a five-year contract worth $137.5 million before the 2019 season that included an opt-out after the fourth year. Asked on Sunday if he still planned to opt out deGrom answered in the affirmative."

Running back Duke Johnson announced his retirement Sunday after playing eight seasons in the NFL.

Drafted in the third round by the Cleveland Browns in 2015 out of the University of Miami where he became the school's all-time leading rusher Johnson played for four NFL teams. He last played in the league in 2022 when he appeared in a game for the Buffalo Bills.

""8 Years 4 teams with 1 goal in mind create a better life for my family"" he posted to Instagram. ""I never dreamed of being the all time leading rusher of my dream school or being somewhere on the list of all time players to come out of South FL. I just wanted an opportunity to play a game to provide a better life for my family and I was able to do just that. I want to thank each team for giving me the chance to play and represent your organization and all the fans that supported me through the highs and lows.""

He added: ""Last but DEFINITELY NOT LEAST I want to thank my GOD for allowing me to take this journey and end it in the same health I started it in. With that being said I'm officially retiring from the NFL. I hope I left a greater impression on y'all that's bigger than football.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson continues to oversee one of the narrowest House majorities in history leaving little margin for error as he navigates his conference and faces threats to his leadership.

Republicans control 217 seats while Democrats control 213 after Democratic Rep. Tim Kennedy of New York was sworn in Monday evening. There are currently five vacant seats.

That breakdown leaves Republicans with a one-vote margin which means they can only afford one defection from within their conference to still pass legislation on a party-line when all members are present and voting. A tie vote in the House is a fail.

In addition to the tight margin there is always the possibility that absences can further impact the vote math.

The tight vote margin means that any individual member has the potential to exert outsized influence and Johnson has frequently felt pressure from his right flank.

The extremely narrow margin has forced the speaker to put high-profile bills directly onto the floor under a procedural move known as suspension of the rules in certain instances as his right flank has increasingly taken to tanking rule votes on the floor in a show of protest.

But that strategy compels the need for a two-thirds majority to pass bills requiring significant Democratic support and further alienating Johnson from the right wing of his conference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDUvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcHJpc29uLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For Markus Johnson Prison and Mental Illness Equaled a Death Sentence,"Markus Johnson slumped naked against the wall of his cell skin flecked with pepper spray his face a mask of puzzlement exhaustion and resignation.

This is a global event to promote public enthusiasm and support for brain science sponsored by the Dana Foundation. “The Dana Foundation is a private philanthropic organization dedicated to advancing understanding about the brain in health and disease through research grants and public outreach. This event is conducted to promote and share the wonders of the brain and the impact brain science has on our everyday lives.” (www.dana.org/about-dana/) Saint Helena School joined 7300 other partners throughout 45 countries and 32 states.

Saint Helena School students participated in physical and mental challenges to enhance brain activity. These events were held during recess and teachers extended the lessons into the classrooms. Some events featured were: Crossing the Midline exercises demonstrations on memory and ways to improve it illusions a STROOP EFFECT experiment and the benefits of crocheting. Students also learned about neuroplasticity which is the brain’s ability to change and grow throughout a person’s life.

Students made a brain hat. This hat not only distinguished each lobe by color but identified what each part of the brain controls. (https://ellenjmchenry.com/brain-hemisphere-hat/) Abraham sixth-grader said “The best part was making the brain. It was fun helping the younger students make the hat and challenging as well.” The week ended with a Rubik’s cube competition and 24 Challenge a math game that challenges players to make the number 24 from the sum of four numbers shown on a playing card.

Arthur L. Johnson High School

On Wednesday March 23 Fifty-seven students from Arthur L. Johnson High School in Clark/Garwood were inducted into the newly established National English Honor Society (NEHS) during a ceremony in the school’s Instructional Media Center. This was the first induction ceremony for this group. Led by Advisors Lisa Rosso and Anthony Caldiero the ceremony celebrated the achievements of these students. It also discussed the pillars of the honor society and the responsibilities of its newly inducted members.

In order to be inducted students must have completed two years of English at the honors or AP level. They must have achieved a minimum overall and English grade point average of a 3.0 prior to induction as members.

According to the NEHS website the NEHS “is the only international organization exclusively for secondary students and faculty who in the field of English merit special note for past and current accomplishments. The NEHS motto ""gelast sceal mid are"" is Old English for: ""duty goes with honor."" The motto represents one of the earliest forms of our language — it affirms and celebrates an obligation to use one's gifts in service to others. Service to peers school and community is part and parcel of the NEHS mission.”

Caldiero said “We congratulate all of our new inductees. We look forward to their continued success as they uphold the pillars of NEHS throughout our school community.”

Rosso said “We decided to start this chapter of NEHS here at Arthur L. Johnson because there was a need to recognize those with such high accomplishments in a rigorous core course such as Honors or AP English. We also want to thank Senior Joe Garbowski for planting the seed of beginning a chapter here last year and accepting the responsibilities of being the President.”

Kean University

Kean University in Union is expanding academic options in musical theater performance and exercise science beginning in Fall 2022.

“Kean University is committed to offering world-class education that expands students’ horizons and prepares them for a wide variety of future careers or graduate study” said Kean President Lamont O. Repollet Ed.D. “These two new academic program options are in response to our students’ interests and needs.”

Kean’s undergraduate theatre offerings currently include majors in theater theater performance and theater design and technology. The new option BFA Theatre Performance: Musical Theatre is a concentration within the performance major.

“Musical theatre is something that we’ve known for years is a very popular degree” said Holly Logue director of the Kean Theatre Conservatory.

The new option adds more training in voice dance and music. Both theater performance options prepare students for performing careers as well as for many other future careers Logue said.

“Musical theatre is not just Broadway” she said. “It’s regional theater cruise ships becoming a performer at Disney. And when you think about transferable life skills theatre students are problem solvers and creators. They work collaboratively; they meet deadlines; they are poised presenters. Businesses want people with creative backgrounds and training and skills.”

Kean sophomore Brandon Luckenbaugh of Hillsborough a theater performance major said he looks forward to reviewing what new courses would be available in the new musical theater option. He said he wants to become a professional repertory actor and build a career in voice acting.

“Access to classes that have to do with music theory and potentially even choreography would absolutely interest me” he said.

In exercise science the new B.S. Exercise Science Pre-Athletic Training/Physical Therapy option adds a choice for students seeking a Bachelor of Science degree in the growing field.

“There are many different career paths for exercise science students” said Assistant Professor Adam Eckart coordinator of Kean’s exercise science program. “The base program prepares students for careers as exercise physiologists personal trainers group training instructors wellness coordinators and strength and conditioning coaches. The new option will be geared toward those students specifically planning to pursue a master’s degree in Athletic Training a Doctorate of Physical Therapy or other clinical careers after they graduate.”

The new option includes more emphasis on math science and health-related courses which means students applying to graduate programs would not need to take those prerequisites in addition to the regular exercise science program.

With exercise science in high demand Eckart said he believes interest will increase “without question” for Kean’s programs. Kean also offers Master of Science programs in exercise science and athletic training and a Doctorate of Physical Therapy program.

Both exercise science undergraduate options are offered within Kean’s School of Health and Human Performance.

“We expect the number of students enrolled in either program to spike considerably” he said.

Current students interested in both of the new options can discuss them with their advisors.

Milwaukee School of Engineering

Alexandra Sturm of Bernardsville at Milwaukee School of Engineering in Milwaukee Wisconsin was named to the winter dean's list with high honors. Students who have maintained a 3.70 or higher receive high honors.

Mount Saint Mary Academy

Sister Deirdre Mullan visited Mount Saint Mary Academy in Watchung on World Water Day on Tuesday March 22 to discuss with administration faculty staff and students the importance of water resources for impoverished countries in conjunction with the Mercy Girl Effect: Women at the Well initiative.

She shared lunch in the Heritage Room with members of the Student Council Executive Board as well as Sister Lisa D. Gambacortodirectress; Assistant Directresses Jacqueline Muratore and Denise Materia and Ruth Anne Munroe director of Campus Ministry and Student Council Coordinator. She also offered a presentation before the student body in the Sister Lisa Gambacorto Theater in the afternoon.

Sister Deirdre also met with Sophia Tiboni of New Providence who raised $6205 for the Mercy Girl Effect: Women at the Well from the Dress Express Boutique an initiative which promoted the collection repurposing and purchase of formal and semiformal dresses.

A Sister of Mercy from Ireland Sister Deirdre spent a quarter of a century as a teacher and administrator. She holds a doctoral degree in the feminization of poverty and is an advocate for female education. Sister Deirdre served as the executive director of Mercy Global Concern at the United Nations for more than 10 years and directed the Partnership for Global Justice. Since 2014 she has worked with UNICEF the body at the UN focusing on children’s and girls’ education and is the consultant adviser on their initiative “Partnering Religious Congregations with UNICEF.”

""In June 2021 the Executive Board was able to attend the Mercy Girl Leadership Conference in which we had the opportunity to listen to S. Deirdre and hear more about her work"" said Margaret Ferris of Westfield a member of the Student Council Executive Board. ""We were so inspired by her presentation that we knew we needed the rest of the Mount community to hear from her as well. Her presentation served as a reminder to the school that we are working together for something much bigger than ourselves. There was a very positive community feedback after her presentation and we are so proud of all of the efforts by the school to promote clean accessible water to those in need.""

Each well is $5000 and so far the Student Council Executive Board has successfully raised more than $18000. The goal for the end of this year is to be able to provide the funds for four wells which would cost $20000.

Hannah Cunniffe of Basking Ridge said ""Listening to S. Deirdre speak at the Mercy Girl Leadership Conference we knew that having her come to the Mount would provide our community a great opportunity to learn more about the importance of the ethical issue of water this year's project and how our donation will directly impact the lives of so many girls. S. Deirdre's presentation brought our attention to the meaning and impact of Women at the Well and I am so proud of how our school community has responded to this initiative to bring clean accessible water to those in need of this basic human right.”

Caitlin Cotter of Cranford said ""S. Deirdre's presentation emphasized the importance of supporting this initiative and raising awareness for water carriers. It is so important that as a school community we continue to support individuals and communities that do not have direct access to clean water and work toward assisting those in need.""

Also: Mount Saint Mary Academy in Watchung and St. Joseph High School in Metuchen coordinated an annual mathematics competition for seventh and eighth grade boys and girls on the morning of Saturday March 26. Jacqueline Muratore assistant directress for faculty curriculum and planning said 87 girls participated in the competition on the Mount campus.

Warren Middle School

Warren Middle School students in Donna Bardy’s English Language Arts (ELA) class recently finished reading the New York Times best-seller ""El Deafo"" a graphic novel by Cece Bell. Throughout Bell’s story the reader learns of Bell’s experiences growing up with hearing loss and her insecurities about using the phonic ear in a school setting where she is the only hearing-impaired student.

Bardy was moved by how her students responded to El Deafo and their positive reviews of the book. The students were very compassionate about her struggles trying to fit in. To provide the students with a special culminating experience Bardy called upon Warren Middle School Teacher Karen Monti Balich for assistance.

Balich a graduate of St. Joseph’s College in New York earned a degree in Education and Communications with a concentration in Speech and Language. Balich started her career as a Teacher of the Speech and Hearing Handicapped at St. Francis de Sales School where she provided articulation and language therapy for students at their primary and secondary levels. It was at St. Francis de Sales School where Balich became proficient in American Sign Language (ASL).

Balich offered to give up her planning period and lunch break on Friday March 25 to provide Bardy’s ELA classes with a lesson on ASL. The students were eager to listen and follow along with the lesson.

Balich prepared workbooks for each student with common words and phrases illustrated in ASL. Balich said ASL is a visual language requiring the use of the space in front of around and behind the communicator. The students learned very quickly how to sign their names.

Bardy was excited to see her students share their new knowledge of ASL with their peers in the following class.

Westfield Public Schools

Westfield High School 11th-grader Kevin Chen was selected to perform with the All-State Orchestra later this year.

The prices of residential air conditioners may go up by around 5 per cent as the industry faces soaring input costs even though the makers are looking for double-digit growth this year with early onset of summer spurring demand. Buoyed by the the recent prediction by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) about the summer temperature to stay ""above normal"" in April and May leading air conditioner (AC) makers including Voltas Hitachi  LG Panasonic and Godrej Appliances are expecting pent-up demand of the last two seasons that saw market disruptions due to COVID-19 pandemic.Some of them are expecting a greater demand this season which might also lead to a shortage of units putting them under pressure to meet the increased requirement for ACs and other cooling products.The industry has gone for a price hike last quarter to mitigate the impact of soaring prices of components metals especially copper and aluminium and rising crude oil after the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Companies are also luring the customers with offers and easy EMI schemes to make their purchases convenient.Tata group firm Voltas is expecting the residential AC industry to grow in terms of both volume and value this summer.""The industry has already been subject to multiple double-digit price hikes during the fiscal of 2021-22. However at Voltas given our consumer-centric philosophy we made sure that these hikes do not deter consumers from buying cooling products this summer and hence have introduced various consumer offers and easy EMI options to make purchases convenient for our customers"" Voltas Managing Director & CEO Pradeep Bakshi told PTI.The Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA) expects this peak season to contribute 35 to 40 per cent of the total annual sales. However it also cautions about a price hike.""Prices have been erratic over the past few years and the pandemic made the situation worse. In the past 18 months the consumer appliance/durable sector has seen an increase of up to 15 per cent in prices. The industry is reeling under constant pressure due to a surge in commodity inflation and raw material cost.""Nonetheless the price rise will not impact consumers on an immediate basis because the production of inventory is already planned till March-April 2022 . We can expect further price rise from May due to rise in prices of raw material crude oil freight cost etc"" said CEAMA President Eric Braganza. Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India which sells residential AC under the Hitachi brand said work-from-home culture is driving the growth of the industry while the pent-up demand might also lead to a shortage of air conditioners this season.One of the biggest challenges for manufacturers is to further hike the price without affecting this huge consumer demand said Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India Chairman and Managing Director Gurmeet Singh.""At Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air conditioning India Ltd so far we are doing our best to absorb the pressure forced by varied market conditions and unfavourable global circumstances to give some relief to consumers on the price end. However the way things are progressing on the commodity and other fronts we have to take up prices by another 3-4 per cent by April"" he said.For example a 3-star inverter split air conditioner which used to retail at Rs 33500 till last year has reached Rs 365000 to RS 37000.""The promotions which were being offered along with the ACs till last year have also been taken to a much lower level this year. This is directly related to the affordability of the manufacturers this year"" said Singh.Over the price hike Godrej Appliances Business Head and Executive Vice President Kamal Nandi said his company will wait and watch the situation.""With last two summers being affected by lockdown and many consumers postponing purchases so far the rising summer temperature and the hybrid working model being adopted by many companies is expected to support the demand even amidst the price increase"" he said.Panasonic India Business Head Air Conditioners Group Gaurav Sah said there is a huge demand for energy-saving inverter ACs and the company expects robust sales from all regions.""Meanwhile we are hoping to see a double-digit growth from the AC industry in this summer"" he said.However Sah also added: ""In line with the market and increasing commodity prices we had to increase the price of our air conditioners by around 6-8 per cent. We are carefully evaluating the input cost changes before we decide on another price hike.""According to Nandi the Indian Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) industry is sized at Rs 18000-20000 crore.""Air conditioner is one of the lowest penetrated product categories in India with only 5% penetration. With harsh summers and a need for comfort in every home/non-residential unit AC has become a necessity. Consumers will increasingly look at solutions to beat the monsoon-led oppressive humidity as well"" he said.LG Electronics India VP Home Appliances & Air Conditioners Deepak Bansal said with rising temperature he foresees good traction in air conditioners business and expects this demand to surge in Q2 of this calendar year.""This robust growth is due to strong product portfolio based on Indian insights equipped with stylish design and smart features which focuses on consumers' comfort health energy efficiency and core performance of product based on technology leadership"" he said.According to CEAMA President Braganza the Indian residential AC market is expected to be around 7 to 7.5 million units with more than 15 companies operating in the space.The segment is still highly dependent on imports with an average of 25 per cent local value addition only. The government had last year approved 26 applications for manufacturing of components of the air conditioner with a committed investment of Rs 3898 crore under the production linked incentive scheme.",,,

The JPMorgan Chase “Run as One 4M” in Central Park was designed to raise awareness for the fight against lung cancer.

New York Road Runners organized the run with the Thomas G. Labrecque Foundation. Sunday was the first time they have held the run since 2019 because of the pandemic.

“My dad was the epitome of selfless. He did and gave to everybody. He gave to everybody more than himself” Manansala said. “Our father actually passed away from the same cancer type that Thomas G. Lebrecque the namesake the the foundation died from.”

What You Need To Know The Run as One 4M kicked off for the first time in three years on Sunday



The Thomas G. LaBrecque Foundation conducts efforts to raise awareness for Lung Cancer



LaBrecque Former Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman never smoked and died of lung cancer in 2000



“Over 200000 people a year are diagnosed but if you pull out the people who have never smoked like my Dad that’s about 20% of the people” Thomas Labrecque Jr. said.

Labrecque didn’t smoke his entire life but died of lung cancer in 2000 at 62 years old. He was a former Chase Manhattan Bank chairman. His son Thomas G. Labreque Jr. is dedicated to teaching people about lung cancer.

“It’s non-small cell lung cancer is normally what never smoker lung cancer is. It is a well-known cancer we just don’t know why never smokers get it” Labrecque said “Over 200000 people a year are diagnosed but if you pull out the people who have never smoked like my Dad that’s about 20% of the people.”

Labrecque said his father’s diagnosis has taught him a lot about lung cancer prevention — and he hopes to pass that knowledge on to others.

“The best advice I could give anybody is if you have a cough that’s there for three months and you don’t understand why just turn around and get it checked out. Especially if you are a never smoker because that is what normally happens” Labrecque Jr. said. “The other issue we are really trying to raise awareness about is that there is no good early detection.”

This effort is something that the Manansala family work to help spread to keep their father’s memory alive.

“We go by 'Team Papa' because everyone who knew my dad knew him as ‘Papa’” Manansala said. “Regardless of who you were you were family to him. If you needed the shirt off his back he would give it to you.”

Organizers say the Labrecque Foundation has raised about $18 million for lung cancer awareness since it's founding.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL25ld3MvZmVhdHVyZXMvMjAyMi0wNC0wMy9zYW0tYmFua21hbi1mcmllZC1mdHgtcy1jcnlwdG8tYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtd2hvLXdhbnRzLXRvLWdpdmUtaGlzLWZvcnR1bmUtYXdhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A 30-Year-Old Crypto Billionaire Wants to Give His Fortune Away,"Why did this happen?

About 70 members and staff gathered at the Country Club of Vermont on Wednesday with more tuning in online via Zoom. In attendance was Laura Vilalta owner of Black Cap Coffee who just two days prior was announced as the new tenant for the Waterbury Train Station which is owned by Revitalizing Waterbury.

The group saluted her as she sets out to transform the downtown landmark into a new coffee shop and bakery reopening the historic facility after it has sat closed since March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic began. Prior tenant Keurig Dr. Pepper closed the Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Cafe and Visitors Center at the station and later decided in 2021 it would not reopen. Black Cap plans construction to customize the space with an opening expected later this year.

Resuming activity at the train station beyond the twice daily Amtrak arrivals was at the top of the group’s list of endeavors for 2022. In a slide presentation that is now available on the Revitalizing Waterbury website members of the RW board of directors and staff recapped 2021 highlights and pointed to projects for this year.

A busy 2021

Last year saw the completion of Main Street reconstruction for which the organization was involved with coordinating communication for and with local businesses and planning the beautification elements of the project such as signage flower planters and benches and public art.

The organization’s various activities from 2021 fall into four categories: economic development downtown designation status community programming and outreach and direct support to businesses.

Economic development activities last year included hiring an economic development director Mark Pomilio Jr. That work involves assisting businesses with locating and relocating obtaining guidance on permitting processes and applying for grants. Downtown-focused activities greatly involved Main Street construction impacts on businesses work with town planners on revising development regulations and assisting businesses navigating programs for tax credits and government loans.

Outreach takes in activities including the annual arts festival grants for local organizations to host events expanding public art installations beautification tourism promotion and collaboration with the Stowe Area Association and the Mad River Valley Chamber of Commerce to promote tourism along the Route 100 corridor.

Direct support to local businesses includes the ongoing Waterbury Bucks gift certificate program holiday shopping promotions business networking events advertising visitor communications and promotions such as the Waterbury Adventure Challenge.

During a slide presentation Executive Director Karen Nevin announced that the board has developed an equity diversity and inclusion statement that will be incorporated into its ongoing work. The statement says: “We commit to help Waterbury be a place that is welcoming and accessible where people support and encourage each other where differences are valued and embraced and all voices are heard.”

Nevin said the ideas described in the statement are practical. “We believe that it's important to integrate our statement into our work” she said. The diversity principles will be reflected in efforts the organization undertakes she said such as a video marketing project this summer for which diverse models will be hired.

Two recently completed endeavors are a housing study and a retail market analysis the findings from which are just being shared with local government and business leaders and will be with the community as well Pomilio said.

Transforming Jack’s Alley

Looking ahead to 2022 plans are under way to beautify the alleyway on Stowe Street adjacent to Stowe Street Emporium. Improving the space for public use as a mini-park for music art and gatherings was something envisioned by Jack Carter former owner of the retail store and longtime Revitalizing Waterbury and community volunteer.

Carter died last June and since then Nevin said approximately $40000 in donations have been collected for the alley project “many in Jack’s honor” she said.

Outgoing Revitalizing Waterbury President Theresa Wood said Carter’s legacy fuels the momentum to transform the space. “We will complete this alley project because it was one of Jack’s dreams” she said.

The project needs town permits and design work is underway with plans to do the work in phases she said. Collaborators include Waterbury Rotary MakerSphere Waterbury Arts the American Legion Waterbury Historical Society and the property owners.

In addition to Carter the meeting presentation paid tribute to former RW member and longtime member of the local business community Stephen Van Esen who died in December. A public memorial will be held for him in May.

Looking ahead the annual Waterbury Arts Festival will return to its pre-pandemic time with dates set for July 8 and 9 board member Scott Weigand said. Due to new tent safety regulations however it will be moved to a new spot this year from Stowe Street and Bidwell Lane to the lawn at Pilgrim Park behind the train station. The event is Revitalizing Waterbury’s largest fundraiser each year. It will still feature a Friday night party and Saturday arts market food vendors and entertainment he said.

Organization Treasurer Dave Luce offered brief remarks on the nonprofit’s finances for the past year. The group’s financial statements are available online breaking down its approximate $300000 annual budget.

Brewer’s Crackers are available in two flavors: sea salt and everything.

In addition to flatbread crackers Brewer’s offers pita chips in sea salt and rosemary varieties.

Matthew Fiasconaro co-owner of Brewer’s Foods said the company was forced to halt production of flatbread crackers for eight months between April 2021 and December 2021. The shuttering was driven by several factors including strong demand that the company couldn’t keep pace with as well as COVID issues that affected staffing in the small bakery where the company was making its products.

“It was difficult because we worked so hard to get shelf space and (then had) to relinquish it back to competitors” Matthew Fiasconaro said. He said it took the company eight months to find the right partner that could grow with it long term and Brewer’s Foods is now baking in a larger facility.

The shift in production sites also gave the company the opportunity to create new more eco-friendly packaging. Prior to the relaunch the flatbread crackers were packaged in a plastic container. Now the crackers are using 90% less plastic.

“We hope we have put ourselves in a favorable position with consumers and buyers who are environmentally conscious and with lawmakers who are cracking down on single-use plastic” said Kyle Fiasconaro founder of Brewer’s Foods.

Brewer’s Crackers are available in Whole Foods Market stores in the North Atlantic and Northeast with plans to expand to the Mid-Atlantic. The company’s products also are available in other grocers specialty markets cheese shops and farm stands on the East Coast.",,,,,,,,,

BURLINGTON — Before the bus was free Bowie Bouchard would be more frugal getting around town.

If the 34-year-old needed to visit the University Mall for instance he’d shell out 75 cents for a bus ride to that South Burlington shopping center. On the return trip though he’d take his bike since the way home had fewer uphill climbs.

But with the advent of fare-free public transit — a pandemic-era subsidy extended by the state Legislature — Bouchard is more likely to take the bus whenever it’s more convenient he told VTDigger as he strapped his bike to the front of an outbound 6 bus Thursday morning.

Bouchard is not alone among regular Green Mountain Transit riders. By forgoing the once-common rituals of coughing up change or purchasing a monthly bus pass riders around Chittenden County and beyond are finding extra cash in their pocket.

“It’s helped me save $20 a month” said Rebecca Aberl 46 a New North End resident who rides the 7 bus to get groceries and attend medical appointments.

Yet other riders say the $1.7 million needed to sustain the program across the state for another year should be allocated toward making service more frequent.

Those calls have grown louder in areas served by Green Mountain Transit after the bus system recently announced service cuts in three of its routes as a cost-saving tactic. Officials initially said the cuts would be temporary but have since indicated they will become permanent.

Under the proposed changes the 6 bus (which runs up and down Route 7 also known as Shelburne Road) and 7 bus (which ferries passengers back and forth along North Avenue in Burlington) would run every half-hour instead of every 20 minutes during the week.

A commuter bus between Burlington and Montpelier would also run four fewer times a day since ridership on the route has dropped 30% during the pandemic officials said

But it’s the bus system’s weekend service on both Chittenden County routes that most troubles Bob Miller a 70-year-old Burlington resident. Miller takes the bus to work on Saturdays and some Sundays and the hour-and-a-quarter gap between buses on Sundays makes his commute less convenient.

While he appreciates fare-free Miller said he’d rather see public transit money fill service gaps such as the one he experiences on weekends.

Miller acknowledges that his situation is not universal. When he goes to work on Saturday mornings he’s sometimes the only one on board he said.

“I understand that that isn’t good economically” Miller said. “But it’s good for me.”

Miller was one of several riders who spoke to a VTDigger reporter on board the 6 and 7 buses Thursday morning. Another was Frederick Royce an 81-year-old resident at Heineberg Senior Housing in Burlington’s New North End.

Royce told VTDigger he wasn’t a fan of the service cuts since the bus is his only way to get downtown.

“It may mean that I won’t be able to do as much” he said.

Most but not all of the passengers who spoke to VTDigger relied on Green Mountain Transit buses as their primary mode of transportation.

The transit riders VTDigger spoke to who did own cars such as Burlington resident Damion Kristoo said they preferred fare-free service to more frequent availability. Kristoo got a lift on the bus Thursday to go pick up his truck from a repair shop.

Shelburne resident Malik Mines also owns a car but usually takes the bus to work. The 26-year-old likes fare-free service he said but not necessarily because it’s cheaper.

“It’s just more convenient to not dig for change or go buy a bus pass” Mines told VTDigger.

Some local transportation analysts argue that fare-free buses should remain for people such as Mines.

For Green Mountain Transit to boost its ridership to past pre-pandemic levels fare-free will be more effective in drawing new passengers than more frequent service said state Rep. Curt McCormack D-Burlington who sits on the House transportation committee and does not own a car.

Yet the argument between fare-free and more frequent service obscures a more fundamental issue — how Green Mountain Transit will manage to provide service at a time when fuel prices are outpacing the system’s effort to cut costs.

The planned service reductions for example are expected to save the transit service $250000 said Jon Moore Green Mountain Transit’s executive director. But if the recent spike in oil prices endures the company could be $400000 over its fuel budget in the upcoming year he said.

A study issued last year cites the transit system’s spotty funding as a source of its financial woes. The service receives most of its funds from towns that choose to chip in money rather than from a state fund.

But while a state fund would help stabilize the utility’s finances it would require towns that don’t benefit from Green Mountain Transit services to pay into it — a concept that doesn’t sit well with some state legislators.

Some riders who spoke to VTDigger on Thursday meanwhile said they wouldn’t mind if Green Mountain Transit reinstated fare collection.

One of them is Kimberly Clark a 46-year-old Burlington resident who said she rides the 7 bus every day. Clark bought a monthly pass the day before Green Mountain Transit went fare-free she said and has been dying to redeem her purchase.

“I’d rather pay the money” Clark told VTDigger. “I’ve been using a bus pass since 1999.”

While Green Mountain Transit officials say ridership is down across the system Clark sometimes struggles to find a spot on the 7 bus during the morning and midafternoons when Burlington High School students make an exodus from their new downtown learning space.

Burlington High School student Bailey Kingsbury 17 said Thursday morning she would like the bus system to prioritize fare-free service over more frequent buses.

Bill Worthen 81 agreed with her. The Burlington resident has been riding the bus every day for years and while he thinks the fares Green Mountain Transit used to offer were reasonable he would appreciate the continuation of fare-free service.

“It’s unbelievable” Worthen said. “How can you beat a free bus?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL2Fwci8wMy90b2lsZXQtcGFwZXItbWFrZXJzLXRyeS1nZXR0aW5nLWNvbnN1bWVycy10by1yb2xsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toilet-paper makers try getting consumers to roll with something new,"Early in the pandemic toilet paper shortages pushed weary Americans to the fringes.

Out of necessity millions tried rolls made from recycled paper or bamboo. And what they found surprised them. These alternatives were actually soft far from the sandpaper-ish versions they grudgingly used at their office or in a public restroom. That revelation is shaking up what had been a stable -- even boring -- category that racked up about $10 billion at U.S. retailers last year.

Purchase patterns for toilet paper have historically been simple and lucrative: Shoppers found a brand like Charmin and bought it like clockwork every few weeks for years even decades. But all those empty shelves made shoppers reconsider a product they had rarely given a second thought. That opened them up to emerging brands -- some backed by venture capital -- making claims about softness similar to those that had dominated the category for half a century while adding a benefit for this era: saving the planet.

""Supply shortages forced consumers to become more experimental"" said Jamie Rosenberg associate director of global household and personal care for researcher Mintel Group. ""Often that meant trying eco-niche products for the first time.""

In one telling example Cloud Paper a startup founded in 2019 that counts Jeff Bezos and Robert Downey Jr. as investors saw its core business of supplying companies dry up early in the pandemic but then shifted to selling its ""tree-free"" bamboo option directly to consumers on the web. Revenue boomed and the company has since shipped more than 2 million rolls across America.

Now these alternatives need to show they can sustain that momentum as covid-19 fades and the masses return to some normalcy and possibly their old ways. In-store sales of toilet paper surged at the beginning of the pandemic but have since slowed according to data from NielsenIQ. And options deemed sustainable have retreated even faster. However the figures don't capture a lot of the purchases from these startups because they mostly sell online directly to consumers.

""There are those people who buy recycled tissue paper because they want to advance the environment"" said Martin Wolf director of sustainability at Seventh Generation a Unilever brand that offers eco-friendly paper products. Then there is ""the much larger group of people who want something that's very soft very strong.""

And therein lies the challenge with products pitching sustainability: Their growth is capped if they can't win over consumers beyond the group that already places a high premium on what's deemed good for the environment. In surveys majorities of consumers will often say they care about climate change or being green but in reality that only goes so far.

To convert the masses these brands need to get close to the real thing. History shows that to truly upend a category a product needs to meet the basic requirements of the consumer before being considered. Diet soda needed to taste like soda. Plant-based burgers didn't become meaningful until they got closer to mimicking beef.

The U.S. toilet paper industry revolves around softness with giant brands engaging in a decades-long marketing battle over touch and feel. In the 1960s Procter & Gamble broke through with a long-running TV campaign featuring a supermarket manager who tried to get housewives to resist squeezing the Charmin because it was so soft. Georgia-Pacific pitched ""pillows of softness"" for Quilted Northern. And Kimberly-Clark's Cottonelle created the tagline: ""Of course it isn't cotton but it is cottony soft.""

The sector has since tried to add benefit stories around infusing toilet paper with lotion or scents like lavender. Lately it looks like the industry is running out of ideas with a recent push to make rolls fluffier and market them as ""mega.""

But the baseline remains softness and recycled toilet paper which has been around for more than two decades has generally fallen short on that front. Reclaimed tissue makers work with fibers that are shorter because they get damaged during the recycling process so they yield tissue that's not as smooth. It's possible to make up some of that soft feel consumers want but not all according to Seventh Generation's Wolf.

In 2020 recycled toilet paper accounted for just 1.6% of sales from U.S. retailers while the big three - P&G Kimberly-Clark and Georgia-Pacific -- controlled 70% of the market according to Euromonitor International. A look at reviews on Seventh Generation's website shows why. Customers no doubt like that the recycled toilet paper is eco-friendly but one emblematic comment simply states: ""It is not very soft but doing its job.""

Upstart bamboo brands are now trying to make the case that they are just as soft or coming really close while layering on messaging that says they are fighting deforestation that hurts the environment. On its website Cloud Paper says the equivalent of 40000 trees are cut down per day for traditional toilet paper and paper towels.

Who Gives a Crap which sells recycled and bamboo options touts in a cheeky online commercial that people who care about the environment won't settle for ""regular toilet paper"" while ticking off similar stats about lost trees. It then adds the selling point that could be the big unlock: ""Eco-friendly toilet paper doesn't have to feel scratchy.""

Shortly after its founding in 2012 Who Gives a Crap realized it needed to match the quality of traditional offerings. Otherwise it would struggle to get beyond ""crunchy hippies"" according to Danny Alexander a co-founder and chief of product. The brand began with a recycled line and added a bamboo option in 2016 because the plant which is classified as a grass has longer fibers that made the tissue softer. Using bamboo also avoided the psychological baggage recycled options might have already inflicted.

A lot of people ""aren't willing to try it again"" Alexander said.

Grove Collaborative a startup selling eco-friendly goods with about $385 million in annual revenue and a valuation of around $1.5 billion churned through half a dozen versions of its bamboo toilet paper in pursuit of softness. One big leap was making it completely from bamboo fibers instead of mixing in sugarcane. Simplifying the inputs made upgrades easier and each improvement increased sales according to Grove Chief Executive Officer Stuart Landesberg.

""Price matters. Packaging matters. Story matters"" Landesberg said. ""But ultimately quality matters probably most especially in this category.""

Bamboo toilet paper makers have also narrowed the gap on cost -- another common hurdle for brands pitching sustainability. Grove furled its rolls tighter boosting how much tissue it fits onto each roll and reducing shipping costs. Cloud Paper began offering bulk orders of 96 rolls which helped cut the number of deliveries.

In a Bloomberg analysis some bamboo offerings are about the same price as those from major brands made with virgin trees. Cloud Paper's 24-pack comes out to roughly 40 cents per hundred sheets about the same cost as Charmin's ultra soft offering of the same size. Bamboo options are now sold by major retailers including Walmart Target and Amazon.

Brands pitching sustainability have also benefited from environmental groups pressuring the industry. In 2019 the Natural Resources Defense Council sparked media coverage with a report titled: ""The Issue With Tissue: How Americans Are Flushing Forests Down the Toilet.""

The advocacy organization accused the big brands of not doing more to shift away from using virgin wood pulp that was being harvested from trees cut down in places like the boreal forest in Canada which according to NRDC estimates removes in a year the carbon dioxide equivalent to the emissions of 24 million cars.

Alexander the Who Gives a Crap executive sums up his side's criticism like this: ""It's just a really poor use of resources. The thought of walking through a forest seeing a tree and thinking: 'You know I should wipe my bum with that.' It's pretty ludicrous.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZXJpZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wc29tMDE4Mzc3NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ralph E. Clark Obituary,"Let the family know you are thinking of them

The world lost a beloved husband father grandfather and friend on March 31 2022 when Ralph E. Clark passed away peacefully at St. Vincent Hospital.

Ralph Clark was born to Leo and Iva Clark on July 21 1938 the fourth of 12 children raised in the scenic mountains of Clearfield Pa.

Ralph often said he had the best childhood whiling away the hours hunting fishing and wrestling with his many siblings.

At Clearfield High School Ralph won the District and Regional wrestling titles all four years. In both 1955 and 1956 he won the PIAA State Championship title. As he moved on to Lock Haven University Ralph became a four-time State College Champion and a two-time NAIA Champion. In 1960 Ralph placed third in the nation in the NCAA Division I-A Championship held at the University of Maryland. Ralph is currently in both the Lock Haven University Wrestling Hall of Fame and the PA Wrestling Coaches Association (PWCA) Hall of Fame.

At Lock Haven Ralph met the love of his life Faye Marsh and they married. Ralph and Faye moved to Erie where Ralph taught Driver’s Education at McDowell High School for the next 32 years. Generations of McDowell students remember learning to drive with the patient instruction (and occasional joke) of “Mr. Clark.” Ralph also coached varsity wrestling for 18 years. His wrestlers respected Coach Clark and his well-known mottos such as “When the going gets tough the tough get going.”

Ralph will always be remembered for his quick wit and love of a good laugh (and a great steak). He loved his career and often said he would not change a thing about the life he has lived. Ralph spent some of his happiest times at “Camp” in Clearfield hunting with his brothers and close friends. In addition Ralph spent many memorable summers on the shores of Presque Isle including his summers as a Presque Isle State Park Police Officer. Also Ralph always spoke fondly of the afternoons and early evenings on his boat sitting next to his wife with the wind in his hair driving the boat as his daughters (and their friends) water skied in the reflection of the setting sun.

As time marched on Ralph fished with his grandchildren and taught them to bait their own hooks. He also spent hours hunting with his grandsons and teaching them the inner workings of motorcycles – especially a particular red Suzuki.

Ralph E. Clark is survived by his wife of 59 years Faye Clark (Marsh); his daughter Kimberly Klein (Chip); his daughter Melissa Visosky (Thomas); his granddaughters Alyssa and Alexa Raymond; and his grandsons Jason and Ryan Visosky.

He is also survived by his sisters Twila Tubbs Kathryn Rebecca (Becky) Biondi (Daniel); Delores Hummel (Daniel); Vivian Pownell (Dalton); his sister-in-law Dana Clark (David); and his brothers Marvin Clark (Nancy); Walter Clark and Daniel Clark (Coleen). Ralph also leaves to cherish his memory many loving nieces and nephews.

Ralph was preceded in death by his sister Marygail Clark his brothers David Clark (Dana) Jack Clark (Mary) and Samuel Clark; and his brother-in-law Gary Tubbs (Twila)

The family would like to thank the following nurses at Saint Vincent Hospital for their kind and compassionate care: Meghan Chanda Jackie Jeanine and Delaney. You are angels on earth.

Friends and family will be received at noon on Sunday April 10 2022 until 1:30 p.m. at the Dusckas-Martin Funeral Home and Crematory Inc. 4216 Sterrettania Road Erie Pa.

Ralph’s Celebration of Life will begin at 1:30 p.m. All are welcome to stay celebrate him with us and perhaps say a few words. If Ralph were here right now with us he would say “It’s time to go hunting!”

In lieu of flowers donations may be made to McDowell Wrestling Boosters and sent to Dusckas-Martin Funeral Home Inc. 4216 Sterrettania Road Erie PA 16506.",,,

Zero Hunger l Zero Waste is saving food to help families in need. Smith’s grocery store management donates unsold food to help families in the community.

“A lot of people aren’t aware of what Smith's processes look like” said Aubriana Martindale division of corporate affairs manager. “We have very strict operation guidelines. Smiths is certainly the business of food. We know that meals have the power of bringing people together. It's what we do at the end of the day we gather at the table and enjoy a meal. There are studies showing that children who have meals at the end of the day do better in all aspects of their life; they have better attendance and get better grades etc.”

Zero Hunger’s Mission Statement is: “We are on a mission to help communities free of hunger and waste.”

“There is a fundamental absurdity in our food system; 35% of the food produced in the U.S. is thrown away yet an estimated 42 million Americans struggle with hunger” Martindale said. “We can help. Kroger’s Zero Hunger l Zero Waste social and environmental impact or commitment is to help create a more efficient and equitable food and charitable food system.”

Martindale discussed more of why this program is so important.

“One in seven Utah children don’t know where their next meal is coming from” she said. “When we think of hunger we don’t necessarily think of it right in our neighborhoods. Hunger is hard to identify; it doesn’t discriminate against age gender or race. What commonly happens when families are food insecure and money is tight they will spend their funds to cover the cost of the mortgage cover the cost of their car to get to their job or from place to place. The last item they will check off is food. They will utilize food-assistance programs.”

Martindale said officials at Smith’s understand the need to help out.

“When Smith’s heard that one in seven Utah children don't know where their next meal is coming from Smith’s felt they had an obligation to address the need of seeing that Utah children are fed” Martindale said. “They show up to school with a hungry stomach and they can’t concentrate on their education. That doesn’t set them up for success.”

In delving into the reasons for hunger Smith’s management found that 40% of food produced in the U.S. goes wasted.

“How to get more of the food in homes versus it goes to the landfill” Martindale said.

Smith’s management stepped up to the operation of Zero Hunger Zero Waste to address the hunger problem. By 2025 the Smith's goal is to eliminate the waste program and help end hunger.

Shoppers hold their standards to high-fresh products. Smith’s holds itself to high standards with fresh products. Associates rotate the produce every day. Smith’s has a red bag program and put blemished items to be marked down the same day and sold. If it is not sold the same day when it was put in the red bag then food is donated to the food bank. The food bank will turn the food over to a family the same day or the next day.

There is an unrealistic perspective of food.

“We think food needs to look perfect to be human consumable; that is not the case” Martindale said. “We know that if an apple has a blemish we can easily peel off the skin the apple is still nourishing and good for a child especially if the child has not had an apple all week long. Both perishable and non-perishable goes through different processes. Any food that is no longer sellable but is still human consumable is donated to the food bank. The food bank gets it out to the community.”

The food bank has different programs and pairs with partnering pantries. Clients pick up the food and it gets distributed to the schools.

When the “Good Samaritan Act” came out food bank officials could see that hunger was a big issue. Organizations wanting to help with solving hunger were donating food in good faith. Zero Hunger Zero Waste donates everything it can. The food bank evaluates all the food before it gets sent out to its clients. The food bank is part of Feeding America; they conduct audits and lets everyone know there are required regulations. The food bank has a list of items that says how far the items can be used and how far the items can go past the dates listed on the product. Smith’s only goes by the “sell by dates” when rotating the items on the shelves. When products go past the sell by date they are pulled from the shelf and are sent to their reclaim process then donated to the food bank. The food bank makes sure they evaluate all products before they get into anybody's hands.

“In our homes we need to consider how much quantity of food we need” Martindale said. “Do we cook in excess and are we throwing things out that could be donated? Are we composting? Food waste releases one of the worst gasses it is methane gas. However we can recycle food that is the best option rather than hitting the landfill.”

There is an anaerobic-digester located in North Salt Lake. Any food that is no longer human consumable that can’t be donated. Smith’s officials still want to divert as much waste from hitting the landfill as possible. Any food that can’t be donated to the food bank Smith’s will donate to the anaerobic-digester. The anaerobic-digester is a process that microorganisms break down biodegradable material that doesn’t have any oxygen. The process is used for industrial and domestic purposes.

Their three-year contract which covers workers at 540 stores expired on March 6 and on March 27 the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) announced that a strike authorization vote across the seven locals covered under the contract had returned 95 percent of ballots cast in favor of authorizing an unfair labor practice strike. The UFCW has filed claims with the National Labor Relations Board alleging employer intimidation harassment surveillance and illegally influencing workers during negotiations accusations that the companies deny.

The stores are Albertsons Vons Pavilions and Ralphs comprising two of the country’s largest supermarket chains — Albertsons owns Vons and Pavilion while Kroger owns Ralphs. Bargaining has been ongoing since late January with the two sides meeting today but workers are now prepared to walk out if need be. Should they walk off the job it would be the largest strike since the pre-pandemic teachers’ strikes and the largest private-sector strike since seventy-four thousand UAW members struck General Motors in 2007.

“Bargaining committees composed of front-line grocery workers and union leaders came prepared with proposals that would fairly increase wages and improve store conditions to reflect the needs of workers in a pandemic and post-pandemic world” the UFCW said in a statement earlier this month. “The corporations representing the stores offered pennies a proposal that would ultimately be a pay cut due to inflation.”

Wages are a key point of disagreement. The union is pushing for significant wage increases for workers who have kept the stores running through two years of the pandemic but it says the employers have only offered a 60-cent-per-year hourly increase amounting to a $1.80-an-hour raise by the end of the contract.

As the Los Angeles Times reports the union is seeking a $5 hourly raise by the end of the new contract for the highest-paid senior workers — food clerks which include cashiers and shelf stockers who comprise around one-third of the workforce and currently make $22.50 an hour after five to seven years at the job. The union seeks to raise wages by $8 an hour by the end of the contract for general merchandising clerks who currently make a maximum of $17.02 an hour arguing that they do comparable work to the higher-paid employees. For these workers the companies have offered a $2-an-hour raise. It is unclear how much the companies will offer for baggers and clerk’s helpers the lowest-paid third of the workforce who currently make just above California’s $15-an-hour minimum wage.

Sufficient staffing and more predictable scheduling are other worker priorities as are health and safety — grocery store staff have been hit particularly hard by COVID-19 with an estimated 7709 Local 770 members contracting the illness and a mass shooting in 2021 at a Kroger-owned King Soopers in Colorado has made safety committees a demand as well. The companies have thus far rejected proposals concerning worker safety and minimum staffing guarantees.

“These companies can either come to the table ready to negotiate a fair deal or we’re going to have to take this fight elsewhere” Kathy Finn secretary-treasurer of UFCW Local 770 in Los Angeles and a lead negotiator told the Los Angeles Times. A strike was also authorized in 2019 during the previous round of contract negotiations but the two sides reached an agreement without a work stoppage.

Ralphs has responded to the strike threat by attempting to hire temporary workers vowing to remain open should workers walk off the job. One TikTok user created a script to flood the company’s hiring portal with fake job applications — he told the Los Angeles Times that twenty-five thousand such submissions went through and the page no longer appears to be active. “It’s disappointing that these failed attempts were aimed at disrupting [a community’s] access to fresh food and essential items” a Ralphs representative told the paper.

The fight comes at a time when tensions between grocery-store workers and their employers are particularly heightened. Pandemic-era rhetoric casting cashiers as “essential” plays a role in leading workers to fight back for dignity they feel they are denied on the job and eight thousand UFCW Local 7 members who work at Kroger-owned stores in Colorado just went on strike earlier this year.

Also relevant is a recent report detailing the sorry state of Kroger’s massive workforce. The country’s fourth-largest private employer Kroger offers such poor wages and benefits that 14 percent of the Kroger employees surveyed for the report have been homeless in the past year 36 percent worry about eviction and more than three-quarters meet the US Department of Agriculture’s definition of “food insecure.” The findings are based on a survey of more than ten thousand of the company’s employees some of them the very workers in Southern California who are preparing to strike.

Even as Kroger’s profits skyrocket — its operating profits nearly doubled between 2019 and 2021 — the company has been particularly unwilling to offer additional pay to the people who staff its stores. When Los Angeles and Long Beach passed ordinances mandating hazard pay for grocery-store workers the company closed five locations. It claimed these stores were financially unsustainable but the action had all the markings of a capital strike — an employer preferring to shutter locations entirely rather than hike worker pay. Meanwhile Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen made $22.4 million in 2020.

“Rodney McMullen can afford helicopters and yachts and I will be homeless when my parents die” wrote one King Soopers clerk in the recent survey of Kroger workers. Or as one Vons employee told the Los Angeles Times “We know they’ve made billions in profits and we’re not afraid to go out. There’s a big change coming.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRjdG1kLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RhaWxvcmVkLW51dHJpdGlvbi1hZHZpY2UtZ3JvY2VyeS1zdG9yZS13b3Jrcy1zdXBlcndpbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tailored Nutrition Advice at the Grocery Store Works: SuperWIN,"The study is “intriguing” says Athena Poppas but whether the results will broadly apply—or last—remains to be seen.

WASHINGTON DC—(UPDATED) Coaching individuals on-site at the supermarket can help them adhere to a healthier diet even more so when such education is accompanied by training on how to use digital tools like shopping apps researchers have found.

The trial known as Supermarket and Web-based Intervention targeting Nutrition (SuperWIN) took place at 13 Kroger grocery stores in the Cincinnati OH metropolitan area. Kroger the largest supermarket chain in the United States partially funded the study and provided additional support including clinic space and equipment.

Dylan Steen (Source ACC)

Dylan L. Steen MD (University of Cincinnati Medical Center OH) who presented the late-breaking results today at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 2022 Scientific Session told TCTMD that the study is a unique collaboration between academic researchers and retail.

The goal he said was “to try to understand how we could change dietary education by utilizing supermarkets supermarket-employed dieticians who also have an expertise on the full food inventory and the purchasing data which the retailers have been collecting for decades but which could be refined for healthcare purposes.” They also wanted to see how newly available technologies could aid in the effort.

Retail spaces are a new means of connecting patients with healthcare said Steen. “These companies sit embedded within the fabric of every community. And the reality is they’re convenient accessible incredibly customer-centric—there’s a lot in healthcare we could learn from how they deliver [their products]. And they have enormous data abilities as well.”

Having data on when and where people are eating allows for personalized nutrition advice he added. “So if someone was eating on the road in the morning stopping at McDonald’s every day the dietician knew that and could say ‘Let me find you something—I get it. You can’t make breakfast at home [so] let’s get something where you can take it in the car with you but it’s healthy.’” SuperWIN’s advice encouraged the DASH diet taking into account food preferences as well as budget said Steen.

Athena Poppas MD (Lifespan Cardiovascular Institute and Brown University Providence RI) immediate past president of the ACC said it’s no surprise to see that the interventions worked. SuperWIN she told TCTMD supports the argument for team-based care.

Physicians sitting down with patients “broadcasting in 10 minutes all of that level of detail” isn’t enough Poppas said. A registered dietician “really does know a lot more than the 3 hours of nutrition that I got in medical school or the [knowledge] I try to stay up on.”

Moreover it’s important to meet patients where they are whether that’s pharmacies and drugstores or at church for instance. “We saw it with the barbershop study in the past that other settings may be more comfortable and more impactful” she stressed adding that it’s good “do something tangible” as they did here walking around a supermarket discussing nutrition rather than just reading through educational materials.

It’s crucial to come at the issue of nutrition advice from a new angle “because whatever we’ve been trying to do has not been as effective” Poppas stressed.

SuperWIN

For SuperWIN Steen and colleagues screened 486 patients in a university-based primary care network. Some of these individuals were unwilling or unable to modify their diets didn’t want to be randomized or didn’t complete the necessary first steps and thus didn’t continue in the study. Ultimately the researchers enrolled 267 participants (median age 58 years; 69% women) with one or more CVD risk factors. Between April 2019 and February 2021 they were randomized 1:2:2 to receive:

Control: standard-of-care medical nutrition therapy (30 minutes)

Strategy 1: the medical nutrition therapy (30 minutes) plus individualized point-of-purchase education on nutrition (six hour-long sessions)

Strategy 2: the above interventions plus stepwise training in the use of technologies like online shopping

The educational sessions were conducted at each participant’s preferred store in the clinic or aisles. Twenty patients ultimately dropped out due to the COVID-19 pandemic leaving 247 for analysis. Around three-quarters were white married or living with a partner and working full-time. Most were obese. Approximately four in 10 were on cholesterol-lowering drugs while seven in 10 were on antihypertensives.

Notably said Steen 99% of patients given strategy 1 or 2 attended through the full intervention in the non-COVID era. In the pandemic attendance still was around 80%.

Changes in diet were measured by DASH score which reflects how well people are adhering to DASH-recommended servings for grains vegetables fruits dairy meat/poultry/fish/eggs nuts/seeds/legumes fats/oils sweets and sodium. The score is measured on a scale of 0-90 with higher scores representing better diets.

At baseline DASH scores were 45.2 44.4 and 43.2. Between baseline and 3 months all three study arms saw their DASH scores improve: by 5.8 points in controls by 8.6 points with added education and by 12.4 points with added education plus technology training. Together strategies 1 and 2 increased DASH score by 4.7 points compared with standard of care (P = 0.02) and strategy 2 with the addition of technology training outperformed strategy 1 (P = 0.01). Within the subgroup of 109 pre-COVID patients the education increased DASH score by an even greater degree by 8.3 points (P = 0.001).

At 6 months the advantages seen with strategies 1 and 2 versus the control where no longer significant. However speaking with TCTMD Steen called attention to the within-group improvements from baseline. These were mostly sustained up through 6 months he said.

Poppas called the SuperWIN results “intriguing” but she said that the question is how long the new habits will last.

Another issue she raised is whether there will be universal appeal for patients. Some of the initial 496 people screened for participation did not take part Poppas pointed out so those who did opt in were “a motivated group.” Generally speaking the study population tended to be young female white and employed. And when thinking about health equity “food deserts” could be a real-world obstacle she noted and fresh vegetables and fruit can be costly.

As to what should come next Steen said he hopes SuperWIN sparks conversations about new collaborations that can “help the modern healthcare system evolve.”

Eileen Handberg PhD (University of Florida Gainesville) discussing the findings after Steen’s presentation agreed that “this is an important paradigm shift in nutrition lifestyle intervention.” She too pointed out that these participants were a “relatively affluent educated group going to a Kroger. . . . So how do you see this playing out in a more underserved population whose grocery stores may be totally different from the Kroger model?”

Steen noting that one-third of households had annual incomes exceeding $125000 said “It’s a great question.” He pointed out that the US government’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is looking at whether online tools home delivery and other resources might alleviate some of the barriers to dietary intake. “In the future we probably need a bigger study in more communities” said Steen adding “I think if we do a broader more generalizable study we could get at that question. But the opportunity is certainly there” with smartphones and healthcare apps proliferating across society.

ACC Program Chair Pamela Morris MD (Medical University of South Carolina Charleston who co-moderated the session asked if Kroger had a commitment to ongoing education at their stores: “How do we finance and how do we make this extend long-term beyond just a short clinical trial?”

Retail-based healthcare is on the rise irrespective of SuperWIN said Steen. To create sustainable programs “having the evidence base will be critically important. I used to have a mentor who said ‘If you can show the data you can find the dollars.’ So I think validation is an enormous part of this evolution . . .  not only to figure out what works best but also to engage payers and others in the process of supporting these types of interventions” he stressed adding “Research is going to be a huge part of cementing that in and helping us understand what we should do for whom.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRuai5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA0LzAzL2FsZGktYWRkcy1mb3VydGgtc3RvcmUtcnV0aGVyZm9yZC1jb3VudHktdGVubmVzc2VlLzcyNTUxNTQwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aldi adds fourth store to Rutherford County Tennessee.,"Aldi is getting serious about groceries in Rutherford County.

The supermarket chain is scheduled on April 14 to open its fourth area store — 3439 South Church Street in Murfreesboro. The store will be open daily from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.

The location is walking distance from a Walmart Supercenter and a short drive from a Kroger location signaling Aldi's aggressive expansion plan. Aldi is aiming to become the third-largest U.S. grocery retailer by store count by the end of 2022.

That goal would place the chain behind Kroger and Walmart.

""We have served this community for more than 15 years and are excited to continue to offer Murfreesboro residents an affordable way of shopping"" said Amy Peters Mt. Juliet regional vice president for ALDI.

Aldi has local stores on Robert Rose Drive and Memorial Blvd. in Murfreesboro and one on Lowry Street in Smyrna.

The new Aldi location will be the anchor tenant for The Marketplace at Savannah Ridge a new shopping center at the corner of Joe B. Jackson Parkway and South Church Street.

“It’s going to completely transform a previously untouched area in the city and we hope it’ll be a catalyst for other development around it"" Steelhead Building Group Principal James Pollard told The Daily News Journal in April 2021 as the construction company kicked off building the 24-acre retail development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtjdXIub3JnLzIwMjItMDQtMDEvZm9vZC1wcmljZXMtd2lsbC1zZWUtYmlnZ2VzdC1pbmNyZWFzZS1pbi0xNC15ZWFycy1hY2NvcmRpbmctdG8tbWlzc291cmktcmVzZWFyY2hlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Food prices will see biggest increase in 14 years according to Missouri researchers,"Food prices will be a lot higher this year according to a new study of the agriculture and food industry.

According to the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute a think tank at the University of Missouri food prices will be at least 5% higher in 2022 compared to last year. That’s the biggest single year increase in 14 years.

The group’s director Pat Westhoff said the final number could be even higher.

“I won’t give you a specific number but it’s safe to say that if we were creating a new baseline today we’d almost certainly show a higher rate” said Westhoff who heads the institute.

While prices will be up across the board Westhoff said some foods will see especially high prices.

“We have seen much larger increases year over year for meats for fats and oils and for fresh fruits than you did for most other products” he said.

Labor costs fuel prices supply chain problems and the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are all partially to blame the increases. Those same problems are at the heart of the overall inflation rate according to economists.

Westhoff said while prices are higher no one in food production will be getting richer.

“For example at the farm level yes farmers are getting higher prices for the commodities that they sell but they are also paying more for fertilizer fuel and for other inputs” Westhoff said. “And so the net income picture for farmers may not be terribly different this year from what it was last year.”

Westhoff said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will also likely have long-lasting effects on food prices lengthening the amount of time before food inflation rates get back to normal. The average increase in food prices over the past two decades has been 2.5%.

“We've got that perfect storm right now” Debbie Boyd DLB Financial Services CEO recently told Yahoo Live (video above). “We've got COVID that did the supply chain problems … COVID that drove people to work from home. They're moving to states where their families are or they're just moving to states that are prettier and they want to be in. Now that you can work anywhere it really has changed the game of employment.”

At the same time record low inventory levels have continued to push home prices and competition in the housing market higher. Homebuilders like Lennar and Toll Brothers have lagged behind amid supply chain crunches. Together these factors have led to the worst affordability conditions for entry level buyers this year according to Bank of America analysts.

The national home price index escalated by 19.2% year-over-year in January up from 18.9% in December according to the latest Standard & Poor’s CoreLogic Case-Shiller report. The sharp increase in home prices across the U.S. counters the modest deceleration seen in previous months.

Now rising mortgage prices are now adding to the headwinds.

“The prices going up are one thing another thing is those interest rates” Boyd said. “So when the interest rates go up it's not going to deter you from buying. If you're going to move you're going to move.”

Many Americans are flocking to sunshine states reaping the savings of work-from-home flexibility. According to the S&P/Case Shiller home index report the three hottest markets in January included Phoenix Tampa and Miami which registered home price growth of 32% 30% and 28% respectively.

“I'm here in Dallas and we have a lot of people moving from everywhere — everywhere else but here … Chicago Atlanta New York Boston and then we've got the West Coast” Boyd said. “We've got people from Washington that are cashing in those expensive homes and buying twice what they can buy up in Washington or in California pocketing the money and investing it or buying rental properties.”

Story continues

Entering the year many buyers rushed to take advantage of 3.1% December mortgage rates ahead of further rises. Since then the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage has increased more than a full point at 4.42% for the week ending March 25 according to Freddie Mac.

Redfin data showed that homebuyers were paying up to six figures above asking price in an effort to beat other bidders as homes on the market remained scarce. January was the most competitive month on record with 70% of home offers written by company agents up against bidding wars. At the time the median home-sale price was $376200 up 14% from the previous year.

According to Boyd rising home prices coupled with rising rates will impact how much house you can afford.

“You're going to get less house now than you could last year by quite a bit of percentage. So yes can you move to Miami proper? Maybe not. Maybe you can't afford to be in the city now. The prices are 30% more than they were last year. So you're going to be in the suburbs of Miami” said Boyd. “It's going to change the way that we live.”

The sharp increase in home prices may calm down but it will take time. The Federal Reserve indicated it would raise its benchmark interest rate up to six more times this year to tamp down inflation. These actions eventually can help push home prices to self-regulate if rates get high enough.

“I think it will cool off in a little while but not any time soon” said Boyd. “I think this year we're going to see close to 6%.”

Olly Murs welcomeed back the six heat winners for the grand final of ITV show ‘Starstruck’ last night. Each contestant transforms into their musical icon for one last time in a bid to win the coveted £50000 prize. Freddie Mercury Cher Tina Turner and Billie Eilish impersonators will take to the stage hoping to impress the judges and crucially the audience that decides the winner. The judges for the series have been Adam Lambert — lead vocalist for Queen since 2011 — alongside Sheridan Smith Jason Manford and Beverley Knight.

The live final aired at 8:30pm last night on ITV. Upon the show’s culmination Adam will undoubtedly be returning to his Queen bandmates in preparation for this summer’s 36-date European tour including a staggering 10 nights at London’s O2 Arena. Adam has collaborated with Queen for 11 years now embarking on world tours with Brian May and Co since 2014. Brian and Adam gave an honest assessment of how things work between the bandmates in a 2014 interview at the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards. Brian said: “We’re a proper band people regard us that way and I’m very happy that they do. READ MORE: Elvis Presley: Disney star 'wanted to hear Elvis confess his love'

Adam Lambert first collaborated with Queen in 2011.

The band embark on an enormous European tour later this year.

“It’s a great arrangement. I don’t know if it’s a marriage but it’s a very good affair.” Following in Freddie Mercury’s footsteps was an impossible task for anyone and Adam was asked how he puts his own stamp on the iconic songs. He said: “That was the biggest challenge finding that middle ground the balance between paying respect and not straying too far from these iconic recordings and Freddie’s amazing vocals on these originals not going too far from them but not imitating them either. “It’s been difficult it’s been trial and error in some respects.” He added: “You can feel [the audience] when they’re with you when they’re not with you.”

Adam opened up on the 'challenge' of following in Freddie Mercury's footsteps.

Trending

The band’s first international album ‘Live Around the World’ was released in October 2020 and topped the album charts in the UK and Australia. Their ongoing success Adam said is down to the openness of the original band members. He explained: “It wouldn’t be what it was if they weren’t so warm and inviting and open to things it’s been a full collaboration. “It could have gone a very different way and been a terrifying experience for me. “Brian and Roger and the rest of the crew have made me feel so welcome.” DON'T MISS:

Both Adam and the original band members make it clear he is not replacing the late great Freddie.

Brian added that Adam has tried to put his own stamp on the band without trying to merely be a Freddie Mercury impersonator. Like the previous project with Paul Rodgers the band made clear that Adam would not be replacing the legendary Freddie but instead he would feature alongside the band’s active members. Brian said: “He’s never arrogant he’s always respectful. He’s always looking for the right way to do things. “He doesn’t need to pretend to be Freddie in any sense but there are a lot of parallels between the two guys.” He added: “Adam’s interactive in every way. When we started putting the setlist together Adam came in and said ‘I need to do this and this and this’ and ‘Let’s look at this’.

“It was very interactive from the beginning and we’re very respectful of him. “He is a phenomenal artist so I feel very very lucky.” Despite the success the band have faced some setbacks particularly when considering writing new music. In a recent interview with Mojo magazine the band’s drummer Roger Taylor said: “We started it in Nashville when we were all quite tired. “We couldn’t decide on a title and the lyrics felt a little too negative for Queen maybe.”",,,,,,

U.S. Coast Guard

ARLINGTON Va. — The 500th C-130J Super Hercules aircraft built by Lockheed Martin (Booth 1001) has been delivered to its customer the company announced March 15.

The aircraft Lockheed Martin C-130 construction number 5934 is a C-130J-30 version that was delivered to the 130th Airlift Wing a unit of the West Virginia Air National Guard based at McLaughlin Air National Guard Base in Charleston West Virginia. The wing is replacing its older C-130 Hercules aircraft with new C-130J-30s.

The C-130J Super Hercules represents a significant advancement in performance technology and airlift capability over the older C-130 Hercules family of aircraft. The C-130J is equipped with the more powerful Rolls-Royce AE 2100D3 turboprop engines six-bladed GE-Dowty R391 composite propellers modern avionics and mission systems. The Super Hercules features dual head-up displays an integrated defensive suite automated maintenance fault reporting and a rear ramp door capable of opening at airspeeds of up to 250 knots. It has greater speed range lift capacity climb rate cruise altitude and short-field performance than the legacy C-130.

The C-130J Super Hercules is the current production model of the legendary C-130 Hercules aircraft. The C-130J first flew in 1996 and entered service in 1999. It is now the airlift aircraft of choice of 26 operators in 22 nations.

The U.S. military services operate the largest C-130J Super Hercules fleet in the world. The U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard collectively operate C-130J C-130J-30 AC-130J Ghostrider EC-130J Commando Solo HC-130J Combat King II MC-130J Commando II and WC-130J Weatherbird variants. The Marine Corps operates the KC-130J tanker version and a C-130J as part of the Blue Angels Flight Demonstration Team. The Coast Guard operates a version of the HC-130J which is different than the version used by the Air Force for search rescue and logistics. The U.S. Navy is planning to test a version of the C-130J-30 for the Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) strategic communications mission.

These are some of the 17 different mission configurations of the C-130J used worldwide for transport (military and commercial) humanitarian aid delivery aerial firefighting natural disaster relief support medevac search and rescue special operations fire support weather reconnaissance atmospheric research and aerial refueling.

The C-130J-30 is a version of the Super Hercules which has an extended fuselage (15 feet or 4.6 meters) when compared to the basic C-130J. As such it can carry 30% more passengers and cargo than the basic C-130J and 50% more container delivery system bundles.

The rugged C-130 family of aircraft has been in serial production longer than any other military aircraft in the U.S. inventory. The first C-130A made its first flight in 1954 and entered service in 1956. Since the first C-130 rolled of the Lockheed Martin production line more than 2100 were built before production switched to the C-130J. It is flown out of more than 70 nations and has been certified to support upwards of 100 different mission capabilities in its lifetime.



“No aircraft in history production or operation matches the C-130 Hercules in terms of its versatility. The C-130J both extends and expands this reputation thanks to increased speed integration and strength” said Rob Toth director of Business Development for Lockheed Martin’s Air Mobility and Maritime Missions line of business.



As a retired U.S. Air Force Special Operations MC-130H navigator Toth has experience flying and commanding operations with both legacy and C-130J aircraft.



“The legacy Hercs were great aircraft. The C-130J offers a more enhanced flying experience especially with the advanced situational awareness and added power” he said. “You the value of those attributes across all mission scenarios especially with the maritime patrol search and rescue special operations and aerial refueling requirements supported by the U.S. Marine Corps and Coast Guard.”



To date the Navy is the only U.S. government operator to not have a J in its fleet. Currently the Navy flies C-130s for transport and for 20 years (1963-1993) on the TACAMO missions.



Lockheed Martin is honored to have the Super Hercules selected for TACAMO testing — possibly bringing it back to where it all began Toth said.



“We are working closely with NAVAIR to support an aggressive acquisition strategy that prioritizes both speed of acquisition and affordability to accelerate recapitalization of one of our nation’s most important capabilities — survivable reliable and endurable communications between the president and the nation’s nuclear forces” Toth adds. “We are proud to be at the heart of this effort and confident that the Super Hercules will deliver the critical capability our nation needs.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS8yNzgyNC1vcmlvbi1zcGFjZWNyYWZ0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Orion spacecraft: NASA's next-gen capsule for astronauts,"The Orion spacecraft that will fly to the moon and back in a few month's time is ready for integration with the Space Launch System rocket.

The Orion spacecraft (more formally the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle) is NASA's vehicle of choice to take astronauts to the moon a future lunar space station and potentially on to Mars.

The spacecraft has already passed one major flight in space in 2014 and is expected to take on a second journey shortly with the Artemis 1 mission expected to launch no earlier than May 2022. An orbital mission and a landing mission are then expected later in the 2020s.

Similar in shape to the Apollo spacecraft Orion is designed to carry up to four astronauts to destinations such as the moon or Mars. Orion is a significant upgrade from Apollo — the spacecraft is newer and much larger than Apollo and sports electronics decades more advanced than what Apollo's astronauts used to fly to the moon.

Orion spacecraft development history

Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor for the spacecraft. The company began work on the spacecraft in 2004 during a competition for the contract which was valued at up to $8.15 billion when Lockheed Martin won it in August 2006.

Orion was originally built for NASA's Constellation program that was intended to bring humans to the International Space Station the moon and ultimately Mars. The program was canceled in 2010 after President Barack Obama's administration requested that NASA focus on other goals.

At that point NASA had already spent $5 billion on developing Orion and Lockheed had been working on the spacecraft for about six years. In early 2011 NASA hinted that the Orion spacecraft could be repurposed for their new directive. The agency followed up with a plan for the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle — one that was relatively close to the previous Orion spacecraft design but instead could be used for the new mandate.

""We made this choice based on the progress that's been made to date"" Doug Cooke associate administrator for NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate in Washington D.C. said to reporters on May 24 2011. ""It made the most sense to stick with [the Orion design]."" [The Orion Capsule: NASA's Next Spaceship (Photos)]

Orion persisted through its development as NASA pivoted program goals yet again when U.S. President Donald Trump tasked the agency with prioritizing moon landings over deep space excursions for a planned 2024 landing. The program eventually known as Artemis expects to put boots on the moon somewhat after that deadline which was not met due to numerous issues explained below.

The Joe Biden administration committed to continuing Artemis after coming to office in 2021. A next major stage in spacecraft development will be the Artemis 1 mission which will see how well Orion performs in a cislunar environment. That will allow engineers to ready the spacecraft for human missions later in the 2020s.

Besides the flight tests Orion has proceeded through many years of ground testing to ensure its readiness for space. Some recent milestones (after its first successful spaceflight) include completing parachute testing in 2018 acing a key propulsion test in 2019 and performing splashdown ""drop"" testing in a pool in 2021 to prepare for the first humans aboard Artemis 2.

Orion spacecraft design and interior

An overview of the Orion spacecraft's design. (Image credit: NASA)

The Orion spacecraft consists of a gumdrop-shaped capsule and service module which together are about 26 feet (8 meters) long with a diameter of 16.5 feet (5 m). The spacecraft's habitable volume is 316 cubic feet (8.95 cubic meters) which is about 1.5 times larger than the Apollo spacecraft.

Orion's crew module is just one of several components of the spacecraft. Orion also contains a launch- abort system to pull astronauts away from the spacecraft with escape rockets should something go wrong during launch.

The service module built by the European Space Agency contains solar panels for electricity oxygen for breathing and rocket engines to propel the spacecraft. Orion also includes a spacecraft adapter (which shields the service module during launch) and an instrument unit that includes the guidance and control system for the booster.

Orion's interior will include a sleek set of screens for astronauts to keep an eye on key systems and mission progress in consultation with Mission Control at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.

""Because astronauts of different sizes will be sent to the Moon in Orion the display panels and chairs need to work for 99 percent of people"" NASA wrote. ""That means making the bottom panels of the seats adjustable and arranging panels so that the smallest or largest of astronauts can reach all the controls.""

Window shades can be deployed on the windows to block out sunlight and sleeping bags will allow astronauts to comfortably strap themselves to a spot in the spacecraft for weightless sleep.

NASA is pulling from decades of research on the International Space Station the shuttle and earlier programs to keep the astronauts safe and comfortable. For example acoustics specialists were consulted to make sure equipment was humming at a comfortable level and emergency equipment is stored within easy reach in case a fire or sudden depressurization occurs.

Orion spacecraft's Exploration Flight Test-1

The first space mission of Orion was Exploration Flight Test-1 also known as EFT-1. That saw Orion undergo a space test for 4.5 hours soaring as high as 3600 miles (5800 km) for two orbits of Earth.

The spacecraft was fitted with about 1200 sensors to record essential data to inform future design such as stresses temperature pressure acceleration and vibration. It also came with ultrawide field cameras to record flight events in high definition.

Since SLS was still under construction Orion rode to space aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy booster. The rocket was still powerful enough to push Orion further into space than any humans had been since 1972 when Apollo 17 made a moon landing.

Orion also experienced the inner Van Allen Belt a zone of radiation trapped by the Earth’s magnetic field. Surviving the radiation here was key for the protection of future astronauts who will need to pass through this zone to make it to the moon.

Orion program pivot

Shortly after EFT-1 splashed down NASA said the flight had been a success. The major systems worked well; also roughly 55 percent of the capsule's technology that is deemed essential for crewed missions passed muster during the flight. The agency was hoping to fly a second test of Orion as soon as 2018 on board SLS.

But numerous challenges arose in getting ready for Artemis 1. For example NASA was tasked with changing program approaches as the Donald Trump presidency reached office. Orion was originally imagined to bring astronauts to multiple destinations in deep space but Trump directed NASA to pivot to a moon landing to as soon as 2024 necessitating that the spacecraft be repurposed for lunar work.

Additionally SLS development fell behind schedule due to multiple issues. The eruption of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 created supply chain problems and physical distancing necessities both of which slowed down manufacturing and testing.

SLS also had several technical issues in completing a ""green run"" series of testing and then had to overcome problems found with the core engines. Issues like these pushed the debut date of SLS to 2022 inducing an eight-year gap between Orion's first and second test flights.

Orion spacecraft and Artemis 1

As of this writing Artemis 1 is expected to start its mission no earlier than May 2022. It will be the first mission of NASA's SLS in partnership with the Orion spacecraft which will be on its second program mission.

Orion will take a much further journey this time around however going on a a 236000-mile-long (380000-kilometre-long) journey to the moon. According to NASA ""Orion will stay in space longer than any ship for astronauts has done without docking to a space station and return home faster and hotter than ever before.""

One of the mission's first jobs upon leaving Earth orbit will be to eject several tiny satellite hitchhikers. An example is BioSentinel which carry yeast samples into deep space to study how radiation affects living organisms. The applications will be carried forward to Artemis 2 and other missions with humans.

As Orion swoops around the moon it will be accompanied by several mannequin-type devices to give even more information on how the lunar environment affects humans.

""Commander Moonikin Campos"" named after Apollo 13 engineer Arturo Campos in a NASA contest will fly in the commander's seat wearing the same Orion Crew Survival System spacesuit that astronauts will don later in the program. Also on Campos will be radiation sensors and instrumentation for vibration and acceleration data.

Two simulated female astronauts will fly on other Orion seats from the German space agency (DLR). One of them Zohar is wearing a a radiation-shielding vest called StemRad while the other Helga will serve as a control with no such protection.

The mission will include several Lego astronauts and even Snoopy the famous ""Peanuts"" dog who also served as a moniker for Apollo 10 lunar spacecraft that approached the surface of the moon. This time around he will be a ""zero-gravity indicator"" and will wear the Orion spacesuit in miniature.

Orion will remain in a retrograde orbit for between six and 19 days before getting a gravity assist from a return towards the moon. The assist will help Orion fly back to Earth on a journey that should take another nine to 19 days.

Finally Orion will make a high-speed re-entry similar to what was tested during Orion's first test flight in 2014 when the spacecraft got as high as 3600 miles (5800 kilometers) above Earth. It will descend for an ocean splashdown under parachutes and the data will later be analyzed to get ready for human missions.

Assuming that Artemis 1 is completed with no major issues Artemis 2 will be the next major moon mission. Artemis 2 is expected to launch around May 2024 (compared with a previous goal of September 2023 induced by delays to Artemis 1.)

The mission will see a group of astronauts ride around the moon in the Orion spacecraft. NASA administrator Bill Nelson told reporters in 2021 that Artemis 2 will travel ""further than humans have ever been probably 40000 miles [about 64000 kilometers] beyond the moon"" before returning to Earth.

The crew for Artemis 2 has not yet been named. NASA has a set of astronauts prequalified for Artemis missions known as the ""Artemis team."" The group includes women and several non-white astronauts which will distinguish the Artemis program from its predecessor Apollo that saw 12 white men land on the moon.

Also on the team will be a so-far unnamed Canadian Space Agency astronaut as a thank-you for the country's contribution of Canadarm3. This robotic arm will continue a series of Canadarms that were active during the space shuttle and now the International Space Station era. Canadarm3 will have artificial intelligence embedded in its software to do repairs and maintenance.

The arm will fly aboard a planned space station NASA plans to put near the moon called Gateway. It will host crews for between one and three months to do science to assist with landing missions and to test out technology such as telerobotics.

Gateway's orbit will be a ""near rectilinear halo orbit"" (NRHO). It will range between 1860 miles and 43500 miles (3000 and 70000 kilometers) from the surface of the moon according to the European Space Agency This will allow Gateway to experience a minimum of eclipses for consistent solar power.

Orion and Artemis 3

Artemis 3 will see a crew of astronauts including the first woman and potentially the first person of color alight on the moon's surface. The crew is expected to touch down somewhere in the south pole which is a region unexplored by people or missions to date. But it is a potentially valuable zone full of volatiles such as water that could be harvested for mining or astronaut needs.

NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program which seeks to send a set of private landers and experiments to the moon plans to explore the region in more detail in the coming years. For example NASA's Polar Resources Ice-Mining Experiment-1 (PRIME-1) is expected to land at Shackleton Crater aboard an Intuitive Machines Nova-C lander.

NASA will use what it learned from PRIME-1 to prepare for a more ambitious lunar rover mission the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER). This mission targeted for a 2023 landing is expected to touch down just west of Nobile a crater near the moon's south pole.

The moon landing for Artemis 3 is expected no earlier than 2025 although NASA's Office of the Inspector General has repeatedly expressed pessimism about that deadline and now says it will be at least 2026. For one thing technology and logistics problems have already pushed back Artemis 1. Other things are making the timeline for Artemis 3 fuzzy too.

The agency's development of next-generation spacesuits called the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) is facing delays. Budgetary concerns and a 20-month delay in designing verifying and testing the suits are among the problems cited. NASA also decided to pivot much of the work to a contractor to save costs but which is expected to add time to the process.

Another worry is the Human Landing System (HLS) that is supposed to be readied by SpaceX. The program was delayed seven months in 2021 due to protests and a lawsuit by Blue Origin last year (all resolved by November) concerning NASA's sole-source award.

The Artemis program's ballooning cost is also at issue. The first four Artemis missions are expected to cost $4.1 billion each according to a November 2021 OIG audit.

Like other Western countries the United States has turned to its own stocks to furnish Ukraine with shoulder-fired Stinger and Javelin missiles for instance. These weapons from Lockheed-Martin and Raytheon Technologies were paid for some time ago.

So these companies' first quarter results due to be released in coming weeks should not be especially fatter because of the rush to arm Ukraine as it fights off the Russian invasion.

But those US military weapons stockpiles being tapped for Kyiv will need to be replenished.

The Pentagon plans to use $3.5 billion earmarked for this purpose in a spending bill approved in mid-March a Defense Department spokesman told AFP.

The Javelin anti-tank missile is made by a joint venture between Lockheed and Raytheon. The latter's Stinger anti-aircraft missile had ceased to be produced until the Pentagon ordered $340 million of them last summer.

""We are exploring options to more quickly replenish US inventories and backfill depleted stocks of allies and partners"" the spokesman said.

""It will take time to revive the industrial base -- at the prime and at sub-tier suppliers -- to enable production to resume"" he added.

The profits that the companies make from these missiles known for being simple to use will not exactly be staggering defense industry experts told AFP.

""If 1000 Stingers and 1000 Javelins get shipped to Eastern Europe each month for the next year which is not unlikely given the current pace in our view we think it would equate to $1 billion to $2 billion in revenue for both program manufacturers which is material"" said Colin Scarola of CFRA an investment research firm.

Raytheon's and Lockheed's revenue figures last year dwarf that amount however: $64 billion and $67 billion respectively.

""Raytheon probably made more money off selling a Patriot missile system to Saudi Arabia than they will from making Stinger missiles"" said Jordan Cohen an arms sales specialist at the Cato Institute.

""They're only going to put so much effort into producing those weapons that are not that valuable"" Cohen told AFP.

Lockheed Raytheon and another arms manufacturer Northrop Grumman did not respond to AFP requests for comment.

General Dynamics said it has not raised its financial outlook since January while Boeing just said it is up to governments to decide how to spend money earmarked for defense.

- Competition among major powers -

Some weapons manufacturing executives hinted when they last released quarterly results in late January that the situation around the world would benefit them.

Greg Hayes Raytheon's CEO said that rising tensions in Asia the Middle East and Eastern Europe would lead to higher international sales -- not right away but later in 2022 and beyond.

His counterpart at Lockheed-Martin James Taiclet said he observed ""renewed great power competition"" that could trigger higher US military spending.

""The war in Ukraine reshuffles the geopolitical order in a way that hasn't really been seen in the past 30 years"" said Burkett Huey of Morningstar a financial services company.

""People are starting to realize that the world is a lot less safe and there's probably going to need to be increased investment in defense products which would benefit the contractors"" Huey said.

Eric Heginbotham a researcher at the MIT Center for International Studies said that for Western governments -- as has been the case for years in Asia -- ""there will be much less appetite for decreases"" in military spending.

In the United States President Joe Biden has proposed a four percent increase in the Pentagon budget. Inflation in America is running much higher but Biden at least did not propose spending cuts.

Germany long wary of high military budgets announced a major policy shift in late February after the Russian invasion of Ukraine saying it would immediately free up 100 billion euros to modernize its armed forces.

""Countries are going to be looking to increase interoperability with the United States which is really sort of the central pillar in NATO"" said Heginbotham.

In mid-March Germany said it would acquire F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed. It will take several years for them to be delivered and it is then when manufacturers get paid for the most part.

This ""sort of F-35-ification of European armies"" is good business for US military contractors and the US military also likes it because it means common operating platforms said Eric Gomez a defense policy expert at the Cato Institute.

""But on the other side it makes it harder for the United States to kind of ever consider stepping back from Europe as the Biden administration keeps saying that China is the big game in town"" said Gomez.

(Published 2022),"In the latest season of “The Bachelor” Clayton Echard the show’s 26th lead said after a late-night rendezvous with a hopeful suitress “If I ever need validation to know that this process works I’m seeing it unfold before me.”

But according to the numbers perhaps unsurprisingly that “process” — a weeks-long mass courtship in front of cameras that is meant to end with a proposal and presumably a marriage — is not very effective at yielding long-term relationships.

Since “The Bachelor” debuted on ABC in March 2002 and “The Bachelorette” the following year only six couples who met on those shows are currently married. A seventh is expected to wed in May. In this time there have been 34 televised proposals in 44 seasons combined. Taking into account those who met on other spinoffs the number of currently married couples jumps from six to 10. (Representatives from Warner Bros and ABC declined to comment for this article.)

First he’s setting his sights on a three-peat in the AL East. And if they check that box Lowe understands the Rays will need more from him in October than he's provided in the past. He initially brushed aside his struggles in the 2020 playoffs when he hit .118 with 28 strikeouts in 82 plate appearances as the product of a strange season or even just a small-sample-size slump.



Then in the Rays’ four-game loss to the Red Sox in last year’s AL Division Series Lowe went 0-for-18 with nine strikeouts. He had some hard-hit balls especially in Game 1 but had nothing to show for any of his work. He went home to Nashville Tenn. where he worked out all offseason with a sour taste in his mouth.



But first right after the Rays’ season ended Lowe pulled aside coordinator of Major League operations Bobby Kinne and asked him to do a deep dive on his postseason performance then report back with as much unforgiving information as possible.



“Last year after the postseason ended I personally went in and was like 'Give me every single type of number that you can give me. Why am I not Brandon Lowe in the postseason?'” he said. “So I went back and sat down with Bobby and sat down with some of our analytic guys like 'Let's figure this out. What's going differently?'



“We think we figured some stuff out so hopefully we get to the postseason again this year with an AL East title under our belt and we have a little bit more fun in the postseason.”

LULU,Lululemon Athletica,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzAzLzMtcmVhc29ucy1pbnZlc3RvcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJ1eS1hbmQtaG9sZC1sdWx1bGVtb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Reasons Investors Should Buy and Hold Lululemon Stock,"This rising star in sports wear continues to find ways to grow.

Shares of Lululemon Athletica (LULU -1.38%) are underwater for the year but a better-than-expected earnings report sent the stock surging. The stock is currently down 4.8% year to date outperforming the Nasdaq Composite that is down 8.2%.

Despite near-term economic uncertainty Lululemon remains on offense. Here are three highlights from the quarter that should encourage investors to buy and hold this top retail stock.

Peter Lynch would love Lululemon

On a two-year compounded basis Lululemon's fiscal fourth-quarter revenue increased 23%. Total revenue for the full year crossed $6 billion for the first time. But note that Q4's rate of growth is higher than Lululemon's performance in fiscal 2015 when revenue grew 15% to reach $2.1 billion for the year.

The consistency of Lululemon's growth would have appealed to famed investor Peter Lynch who looked for promising growth stories in retail that continued to get better as a company executed its growth strategy. Lululemon's story is certainly getting more interesting after launching its new footwear line recently.

Untapped growth opportunities

Lululemon introduced its new women's footwear line called Blissfeel in early March. While it's still early management reported that the guest response has exceeded their expectations.

By going after the women's market first with a men's shoe scheduled to launch in 2023 Lululemon believes it has an opportunity to make a big splash in this competitive market.

""We intentionally started with women first because we saw an opportunity to solve for the fact that more often than not performance shoes are designed for men and then adapted for women"" Chief Product Officer Sun Choe explained in a press release announcing the new shoe line.

Lululemon plans to launch additional women's styles this year and use the same approach with men next year.

Small brand in a large and growing industry

Lululemon has been a tremendous success story since its founding with a single selling space in a yoga studio in Vancouver more than 20 years ago. It continues to gradually expand its store footprint opening 22 new stores last quarter across Asia Pacific North America and Europe bringing the total to 574 worldwide. It also has a strong online presence that generated 49% of total revenue last quarter.

Overall Lululemon is a tiny $6 billion brand operating in an athletic wear industry that generates nearly $200 billion in annual revenue. As CEO Calvin McDonald explained on the earnings call Lululemon is benefiting from ""category strength as athletic apparel continues to outpace growth in overall apparel.""

Lululemon is a relatively low-risk investment with big return potential. It has proven itself for 20 years with steady growth and most importantly the brand is showing universal appeal as it expands everywhere from China to Europe. Investors who buy and hold this retail stock should beat the market's average return soundly over the next 20 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzAyL2N1c3RvbWVycy1sb3ZlLXRoZXNlLTMtaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1jb21wYW5pZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Customers Love These 3 Healthcare Companies,"Net Promoter Scores can provide insights into customer satisfaction and possibly lead to market-beating returns.

Trying to predict where the market will go over the short term is next to impossible. But when you're searching for potentially profitable places to park your hard-earned cash you might want to start by considering companies with particularly happy customers. With this in mind let's look at three companies that clearly do please their customers based on a metric called the Net Promoter Score (NPS).

NPS is a metric that's based on people's responses to a single survey question along these lines: ""On a scale of 0 to 10 how likely would you be to recommend this company product or service to a friend or colleague?"" That key question is usually followed up with a question or three attempting to gauge why each respondent gave the answer that they did.

But it's that first question that counts. Those who respond with a 9 or 10 are classified as ""promoters"" -- customers who will keep coming back and more importantly who will enthusiastically recommend the business to others. Those whose answers are 6 or lower are the ""detractors"" -- folks who will disparage the company or its products. Subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters and you get the Net Promoter Score.

Obviously higher scores are better. They range from -100 to +100 and if a business's NPS is a negative number that's a problem. Any positive number though is at least good. According to the management consultants at Bain & Co. which invented the NPS a score above 20 is favorable above 50 is great and an 80 or above is world class.

And this gauge of customer loyalty also tends to forecast business growth -- which brings us to three healthcare companies that are overwhelmingly pleasing their customers based on this metric: 1Life Healthcare (ONEM) with an NPS of 90; Dexcom's (DXCM 1.00%) which scored an 83; and FIGS (FIGS -3.77%) which scored an 81.

1Life Healthcare

1Life Healthcare which does business under the name One Medical is keeping patients thrilled with its primary-care medical practices as evidenced by its eye-popping NPS of 90. The membership-based primary care platform grew its total member count by 34% in 2021 to 736000. In the process it grew its full-year revenue by 64%. And with such a high NPS it's no wonder One Medical's membership plans have a better than 90% retention rate.

The company helps keep its patients in above-average health too. Its offices were ranked first by the New York City Health Department for viral load suppression among HIV patients (a measure of controlled disease). One Medical's mental health services have been shown to drive a 50% reduction in severe anxiety. In diabetic patients One Medical's patients have reductions in average blood glucose levels that are twice what others have shown in publications. Clearly its model seems to be working well for patients.

The combination of quality healthcare and satisfied customers has driven growth and that's expected to continue. The company expects to end 2022 with 14% more members than at the beginning of the year and sees full-year net revenue landing in the $1.045 billion to $1.085 billion range -- roughly 70% higher than in 2021.

Despite all that growth Wall Street doesn't seem to appreciate the model. One Medical's shares are down almost 40% year to date -- and by almost 80% from their February 2021 peak -- making this stock an interesting watch list candidate.

Dexcom

Medical device company Dexcom also has a strong fanbase. Its popular G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system recently earned an NPS of 83 among the diabetic patients who use it. Those happy patients have led to ecstatic investors. Dexcom's shares are up by more than 500% in the last five years -- and by more than 4900% in the last 10 years.

Despite its size -- its market cap is in the neighborhood of $51 billion -- Dexcom continues to expand. Total revenue grew 23% in 2021 and in foreign markets sales grew by 54%. With the omicron COVID-19 surge largely in the rear-view mirror its sales force is starting to make it back into medical offices further driving device uptake. In addition the competition seems to be stumbling. In December rival Medtronic received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration regarding faults with its insulin pumps.

Adding to DexCom's tailwinds the American Diabetes Association recently stated that CGM can be useful for people with diabetes who require multiple daily injections of insulin. This almost doubles Dexcom's addressable market in the U.S. from 4 million to about 7 million. And the company believes new geographies will more than triple its total addressable market by the second half of 2023. In addition the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now estimates that 38% of adults in America -- 96 million people -- have pre-diabetes. Between that and over 40% of U.S. adults reporting undesired weight gain since the start of the pandemic the potential market for Dexcom is significant.

FIGS

Healthcare outfitter FIGS frequently draws comparisons to athleisure apparel maker Lululemon Athletica (LULU -1.38%) thanks to its stylish scrubs. And based on FIGS' NPS of 81 and Lululemon's score of 83 both companies are doing an excellent job of pleasing their customers. And scrubs maker FIGS has the growth to prove it.

With net revenue up 62% to $420 million in 2021 FIGS is firing on all cylinders. Its active customer base grew 46% to 1.9 million last year and net revenue per active customer rose by $22 year-over-year and by $39 over the last two years. It also increased its repeat customer revenues to 68% up from 62% in 2020. Plus its fledgling international business -- currently its only foreign markets are the U.K. Canada and Australia -- tripled in 2021 providing 7% of revenue. Management plans to enter new markets in 2022.

FIGS knows its customers well. It actually tailors its site to offer more personalized content to its consumers resulting in a higher conversion rate. In the fourth quarter these personalized experiences resulted in a conversion rate that was almost twice what it had been before it began using tailored content. Half of its new customers come back and buy again within a year. And if buyers purchase from FIGS in two consecutive years they are likely to stay loyal -- over 95% of those customers purchase from it again in year three.

Companies with high Net Promoter Scores are worth a second look

While a Net Promoter Score certainly isn't the only way to measure the outlook for a stock a strong number should certainly get investors' attention.

Companies whose scores are far higher than those of their peers have tended to well reward their shareholders over the years. While the market and individual share prices will always fluctuate a high NPS indicates the type of brand loyalty that can outlive short-term volatility.

Given how well they are satisfying their customers FIGS Dexcom and One Medical deserve consideration for investors' watch lists.",,,,,,,,,

After missing the past two-plus seasons with a knee injury Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball has exercised the $21.4 million option on his contract for the 2024-25 season sources told ESPN on Saturday.

Ball has undergone three surgeries on his left knee the most recent a cartilage transplant in 2023. There remains some guarded hope that he could return next season but there are no assurances that the damaged knee will allow for him to play again.

Ball 26 signed an original four-year $80 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade with New Orleans in the summer of 2021. After a fantastic start that had the Bulls leading the Eastern Conference in 2021-22 Ball averaged 13.0 points 5.4 rebounds 5.1 assists and 1.8 steals before a knee injury 35 games into the season.

His inactivity has caused his contract to become a blight on the Bulls' salary cap.

Ball was the No. 2 overall pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2017 NBA draft and eventually was traded to the Pelicans as part of the Anthony Davis blockbuster deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWZhbGwtZ3V5LXBoYW50b20tbWVuYWNlLTEyMzU4OTA0NzAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Box Office: 'The Fall Guy' Lands with $28.5M 'Phantom Menace' Tops 'Challengers' for No. 2,"It was the ‘80s and ‘90s all over again at the weekend box office. Universal’s The Fall Guy the Ryan Gosling starrer inspired by the 1980s TV show kicked off the summer movie season at No. 1 with $28.5 million while Disney’s rerelease of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace surprised by coming in at No. 2 with $8.1 million.

Despite The Fall Guy’s No. 1 finish its haul came in behind initial expectations of $30 million to $35 million and overall the box office is down dramatically from the same frame a year ago when Marvel Studios’ Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 bowed to $118.4 million domestically. The weekend is down 53 percent from last year and off more than 66 percent from 2022 when Marvel’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness opened to $187.4 million domestically.

The Fall Guy is said to have a net budget of $130 million after tax incentives for shooting in Australia. Universal will now hope that Fall Guy’s A- CinemaScore from audiences will help it make up ground in the coming weeks with word of mouth. It also boasts strong reviews out of South by Southwest.

The feature hails from stuntman-turned-director David Leitch and has been marketed as a love letter to the stunt community. Gosling at the height of his star power thanks to his Oscar-nominated turn as Ken in Barbie fronts the picture as a beaten down stuntman who comes out of retirement to try to find a missing A-list star and save a film (which happens to be directed by his ex played by Emily Blunt). The feature has a global cume of $65.4 globally.

Phantom Menace‘s weekend is a nice turn of events for the film. It kicked off George Lucas’ Star Wars prequel trilogy in 1999 and for years after was a punchline for audiences and Star Wars fans but has grown in appreciation in the decades since with younger fans who grew up on the film coming into adulthood and star Ewan McGregor reprising his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi for his own Disney+ series in 2022 helping further build nostalgia for the film. It returned to theaters as part of the film’s 25th anniversary as well as for May the 4th the unofficial Star Wars holiday.

The Phantom Menace edged out Amazon MGM Studios’ sexy tennis drama Challengers for No. 2. The Luca Guadagnino feature had a solid hold in weekend two dropping just 49 percent for a weekend gross of $7.6 million and a cume of $29.4 million. Zendaya Josh O’Connor and Mike Faist star.

Sony and Screen Gem’s Tarot bowed in its first weekend to $6.5 million a solid start considering the feature cost $8 million and did not have a traditional marketing campaign. Sony embarked on its first digital-only campaign for Tarot meaning no TV spots or billboards for the feature in which seven friends accidentally unleash an evil entity trapped in a deck of cursed Tarot cards. Neither critics nor audiences embraced this one. It has an 8 percent on Rotten Tomatoes while audiences gave it a low C- CinemaScore. It ends the weekend with a global haul of $10.2 million to date.

For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

Interim President Jeff Ettinger’s budget for the next fiscal year proposes to slap a 4.5 percent tuition hike on in-state undergraduate students studying at the Twin Cities campus. If approved by the Board of Regents that would be the highest annual tuition increase for Minnesota residents since 2010.

Students at other campuses would also pay more money.

“Tuition increases always suck” said Blake Barrington a freshman. “I think sometimes the fault is on the university for spending it needlessly. There’s a lot of clubs and activities that the university funds that I don’t think are necessarily needed.""

Create a More Connected Minnesota MPR News is your trusted resource for the news you need. With your support MPR News brings accessible courageous journalism and authentic conversation to everyone - free of paywalls and barriers. Your gift makes a difference.

At least two members of the Board of Regents seem reluctant to embrace the proposed increase.

“I only learned that we were considering a tuition increase this weekend” wrote Robyn Gulley who represents the Second Congressional District in an email to MPR News. “I have not been convinced that increasing tuition for our students — compelling many to take additional loans or work longer hours to make tuition payments — will benefit our whole university more than it will harm our students. I expect to vote no on this proposed tuition increase.”

James Farnsworth a regent representing St. Paul hadn’t heard about the proposed tuition hikes until he read about in the newspaper on Friday.

“In general I’m not supportive of putting our budgetary pressures on the backs of our students right now” he wrote in an email. “But [I] haven’t digested the proposal enough to be knowledgeable comment on it.”

In real terms the total increase in tuition room and board and fees for Minnesota residents would raise costs by an additional $453 to $1552 per year depending on the campus. For Twin Cities undergrads who reside in-state tuition could increase by 4.5 percent to $15148.

The U has consistently raised tuition across campuses but in recent years has not exceeded annual hikes of 2-3 percent for locals. Proposed residential raises at other U campuses range from 1.5 to 4.5 percent and are anticipated to bring in $42.2 million in revenue.

“A large part of coming from in-state and going to the U is the fact that the tuition is a lot more affordable” said freshman Adella Mulawarman. “I’m curious to see if they go ahead and increase it if there will be a difference in how many in-state students decide to attend here.”

Thanks to scholarships Mulawarman got a break on tuition this year. But those scholarships are drying up and next year she’s worried about having to take out loans.

Tuition hikes could be incoming for out-of-state students too where the track record for an increasing price tag has been steeper. At the Twin Cities campus non-resident undergraduates could face a 5.5 percent tuition increase bringing tuition to $36296. A decade ago tuition was just over $19000 for non-residents.

In a Star Tribune Op-Ed last month regents Janie S. Mayeron Douglas A. Huebsch and Kenyanya urged state legislators to approve the U’s funding request to help cover the cost for students and employee pay.

“As a nonprofit public university our recurring operating fund request will minimize tuition increases for students and families who should not shoulder the burden of the state’s diminishing support” they wrote. “It will also help provide our 27000 faculty and staff members systemwide with fair compensation and the facilities they need to remain competitive in the workforce. They all deserve support by state leaders.”

Students who choose U housing may also have to anticipate higher room and board costs at all campuses. That change is “primarily driven by inflationary cost pressures” according to the proposal.

At the Duluth campus standard room and board costs could go up by 8.9 percent bringing the typical total to $10456 per year. In the Twin Cities that’s a 6.5 percent increase bringing room and board totals up to $13606.

A 6 percent increase is proposed at Morris 5.2 percent at Rochester and 2.8 percent at Crookston.

The attendance cost hikes are paired with proposed expense reductions of $13.7 million. The bulk of that reduction is planned through eliminating positions after employees leave and hiring replacement employees at lower salaries.

Additional expense reductions are proposed through scaling back in-person events and conferences reducing certain research and educational programs and shrinking food and supply budgets in some departments.

The public is welcome to comment on the proposal at the U Regents meeting Friday or online through the morning of June 7. The 12-member Board of Regents are expected to vote on the final budget in June.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDI0L2RvY3VzaWduLXRvLWFjcXVpcmUtbGV4aW9uLWZvci0xNjVtLWluLWV4aXQtZm9yLXNlYXR0bGUtYmFzZWQtYWktY29udHJhY3QtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1jb21wYW55L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Docusign to acquire Lexion for $165M in exit for Seattle-based AI contract management company,"Gaurav Oberoi Lexion CEO speaks during the 2023 GeekWire Summit in Seattle. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota)

Docusign announced an agreement to acquire Lexion for $165 million signaling plans to integrate the Seattle-based company’s AI-powered contract management technology into its Intelligent Agreement Management Platform.

The deal looks to be a successful exit for Lexion which got its start in 2018 after co-founders Gaurav Oberoi (CEO) Emad Elwany (CTO) and James Baird (principal architect) met at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle.

Lexion raised about $36 million since its founding including a $20 million round in April 2022 after tripling its revenue in 2022. After focusing initially on helping legal departments manage contracts the company expanded to help people in sales IT finance and HR manage contracts and other documents such as RFPs and questionnaires.

Investors included Madrona Point72 Private Investments Khosla Ventures Citi Ventures and Wilson Sonsini.

Oberoi Baird and Elwany are slated to join Docusign in senior product and engineering roles.

“We will drive innovation deliver greater value to both Docusign and Lexion customers along with a broader organization that has a deep understanding of the agreement management space” Oberoi said in a news release.

In a post on LinkedIn Oberoi said the acquisition represents a “huge opportunity” to combine Lexion’s products with DocuSign’s reach and resources.

“I am humbled and thrilled to join Docusign and to create magic with our people products and customers” Oberoi wrote.

Lexion has more than 100 employees according to LinkedIn. Docusign said in its news release that Lexion “brings to Docusign a team of world-class AI engineers with backgrounds at Amazon Google Meta and Microsoft along with a broader organization that has a deep understanding of the agreement management space.”

It would be the fourth acquisition to emerge from the Allen Institute for AI and the AI2 Incubator which is separately owned and operated after spinning out in 2022. Earlier deals were Baidu’s 2017 acquisition of Kitt.ai; Apple’s 2000 acquisition of Xnor.ai; and the acquisition of BirchAI by Sagility in March of this year.

San Francisco-based Docusign has roots in Seattle and an ongoing engineering presence in the region. The company said the pending acquisition of Lexion is “subject to customary adjustments.” A spokesperson said the deal is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.

Lexion — officially known as DocuSmart Inc. — is a finalist for Workplace of the Year at Thursday’s 2024 GeekWire Awards and Oberoi is also a finalist for CEO of the Year at the event this week in Seattle.

In the first quarter of this year there were 55 AI-related VC-backed startups acquired up from 38 in the fourth quarter of 2023 according to Crunchbase."

The BLU-Tique at Main and Market streets is now part of Marriott International's Tribute Portfolio a collection of more than 55 independently owned upscale boutique hotels around the world. Marriott with some 30 brands is the world's largest hotel operator based on number of rooms.

The ownership group of the 71-room BLU-Tique which has been closed since mid-March 2020 plan to reopen the hotel later this year. (Owners currently are reluctant to say when they think that will happen.) When it does reopen the hotel restaurant will have a revamped fresh farm-to-table Mediterranean-themed menu. The hotel's original management team Medina-based Riley Hotel Group remains in place.

The new affiliation with Marriott will expand the BLU-Tique's reach and generate better awareness for the property owner and developer Tony Troppe said last week. The hotel will not be rebranded as a Marriott Hotel or have to change or add exterior signage he said.

BLU-Zone reflects city history culture

""It's a great relationship. It's been founded upon the recognition of a unique character for place"" Troppe said. ""The Tribute Portfolio is looking for exciting Akron-centric in this particular case places that reflect the character of their community. ... So they quickly understood what we were attempting to do in the BLU-Zone in the epicenter of what is really the historic arts district.""

The BLU-Zone is Troppe's vision for this particular part of Akron's downtown which includes the BLU-Tique Hotel the BLU Jazz+ club and other properties including restaurants to connect to the city's arts and culture history there.

""We were reflecting the past and building for the future"" Troppe said. He likes to call the area ""the crossroads of commerce and culture.""

Riley Hotel Group operates other hotels many of them boutique and that appealed to Marriott he said. Marriott is looking at the uniqueness and character of each hotel property and what it can bring to those sites he said.

The partnership is coming at a necessary time for the BLU-Tique.

The pandemic has been devastating to the hospitality industry that includes hotels restaurants and others said Joe Moffa president of Riley Hotel Group.

""The last two years have been difficult"" he said.

Moffa said he Troppe and others in the ownership group are working diligently to reopen the BLU-tique.

""We were open 61 days"" and then had to close Moffa said. During the closure the BLU-Tique has had monthly ""carry"" costs of $50000 to $75000 he said.

""We have a $13 million investment there"" Moffa said. The ownership group's bank has worked with them on the finances including getting deferrals during the pandemic he said. The city of Akron and Mayor Dan Horrigan have been great to work with over the last two years he said.

Still he said ""At the end of the day it's 25 months since we've been open.""

While developers in other cities likely would have walked away and left the property vacant Moffa and Troppe said that will not happen with the BLU-Tique.

""We're not going to do that"" Moffa said. ""We want to be in downtown Akron.""

Having Marriott as a partner will help the BLU-Tique recover and grow Moffa said.

""BLU-Tique was a 'brand internacional' in my mind. And now it's official as we join the Marriott family of great international properties"" Troppe said. ""We were able to tap into their global marketing system.""

New technology upgrades introduced

The BLU-tique as a result of being affiliated with the Tribute Portfolio can take part in the global Marriott loyalty/rewards and points benefit program Bonvoy Tropp said.

To become part of Tribune Portfolio the BLU-Tique owners have had to reinvest in the building and make changes that included upgrading technology that for instance will allow guests to check in using their smartphones.

Talks with Marriott started shortly after the BLU-Tique closed on March 15 2020 Troppe said.

""We had just opened for a bright new year of 2020 aspirations"" Troppe said. Then state pandemic requirements forced the closure he said.

Troppe and Riley Hotel Group began discussing how to reopen and reposition the BLU-Tique ""to take advantage of a very different market"" with expected changes in business and leisure travel he said.

""It made sense for us to team up with the world's best"" Troppe said.

Hotel expansion possible

What also will help the BLU-Tique and other local hospitality businesses will be the return of employees to downtown Akron offices and increased foot traffic Moffa said.

""We need businesses to get back to normal"" he said. The industry needs more business travel business meetings and meals he said.

""We need people walking around downtown Akron"" he said.

The reopening of the BLU-Tique at some point this year will be exciting Moffa said.

""I can't think of a more highly anticipated opening in downtown"" he said.

The BLU-Tique the former United Building officially opened with a New Year's Eve celebration in 2019.

The $10 million boutique hotel was redeveloped with the support of historic tax credits and other financing. The 58000-square-foot eight-story property at 1 S. Main St. that originally opened in 1924 at one time was the headquarters of the United Cigar Co.

Troppe said his vision includes expanding the BLU-Tique name and hotel concept elsewhere in the United States. He also said there is room at the Akron site to build an 85-room addition that would being the total number of rooms to 156. That expansion is probably three to five years away he estimated.

Why Join Marriott Bonvoy?

If you are a new member you would like to know why is Marriott Bonvoy an essential part of your toolkit for travel in the future. There are many reasons but two key reasons are primary: Reach & Rewards.

Reach is easy to explain. Marriott Bonvoy is the loyalty and rewards programme for over 7900 properties around the world which operate under 30 brands in 135 countries. These hotels span the whole gamut of hospitality operations from long-stay hotels such as Marriott Executive Apartments to luxury brands such as St. Regis and select-service brands such as Four Points and homestays as well. This means that whether it is your honeymoon at a top-of-the-line beach resort or a one-night stay near the airport before your flight the next morning the same loyalty programme fits both your requirements and helps you earn rewards.

Rewards can be earned by booking directly with Marriott hotels or via Marriott.com/group websites and the Contact Centres globally. Booking via an Online Travel Agent such as MakeMyTrip or tour operators won’t qualify for rewards under the programme.

Marriott Bonvoy points are the rewards that you earn on every stay booked via these channels. Marriott Bonvoy members earn a base reward of 10 points per US Dollar spent on qualifying charges for stays at most Marriott hotel brands. On top of this members with elite status at Marriott also earn elite bonuses. Another opportunity is to participate in ongoing promotions and earn more Marriott Bonvoy points.

Marriott Bonvoy points can then be redeemed at participating hotels across the globe for a genuinely free stay starting from 5000 Marriott Bonvoy Points. In India alone there are 129 properties to choose from at the time of writing this post. You can also redeem your points for Marriott Moments which are a great way to get money can’t buy experiences by using your Marriott Bonvoy points.

Adding an authorized user to your credit card account can be a great way to meet spending requirements accrue more points and even help a novice build their credit history. While it can be highly beneficial there are also risks associated with adding an authorized user — or even being one yourself.

It's important to choose someone who is responsible and able to repay their debts even if they're not legally obligated to do so. That's just the tip of the iceberg so here is everything you need to know about authorized users.

What is an authorized user?

An authorized user is a person who has been added to a primary credit cardholder's account. Authorized users receive cards with their names on them linked to the primary cardholder's account. They're able to use those cards to make purchases just like they would with their own cards.

Benefits of adding authorized users

Adding authorized users can be beneficial to both the primary cardholder and the authorized user for a few reasons:

The authorized user can help meet spending requirements on the primary cardholder's account.

The authorized user can establish a credit history early on.

But perhaps the best reason to add authorized users is the ability to take advantage of various card benefits for authorized users.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

For example you can add up to 10 authorized users for free on the Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard® granting each of them (plus two guests or immediate family members) access to Admirals Club lounges when flying American or its partners.

Meanwhile you can add up to four authorized users for free on the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card extending access to Capital One and Priority Pass lounges for your authorized user and up to two guests.

Additionally having authorized users on your Ultimate Rewards credit card allows you to transfer rewards directly to their loyalty program accounts. This is really great if you have a stash of Ultimate Rewards points you want to transfer to a family member's MileagePlus account. Sharing United miles carries a fee of $7.50 per 500 miles plus a $30 processing fee. But you can transfer Ultimate Rewards points directly into the United MileagePlus account of an authorized user without violating any rules or incurring hefty fees.

While Chase allows household members to transfer Ultimate Rewards points to each other in order to transfer Ultimate Rewards directly into another loyalty account (e.g. United Southwest Hyatt) the other account must be held by an authorized user on your Chase credit card.

The downside of adding authorized users

The downside of adding authorized users is that it may become more difficult to track spending when two people are using the same card. Also the primary cardholder is responsible for all charges to the account. So if your authorized user goes on a spending spree and refuses to cover the charges you'll be on the hook for their purchases.

Making someone an authorized user carries risk. Only add an authorized user you completely trust and be sure to communicate ahead of time about your expectations for repayment.

Who can be an authorized user?

Barring issuer-specific age restrictions anyone can be an authorized user. American Express requires authorized users to be at least 13 years old and have no defaulted accounts with the bank. Discover imposes a minimum age of 15 and U.S. Bank requires authorized users to be at least 16 years old.

Bank of America Capital One Chase Citi and Wells Fargo do not impose age restrictions.

Can I remove an authorized user?

Removing an authorized user is as simple as calling your credit card issuer. Some banks including Citi even let you do it online. Once the user has been removed from the account which is typically done in a matter of minutes the credit card becomes inactive.

However it may take several weeks for the card to no longer be listed as an active account on your authorized user's credit report.

Get the most benefit for adding an authorized user

Some credit cards will provide incentives for adding authorized users to your account. For example the Virgin Atlantic World Elite Mastercard® currently offers 30000 Flying Club bonus miles after spending $1000 or more in purchases within the first 90 days of account opening.

Additionally you can earn up to 15000 Flying Club bonus miles every anniversary after qualifying purchases and up to 5000 Flying Club bonus miles when you add additional cardholders to your account.

The information for the Virgin Atlantic card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Furthermore if you have a credit card that offers a big spending incentive adding an authorized user is a great way to help you meet that requirement. For example spending on your Southwest credit cards counts toward the coveted Companion Pass. Earning 125000 points per year is a little easier when you have a big-spending (and responsible) authorized user to help you get there.

Another way to benefit from having an authorized user on your card is with the The Platinum Card® from American Express. The card carries a flat $195 fee to add each authorized user (see rates and fees). However this includes key benefits like lounge access complimentary Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors Gold elite status and more.

Note that you can add up to five authorized users to the American Express® Gold Card for free (see rates and fees). These authorized users can then earn Membership Rewards points at the same rate as the primary cardholder: 4 points per dollar at restaurants and 4 points per dollar at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25000 in purchases per calendar year then 1 point per dollar).

This is a great way for household members to get many of the best benefits of two rewarding cards.

How do authorized users affect my credit — and their own?

Adding an authorized user will not impact your credit unless the additional card racks up a large amount of spending and increases your credit utilization ratio. This can be avoided by paying off large balances before the statement closing date.

Meanwhile authorized users can see a positive credit impact by having access to an additional credit line and lowering their own credit utilization ratios. For those building a credit history being an authorized user can be a huge boost.

When I was in high school my sister added me as an authorized user on her Bank of America credit card. By the time my 18th birthday rolled around I had a two-year credit history and got approved for the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express. It worked out well for me and because I didn't use the card for crazy spending sprees my sister's credit wasn't negatively impacted.

It takes responsible people on both sides to mitigate possible negative impacts of adding an authorized user.

Should you open a joint account or add an authorized user?

The difference between a joint account and an authorized user comes down to liability. Joint account holders share liability for charges while authorized users do not. Primary cardholders can also limit the amount of credit an authorized user can utilize. Joint account holders together can access the full credit line.

Being a joint account holder may prevent you from qualifying for your own version of the same card in the future. For example my mom was added as a joint account holder to my dad's Chase Sapphire Preferred Card years ago. When she applied for her own card last year she was denied because Chase viewed her as already having the card. If she had been an authorized user (as opposed to a joint account holder) she would have qualified for her own card.

There isn't much of an upside to joint accounts other than lessening the burden of liability on the primary cardholder. Ideally you shouldn't be adding anyone to your credit card (as an authorized user or joint account holder) unless you trust them to use it responsibly.

Bottom line

Adding an authorized user can be widely beneficial to both parties. However it's important to be aware of the risks as the last thing you want to do is sour a relationship because of one person's financial irresponsibility. Only add an authorized user whom you completely trust to be responsible with your credit line and pay their share of the balance on time.

OpenSea partners with MoonPay to allow NFT purchases with bank cards Apple Pay and Google Pay.

Trading volumes have retreated since January’s record high with rising crypto prices of influence.

More diversified NFT payment options could decouple the NFT marketplace from the crypto market.

OpenSea has seen NFT trading volumes retreat since January’s all-time highs. The fall in trading volumes has coincided with an upward trend in cryptocurrency prices.

On Friday we reported recent monthly trading volume trends and the root causes of the marked decline in volumes. A link to the value of cryptocurrencies is evident when considering the trend in NFT trading volumes.

Rising crypto prices translate into more expensive NFTs where NFT prices are crypto-based. In March ETH rose by 12.4% and 8.6% in February.

A shift away from crypto pricing and payment could decouple the inverse relationship between NFTs and the crypto market.

OpenSea Partners with MoonPay to Allow Bank Card Payments

On Friday MoonPay announced a new partnership with OpenSea. OpenSea will use MoonPay’s NFT Checkout to give OpenSea users better access to NFTs.

As per Friday’s announcement

“The integration which will be rolled out in phases allows OpenSea users to easily purchase an NFT using a debit or credit card sidestepping the need to first acquire cryptocurrency. This simplifies the purchasing process and opens up the marketplace to a wider customer base.”

MoonPay added

“For the first time OpenSea customers will be able to purchase NFTs using a card through MoonPay’s NFT Checkout. Collectors can pay directly with major payment methods like MasterCard Visa Apple Pay and Google Pay.”

MoonPay’s co-founder and CEO said

“MoonPay’s mission is to unlock ownership and onboard the world to Web3. To be successful we have to make the process as simple as possible. MoonPay has done that for crypto. And now in partnership with OpenSea we’re doing it for NFTs as well.”

On Twitter MoonPay tweeted that OpenSea users will soon be able to buy NFTs with Visa Mastercard Apple Pay Google Play and more.

NFT Marketplaces Partner with Payment Platforms to Broaden Customer Base

In January MoonPay announced the launch of its NFT Checkout service.

MoonPay’s deal with OpenSea follows a partnership with NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway an OpenSea competitor.

This year Coinbase will also be entering the NFT space with the launch of CoinbaseNFT. Earlier this month FX Empire reported that Coinbase met with more than one hundred creators looking to expedite the launch of the NFT marketplace.

In January Coinbase announced a deal with Mastercard to allow users to buy NFTs using Mastercard credit and debit cards.

NFT Regulatory Scrutiny Likely to Intensify Near-Term

As more NFT marketplaces forge partnerships with payment providers regulatory scrutiny could become a factor.

Since the start of the year the NFT space has seen a marked increase in illicit activity. Plagiarism NFT hacks wash trading money laundering and rug pulls are some of the many issues that the NFT space contends with today.

Allowing users to purchase NFTs with credit or debit cards will likely force regulators to introduce measures to protect investors. Such an outcome could initially hurt the NFT marketplace before demand returns.

This week EU lawmakers voted in favor of KYC for ‘private crypto wallets’ that could extend to crypto exchanges. Regulators may well target the NFT space next.

But if you're hoping to skip the crowds it might be in your best interest to opt for a fall trip to Europe.

Not only are hotels cheaper and attractions less crowded but you might also be able to take advantage of a special sweet spot award: American Airlines' 45000-mile off-peak economy award.

If you travel to Europe between Nov. 1 – Dec. 14 this year you'll save 25% on the usual redemption rate. With American's sizeable route network between the U.S. and Europe you'll also have many options that don't involve hefty taxes and fuel surcharges.

Here's everything you need to know about American AAdvantage off-peak award tickets to Europe:

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

Why it's special

An economy class award ticket to Europe normally costs around 60000 miles round-trip. Redeeming just 45000 AAdvantage miles is a significant discount. Thanks to American not adding fuel surcharges to its own flights it's possible to book these awards with minimal taxes and fees. You'll pay just $5.60 out of pocket on a one-way flight that departs from the U.S. to Europe.

This award is even more attainable due to how easily you can earn AAdvantage miles. In fact you can book this award with just a single credit card sign-up bonus. More on that later.

How to book this award

The great thing about this American Airlines sweet spot award to Europe is that you can book it online in minutes. Award availability is also great in the fall when travel demand tends to be lower. Here's how to book this award step-by-step:

Step 1: Log into your account

While you can search award space without logging in doing so saves you an extra step when you're ready to book. You can log in by heading to aa.com and selecting ""login"" on the upper right corner of the homepage.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

Step 2: Enter your trip information

After you log in you'll be redirected to the AA home page. That's where you'll enter your trip information. You can book this award as either a one-way or round-trip. Be sure to check off the ""Redeem miles"" box.

Step 3: Confirm your travel dates

You can look through all the available flight options on the search results page and change your date if you can't find saver award space.

(Screenshot courtesy of aa.com)

You can choose the ""calendar"" function for a more extensive search and find availability across several months.

(Screenshot courtesy of aa.com)

When selecting a flight keep an eye out for any abnormally high taxes. These tend to appear on flights with British Airways segments transiting through London.

Step 4: Confirm and pay

Once you've found your flights you can proceed with redeeming your award. If you're logged in most of the fields will be pre-filled and you'll need to remember to enter your Global Entry PASSID and pay for your flight. Ideally you'd use a credit card that offers bonus miles on airline spending to pay the taxes and fees.

(Screenshot courtesy of aa.com)

You can transfer points from Bilt Rewards to American at a 1:1 transfer ratio if you're short on American miles. Alternatively you can transfer Marriott Bonvoy points to American at a 3:1 transfer ratio with a 5000 mile bonus added to every 60000 points transferred. This means that 60000 Marriott points equal 25000 airline miles.

Or if you're really in a pinch you can buy miles. That can work out favorably if you're buying them during a sale but it can take several days for your miles to post.

The good news is that American Airlines does allow you to put award tickets on hold for up to seven days. That should be enough time to process any mileage purchases.

How to earn points for this award

If you want to earn AAdvantage miles for an off-peak economy award ticket to Europe you have plenty of time to do. A credit card sign-up bonus is the fastest way to accrue 45000 AAdvantage miles. Both Citi and Barclay issue co-branded American Airlines credit cards with welcome bonuses of 50000 miles or higher. The spending requirements on these cards are also reasonable with the Aviator Red Card requiring just a single purchase.

Citi® / AAdvantage® Platinum Select® World Elite Mastercard®

Sign-up bonus: Earn 50000 bonus miles after you spend $2500 on purchases within the first three months of account opening.

Bottom line

American Airlines' off-peak economy class awards to Europe are a great way to maximize AAdvantage miles. Not only are these awards cheap and easy to book online but you can earn the required AAdvantage miles fairly easily.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0dWZmLmNvLm56L2J1c2luZXNzLzEyODIwNTcwMi9tYW5zLWNyZWRpdC1zY29yZS13cmVja2VkLWJ5LWlkZW50aXR5LWZyYXVkLWFuZC1sZW5kZXJzLWluYWN0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man's credit score wrecked by identity fraud and lender's inaction,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbWFpbmx5bWlsZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMDIvdXAtdG8tMTMtbXBkLWF0LTI4MC1rcmlzLW1lcmNoYW50cy1pcy1ub3ctYS15ZWFyLXJvdW5kLWVhcm4tcmF0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Up to 13 mpd at 280 Kris+ merchants is now a year-round earn rate,"Kris+ has made 3 mpd 6 mpd and 9 mpd the default earning rates at all its merchants allowing you to net up to 13 mpd in total year-round when you pay with the right credit card.

Back in August 2021 SIA’s “lifestyle app” Kris+ launched by far its most generous miles earning offer yet with fantastic enhanced miles earn rates of up to 9 mpd initially running until the end of November 2021 at over 230 merchants across Singapore including dining wellness and retail outlets.

ADVERTISEMENT

The promotion was then given a generous extension through to the end of March 2022 but great news is that Kris+ has now made these the default year-round earning rates with no expiry date meaning that you’ll earn only one of three rates when making in-store purchases through the Kris+app.

Kris+ year-round earning rates

Old Earn Rate New Earn Rate Merchants More than 1 mpd 9 mpd 134 1 mpd 6 mpd 151 Less than 1 mpd 3 mpd 3

That means this great deal offering triple miles or more in some cases compared to pre-August 2021 rates is now a permanent fixture!

At Harvey Norman for example the earn rate before August 2021 was 0.33 mpd but is now fixed at 3 mpd nine times better than the former return!

Kris+ year-round earning / rebate rates

Don’t be too confused – Kris+ continues to market miles earning as “up to 6% instant rebates” which is true since the top earn rate is equivalent to 6 cents per dollar when you use your KrisPay miles in-app against future purchases (9 x 0.67 cents).

For our readers however we know that’s not where the value lies – you should be transferring your KrisPay miles earned immediately into the KrisFlyer programme for flight redemptions not redeeming them for 0.67 cents a piece.

6% cash rebate using KrisPay miles is more like 17% rebate against a future Business Class flight! (Photo: MainlyMiles)

The deal also stacks with up to 4 mpd when you make in-app payment with the right credit card including the HSBC Revolution at selected merchants for up to 13 mpd total earning which is a great rate to enjoy all year round.

How to earn miles when purchasing

Since September 2021 in-app payments have been the only way to earn Kris+ miles when purchasing in-store at an earning partner.

The process is straightforward just scan the merchant’s QR code and make payment using Apple Pay or Google Pay with your linked credit card.

The app then credits your miles instantly.

Kris+ earn rates by merchant

Here’s a full list of Kris+ earning partners and their new earn rates compared to what you used to earn previously before the August 2021 hike.

We’ve split the merchants into five categories; Dining Activities Retail Services and Wellness. We have then listed them best-to-worst in terms of earn rate within each category.

The Kris+ earn rate at Challenger stores was hiked from 0.1 mpd to 0.5 mpd in 2021. It’s now 3 mpd!

Which card to use

As you probably already know with Kris+ you’ll earn KrisPay miles for your transaction (which you then can and should convert into KrisFlyer miles) on top of the usual points you’ll get when using your best credit card to make payment.

ADVERTISEMENT

Where possible you’ll want to be using a credit card offering a 4 mpd bonus rate when making payment at these merchants which you’ll then earn separately and in addition to up to 9 mpd through Kris+.

The following cards will earn at their bonus rate between 3 mpd and 4 mpd for spend in the specific MCCs listed. You can reference the participating merchant tables above to check the MCC before choosing which card to use.

Don’t use your Citi Rewards card to make payment with Apple Pay or Google Pay on Kris+ since online transactions using this card specifically exclude mobile wallet payments and will therefore earn at the basic rate of 0.4 mpd.

Unsure?

If you’re not sure whether your bonus miles credit card is eligible for the merchant of your choice our advice is to use your best card for general spend miles accrual especially if the transaction is substantial.

For smaller amounts you may wish to take the chance but remember most bonus category spend credit cards earn just 0.4 mpd when you make transactions that the bank decides don’t qualify.

Stacking example

Let’s say you make an S$80 purchase at ALDO a 6 mpd merchant with Kris+ and pay in-app using your HSBC Revolution card.

Total earning for the transaction will be:

480 KrisPay miles (S$80 x 6) awarded instantly

80 HSBC Reward Points awarded instantly

720 HSBC Reward Points awarded at the end of the following month

The 800 HSBC Reward Points you’ll accrue in total are equivalent to 320 KrisFlyer miles and the 480 KrisPay miles can be instantly converted 1:1 into KrisFlyer miles for a total earning of 800 KrisFlyer Miles (10 mpd).

Don’t forget to transfer straight to KrisFlyer miles

KrisPay miles earned through Kris+ can only be transferred to your KrisFlyer account within 7 days of the transaction. To do so simply tap on the “Transfer to KrisFlyer” button which will appear on the miles earned confirmation screen or transaction details screen.

You can do so later (within 7 days) but why wait?

Remember that KrisPay miles earned per transaction can only be transferred to your account in their entirety. If you earned 100 KrisPay miles from a single Kris+ transaction for example the full 100 KrisPay miles must be transferred to your KrisFlyer account. If you have already spent some of your KrisPay miles earned a partial transfer option is not available.

We therefore recommend transferring to KrisFlyer immediately following any Kris+ earning transaction in case you either forget or make a mistake later.

Makan+

Kris+ has also recently launched Makan+ a restaurant reservation portal powered by Chope which allows you to accrue 100 KrisPay miles for each attended reservation at over 1000 restaurants across Singapore.

Miles are awarded the month following your booking and crucially can be transferred directly into your KrisFlyer account within 7 days of crediting in the Kris+ app.

There is no cap on the number of monthly reservations you can make this way which should allow a decent accrual throughout the year when booking restaurants you were probably heading to anyway.

Summary

You’ll now earn one of only three rates when paying in-store at over 280 Kris+ retailers across Singapore; 3 mpd 6 mpd or 9 mpd.

These are all attractive bonuses on top of your credit card earning (up to 4 mpd) but the good news is almost all merchants are in the more generous 6 mpd or 9 mpd categories.

There are over 140 options to choose from in the dining category alone and plenty of credit cards awarding 3 to 4 mpd rates for restaurant payments (mostly MCC 5812) to stack with your Kris+ earning.

Over 140 dining partners are Kris+ partners all at 6 mpd or 9 mpd earning rates including Perch at Jewel. (Photo: Perch)

Do be careful not to use Kris+ in-app payment via Apple Pay or Google Pay with the Citi Rewards cards since you’ll only earn 0.4 mpd.

At retailers offering the top earn rate you’ll pick up a total haul of 13 mpd including your credit card points in many cases but even with a decent general spend card offering 1.2 mpd on local transactions you can still net a very attractive 10.2 mpd during this offer.

Remember to transfer your KrisPay miles immediately into the KrisFlyer programme after earning since if they become partially used by mistake or you forget after 7 days they’ll be stuck in the Kris+ app where their value is dismal (6% cashback sounds generous but 17% value-back against future redemptions is much better!).

Spain and Germany will face off in the headline act of the group stages at the 2022 World Cup after the draw for the tournament was made in Doha on Friday.

Group E is undoubtedly the most intriguing with the Spanish and Germans joined by Japan and either Costa Rica or New Zealand with their deciding playoff match scheduled for June 13 or 14.

Germany will certainly be hoping the match will be nothing like the previous meeting between the two nations as Spain ran riot in a 6-0 victory during the Nations League in 2020.

Host nation Qatar will play Ecuador in the opening day’s third match after their World Cup opener was moved to better suit TV audiences in the South American nation. The two are also joined by the Netherlands and Senegal in Group A.

Qatar has relatively recent experience of playing South American nations after being invited to the 2019 Copa America. The Qataris acquitted themselves well making Argentina work hard for a 2-0 win and earning a well-deserved pointed against Paraguay.

France winners of the 2018 and 1998 World Cups were drawn into Group D with Denmark Tunisia and the winner of an Intercontinental play-off – either Australia United Arab Emirates or Peru.

Group B also offers up a number of interesting clashes with 2018 semifinalists England facing the USA Iran and one of Wales Scotland or Ukraine.

The last time England faced the USA at a World Cup was back in 2010 – and it’s a match that still gives English fans nightmares.

A calamitous error from then goalkeeper Rob Green gifted the Americans an equalizer after Steven Gerrard had opened the scoring for England.

Ghana has also been offered a change of revenge of sorts after being drawn in Group H alongside Uruguay.

In 2010 Luis Suarez infamously used his hands to block Dominic Adiyiah’s goalbound effort on the line in the dying seconds of their quarterfinal.

Asamoah Gyan missed the subsequent penalty – resulting in Suarez running down the tunnel in celebration – and Uruguay eventually reached the semifinals after a penalty shootout.

Portugal with Cristiano Ronaldo likely appearing at his last World Cup and South Korea complete Group H in what will perhaps be one of the trickier groups to predict.

Qatar 2022 will also likely be Lionel Messi’s last World Cup for Argentina. Like Ronaldo the 34-year-old has never won the World Cup but came agonizingly close in 2014 losing out to Germany in the final.

Under Lionel Scaloni the Argentines are in a considerably better place than they were four years ago in Russia and will certainly be confident of advancing out of group that includes Mexico Poland and Saudi Arabia.

Canada’s reward for qualifying for a first World Cup in 36 years is a showdown against two of European football’s leading protagonists in recent years. Belgium long-time world No. 1 until recently being dethroned by Brazil and 2018 finalists Croatia will provide stern tests.

So too will Morocco who boast talented stars such as Chelsea’s Hakim Ziyech and PSG’s Achraf Hakimi.

Friday’s ceremony was presented by actor Idris Elba and sports broadcaster Reshmin Chowdhury and was attended by 2000 guests.

The draw itself was led by former players Carli Lloyd Jermaine Jenas and international sports presenter Samantha Johnson.

They were helped by a number of football greats notably Brazil’s Cafu German Lothar Matthäus Iran’s Ali Daei Jay-Jay Okocha of Nigeria and Australian Tim Cahill.

None of the three teams — the United States Mexico and Canada — could be drawn together in the same group thanks to the geographic rules crafted by FIFA to create more intrigue and save intra-continental matchups for the knockout stages.

The United States was drawn into Group B alongside England Iran and the undetermined UEFA playoff qualifier creating plenty of intrigue around the U.S. and its history against European opponents specifically England. Mexico was pulled into Group C with Argentina Poland and Saudi Arabia as matchups against Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski loom. Canada meanwhile was placed into Group F with Belgium Croatia and Morocco.

So which of the three CONCACAF giants will have the best tournament? Projecting this event can be extremely difficult but there are ways to parse out which team could advance the farthest.

WORLD CUP DRAW BREAKDOWNS:

Group A | Group B | Group C | Group D

Group E | Group F | Group G | Group H

Who does the USA Canada Mexico play at the World Cup?

The United States was drawn into Group B alongside Pot 1 giants England a team on a 22-match unbeaten streak.

U.S. head coach Gregg Berhalter called it a ""great draw"" and expressed excitement at matching up against the Group B teams while the English media expressed an air of relief at what it called the ""Group of Life.""

The matchups will be tough as any World Cup games are but ultimately the U.S. should have a good chance to escape the group with a second-place finish even with a loss to England.

Mexico meanwhile pulled an extremely difficult Group C. El Tri will play a pair of world-class strikers in Robert Lewandowski and Lionel Messi while a final game against Saudi Arabia could be Mexico's only chance at a win in group stage play.

It will probably take at least a draw if not a win against an experienced Poland side for Mexico to advance which could make things extremely difficult.

Canada drawn from Pot 4 was placed with Belgium Croatia and Morocco. Like the United States Canada was drawn into a group with two European sides which always makes life difficult. Still Croatia is beatable not what the 2018 World Cup finalists once were while a result against Morocco could also be on the cards.

A game against Belgium is always a tough task but Canada's counter-attack style could be perfect against a possession-oriented team like Belgium.

How will the USA do at the 2022 World Cup?

The United States has a tough draw but it's still manageable. A matchup with England will be highly anticipated but even if that game ends in a defeat the U.S. still should have a shot at winning its other two matches and exiting the group.

The unknown of the UEFA playoff qualifier presents mystery and a matchup with Wales could be an extremely challenging Pot 4 game but the U.S. will like its chances against whoever escapes that knockout tournament with a World Cup spot.

A kicker for the U.S. in this tournament is its potential Round of 16 opponent. Should the U.S. secure a top-two spot in the group and reach the knockout stage it would meet a Group A opponent in the first knockout match. Group A does not feature a true Pot 1-caliber team meaning that if the U.S. finishes second in its group and draws the Group A winner in the Round of 16 a strong yet beatable opponent like the Netherlands or Senegal would await rather than an upper-echelon team like Brazil France or Argentina.

The quarterfinals are a reachable goal for the United States.

How will Canada do at the 2022 World Cup?

Placed into Group F for its first World Cup in 36 years Canada has an excellent opportunity to escape the group and reach the knockout stage.

Croatia reached the 2018 World Cup final and will be the second-favorites to reach the knockout stage alongside Belgium but the team is ripe for an upset. Recent draws with Slovenia and Slovakia plus losses to Spain Belgium and England last year prove this team is not the top side it once was.

Morocco is also a beatable team for Canada and while the team had a stunningly good defensive record through 2021 the Atlas Lions conceded two goals to defensive-minded Egypt in the Africa Cup of Nations and drew 1-1 with DR Congo in their first World Cup qualifying leg in March.

Finally while a game against second-ranked Belgium is a formidable task it's also a good matchup for Canada stylistically and the likes of Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David should be able to feast on the counter. There are enough points available for Canada to have a chance at reaching the knockout stage.

Sadly in the knockout round a matchup with a Group E participant is on the cards which means a possible matchup with either Spain or Germany which would likely mark the end of Canada's journey.

MORE: Can Messi win the World Cup? Argentina route to Qatar 2022 final

How will Mexico do at the 2022 World Cup?

Mexico has the toughest draw of any of the three CONCACAF automatic qualifiers with a spot in Group C.

While Saudi Arabia is considered one of the weaker sides in the tournament El Tri will still need a result against either Lionel Messi and Argentina or Robert Lewandowski to claim a spot in the knockout stage.

Argentina won the 2021 Copa America to give Messi his first major international trophy but the team still does have weaknesses for Mexico to exploit. Still a win or even a point from that match are unlikely so the match with Poland will be the critical game.

Poland led by Lewandowski plus experienced veterans like Wojciech Szczesny and Kamil Glik had a difficult Euro 2020 campaign but revived its fortunes in World Cup qualifying and topped Sweden in the playoff Path C final to confirm a place in Qatar. The team is certainly beatable as the likes of Hungary and Slovakia have proven over the last year but it will take a high-quality performance.

Should Mexico advance to the knockout stage a meeting with France or Denmark could be on the cards but it seems unlikely that El Tri will make it that far.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyaWNidXp6LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0LW5ld3MvMTIxNzkwL3VtcGlyZXMtYXJlLXBlb3BsZS10b2_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Umpires are people too,"BANGLADESH TOUR OF SOUTH AFRICA 2022 Umpires are people too Telford Vice Share Tweet

Marais Erasmus and Adrian Holdstock aren't having the best of games at Kingsmead ©AFP

Whether he is meeting dictators or descendants Marais Erasmus wears the same smile. It is wide and warm spreads in a gentle curve below his twinkling eyes and suits his generally genial demeanour like the ring of a bell does a bicycle. He has the comfortable bearing of a middle-aged cherub plainly content with life love and everything else.

Erasmus is also the world's best umpire maybe the finest of his generation. He has won the David Shepherd Trophy awarded by the ICC to the year's best official in 2016 2017 and 2021 - as many times as Aleem Dar and Richard Kettleborough. Only Simon Taufel who reeled off five consecutive wins from 2004 to 2008 has claimed the prize more often.

Erasmus stood in the quarter-finals at the 2011 and 2015 men's World Cups. He was the television official in the semi-finals and final of the latter tournament and on the field in the semi-finals and final four years later - as he was at the men's 2017 Champions Trophy 2016 World T20 and 2021 T20 World Cup and the 2010 2012 and 2014 women's World T20s. Since he made his international debut in a men's T20I between South Africa and Australia at the Wanderers in February 2006 he has featured in 71 Tests 105 ODIs and 53 T20Is.

Clearly besides being a thoroughly good bloke the man knows what he's doing. So what's happened at Kingsmead these past four days? Five of Erasmus' decisions have been overturned on review and three of the four that have remained intact have survived only by dint of umpire's call. Another a not out after an inswinger from Khaled Ahmed rapped Keegan Petersen on the back pad before lunch on Sunday (April 3) wasn't sent upstairs. DRS said the ball untouched by Petersen's bat or gloves would have nailed the stumps.

Before this match 69 of Erasmus' 264 reviewed decisions in Tests had been reversed - or 26.14% around average for elite umpires. So far at Kingsmead he's got it wrong five times out of nine or 55.56%. Only two of the nine - those that weren't put in the umpire's call category - can be considered conclusively correct.

Adrian Holdstock Erasmus' partner who is standing in his fifth Test has been more successful. Five of his eight reviewed decisions have stuck - one of them thanks to umpire's call - and two have been undone. He also decided Najmal Hossain Shanto had not edged Simon Harmer near the end of Sunday's play. South Africa did not review. Again the gizmo proved everyone wrong. Holdstock fell victim to the same thing in the first innings when DRS showed Petersen had edged Taskin Ahmed.

Even so there is cause if not for concern then for questioning. In all in this match that's 11 incorrect calls - including the three that fooled the umpires as well as the fielding team - and three others that were only marginally right. Erasmus and Holdstock are fine umpires but they are both South African. Were they guilty of making hometown decisions? Shakib al Hasan seems to have thought so. From his home in the US he tweeted: ""I think it's time for ICC to [go] back to neutral umpires as the Covid situation is OK in most cricket-playing countries."" That was after Erasmus had given Dean Elgar not out on Taskin Ahmed's leg-before shout after lunch on Sunday - and had to change his decision on review.

Shakib should have known better: the number of overturned decisions in the match is evenly split at 4-4 in respect of which team they have favoured. Thus Erasmus and Holdstock are owed an apology by Shakib. Given his troubled sometimes downright awful history with umpires they should not expect it to arrive anytime soon.

Asked during a press conference what suddenly fallible umpiring by two of the best in the business no less did to players' confidence South Africa batting consultant Justin Sammons offered an impeccable forward defensive: ""Everybody's human and everybody in the changeroom respects them. It's not an easy job. We've just got to get on with our business. We've got to control what's in our hands and block out any uncontrollables. That's an uncontrollable. It's important that we focus on our job at hand.""

He's right of course. If players' blunders are accepted as part of the game why not umpires'? Instead officials get the short end of the stick. After the world has seen they have got it wrong they are required to keep calm and continue as if nothing untoward has happened. Contrast that with the solace Wiaan Mulder was able to take on Thursday after he edged the first ball he faced bowled by Khaled Ahmed to gully. Mulder retreated to the shadows of the dugout where he remained for 20 minutes and more with the look of a jilted lover on his face.

Like players umpires are also subject to the swings and roundabouts of poor and good form. Erasmus and Holdstock also stood together in the pivotal Newlands Test in January. Of the 11 decisions Elgar and Virat Kohli reviewed only four were changed. Maybe they aren't having the best of games at Kingsmead but that doesn't make them bad umpires. Indeed Holdstock has had just six of the 19 decisions that have been referred during his Test career declared invalid. That's a success rate of 68.42% - well above average.

None of the errors committed at Kingsmead have been blatant. But especially in the case of the more experienced Erasmus who has been a model of umpiring excellence for almost his entire career they have stuck out.

With Bangladesh having lost three of their top four for eight runs in pursuit of a now near impossible target that will be 263 runs away when they resume on Monday the umpires' mistakes are unlikely to have a serious influence on the outcome of the match.

And Erasmus' smile the same one he wore at a reception hosted by in the words of the invitation ""His Excellency Mahindra Rajapaksa President of Sri Lanka"" in Colombo during the 2007 men's World Cup and the same one he flashed in Cape Town airport's arrivals hall at a couple of disembarking acquaintances while he waited for one of his sons to appear through the doors will shine on. So it should.

Socceroos drawn into World Cup group with France Denmark AGAIN,"Australia will face France Denmark and Tunisia in Group D if it qualifies for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

The Socceroos - or rather a placeholder representing them UAE and Peru - were drawn out of pot four as part of a lengthy ceremony in Doha Qatar on Saturday morning.

One of those three nations will qualify via the inter-confederation playoffs to be held in June.

Remarkably it means either Australia or Peru could be in a group with two of the teams they faced at Russia 2018 - France and Denmark.

In that tournament the group of four was Australia Peru France and Denmark with the latter two qualifiying. Tunisia the lowest-ranked team from Pot 3 replaces at least one of those former two nations this time.

Australia’s first match would be against the reigning champions France.

By the time Australia was drawn it had two options left: the Group D it received or Group F where it would have joined Belgium Morocco and Croatia.

Socceroos coach Graham Arnold said the team would be inspired by a chance at revenge as it chases qualification for the tournament.

“(Group D) brings back memories from 2018 and playing France the winners in 2018 and having Denmark in the same group – the only difference is Tunisia” Arnold said.

“Obviously it is one step at a time for us and it is all about the play-offs first and foremost but it is an exciting group.”

“They (Socceroos players) will be back at their clubs and they will be seeing the draw today. Some of the boys that were there in 2018 would like revenge and I am pretty sure that they will all be excited.”

Asian rivals Japan were arguably one of the unluckiest countries joining Group E with Spain Germany and either Costa Rica or New Zealand.

England will be happy with its draw getting USA Iran and one of Wales Scotland or Ukraine with it in Group B.

The opening match of the World Cup will pit Group A’s Qatar against Ecuador with Senegal and Netherlands fancying their chances of making it out of that quartet.

MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtcm9zdGVyLzIwMjQvNS82LzI0MTQ5ODc1L2NvdWxkLXN0ZWVsZXJzLWZvdXJ0aC1yb3VuZC1pb2wtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWZpbmQtaGlzLXdheS10by10aGUtc3RhcnRpbmctbGluZXVwLWluLTIwMjQtbmZs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024,"The Steelers used their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft toward the continued overhaul of the offensive line by selecting tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier. Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

Graeme McCormick who stood to become SNP president in 2023 earlier claimed he could gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

However McCormick’s decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Swinney the former deputy first minister of Scotland as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down. The deadline for nominations is noon on Monday.

McCormick said he reached the nomination threshold of 100 signatures but chose to back Swinney after a “lengthy and fruitful conversation” and said this could be a “fresh start”.

In a statement on Sunday night he said: “John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.

“This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I’m sure that John’s determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

“I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney’s nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.”

McCormick’s supporters had argued it would have been undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. He won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution over mounting a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson earlier attacked Swinney for criticising the planned challenge and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was going up against him.

Swinney who described himself as the candidate to unite the party after a “difficult” few years said an election contest would delay the SNP’s essential rebuild. But he signalled he would win any potential contest telling Sky News that party members “probably know the outcome” between the two potential candidates.

His call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.

Once Swinney is named the next SNP leader he will have to win a subsequent vote in Holyrood later in the week to become Scotland’s first minister.

The SNP said it does not comment on such matters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L3NucC1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWNoYWxsZW5nZXItZ3JhZW1lLW1jY29ybWljay1wdWxscy1vdXQtb2YtcmFjZS0xMzEzMDMwMtIBZGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2FtcC9zbnAtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1jaGFsbGVuZ2VyLWdyYWVtZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stcHVsbHMtb3V0LW9mLXJhY2UtMTMxMzAzMDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Swinney set to become next SNP leader and Scottish first minister as rival quits race,"John Swinney appears set to become Scotland's next first minister after Graeme McCormick pulled out of the race to become SNP leader.

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

What direction will the SNP take?

Earlier on Sunday Mr Swinney warned potential challengers from entering the race saying it would delay the party from ""rebuilding"".

""My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP. I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence"" he told Sky's Trevor Phillips.

Graeme McCormick a well-known party activist who stood to become SNP president in 2023 claimed he would gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

His supporters argue it would be undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. If one does take place Swinney will not be appointed as first minister until late May.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson posted on X on Sunday that he had already obtained the 100 signatures required and was planning to hand them in to the SNP “in person”.

Lawson also attacked Swinney for criticising the move and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was challenging him.

“So Graeme McCormick has succeeded in getting the nominations he needed. Disappointed that JS [Swinney] has already had a dig at him before nominations even close for daring to challenge him. He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea?”

McCormick some of whose allies want the Scottish government to mount a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

Nominations to succeed Humza Yousaf as SNP leader close at noon on Monday. If another candidate crosses the nominations threshold and forces a contest Yousaf is expected to remain in post and as Scotland’s first minister until a winner is declared.

McCormick was very confident he would gather the signatures before the deadline after canvassing for support at an independence rally in Glasgow organised by All Under One Banner the Sunday Herald newspaper reported.

Swinney who has been expecting to be confirmed as the new SNP leader on Monday afternoon and be voted in as first minister this week warned on Sunday that a contest would delay his efforts to rebuild the party and put its deep divisions on public display.

“I think it would be better if we just got on with things that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength” he told BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show. “We had a lot of strains around a couple of issues in parliament and I think we’ve just had a rough couple of years.

An unopposed coronation would not be the SNP’s first: Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in November 2014 without a contest.

For those who aren't familiar with the McDonald's Sprite banter people often point out how the fast-food chain's Sprite packs a ""spicier"" kick compared to the branded beverage carried by other stockists.

Hilarious claims even go as far as to say the drink is ""powerful"" off taste alone.

So of course the mere thought of a canned McDonald's Sprite resulted in endless internet reactions where tweeters pointed out the almighty soda's potentially detonator-worthy contents.

A three-year-old clearly erroneous decision threatens to bankrupt protest organizers across the political spectrum. But multiple courts keep passing the case among themselves like a hot potato rather than correcting an obvious error.

At the center of this years-long saga is a conservative federal appeals court’s 2019 decision in Doe v. Mckesson. If it is allowed to stand — or worse if it is embraced by the Supreme Court — it could potentially chill all public protest in the United States by subjecting the organizers of protests to crippling liability.

That 2019 decision moreover is merely the most alarming chapter in a case involving a tragically injured police officer a prominent civil rights activist a Trump judge who publicly recanted his own effort to restrict First Amendment rights and at least four different courts — including the Supreme Court of the United States.

The most recent development is a March decision by the Louisiana Supreme Court that effectively breathes life back into the Mckesson litigation after a US Supreme Court decision gave the state supreme court an opportunity to shut it down. The likely result of that Louisiana decision is months or even years more of litigation — all of which could end in a crippling blow to all political protest in the United States.

The facts of Mckesson are straightforward. DeRay Mckesson is a prominent civil rights activist and a leader in the Black Lives Matter movement. In 2016 he helped lead a protest near the Baton Rouge Police Department building in response to the fatal police shooting of Alton Sterling.

During that protest an unknown assailant — who is not DeRay Mckesson — threw a piece of concrete or similar object at a police officer who is identified in legal documents by the pseudonym “Officer John Doe.” Tragically Doe appears to have been very seriously injured by this assault. According to the Louisiana Supreme Court the officer was struck in the face and experienced “injuries to his teeth jaw brain and head along with other compensable losses.”

But given that the assailant is still unknown there is no one to pay those “compensable” damages.

Which brings us to the Fifth Circuit’s decision in this case. The conservative court held that Mckesson may be sued as the organizer of the protest. This decision isn’t just wrong it is obviously wrong and there is a Supreme Court case that explicitly protects protest leaders from these sorts of lawsuits.

The Court held in NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware (1982) that barring unusual circumstances that are not in play here “civil liability may not be imposed merely because an individual belonged to a group some members of which committed acts of violence.” When a group of people gather together in protest each individual member of the group is responsible for their own actions. But the First Amendment neither permits the group as a whole or the group’s leaders to be held liable for one individual’s illegal behavior unless the group or leader directly incited the illegal acts.

The reason why should be obvious. If protest leaders can be hauled into court — and potentially forced to pay out of their own pockets — for the actions of a single protest attendee then no sensible person will organize a protest. The personal financial risk is simply too great. And thus the First Amendment right to protest with wither away.

The Fifth Circuit’s decision is dead wrong

Most likely because the person who is actually legally responsible for Doe’s injuries remains unidentified Doe’s lawyers appear to be casting about for a defendant — any defendant — who could be sued to compensate Doe.

Their original complaint named Mckesson and “Black Lives Matter” as defendants. To be clear it did not name any particular organization whose name includes the words “Black Lives Matter” but instead appeared to target the entire Black Lives Matter movement as a whole — which is a bit like if someone injured at the January 6 attack on the Capitol had sued “Make America Great Again.”

Then at a later stage in the litigation Doe’s lawyers tried to add a Twitter hashtag #Blacklivesmatter as an additional defendant.

With respect to Mckesson the facts of Claiborne are in many material respects identical to the facts of this case. And the Claiborne decision precludes holding Mckesson liable for the actions of an unknown person who attended the Baton Rouge protest.

Claiborne involved a boycott of white businesses led by a Mississippi chapter of the NAACP. During the course of this boycott according to the Mississippi Supreme Court some individuals “engaged in acts of physical force and violence against the persons and property of certain customers and prospective customers” of these white businesses.

But the Supreme Court rejected the argument that either the NAACP or specific NAACP leaders who helped organize this boycott could be held liable for the violent actions of people who participated in the boycott.

Claiborne did lay out three circumstances when leaders of a protest may be held responsible for the actions of individual protesters. One is if a protest leader’s “public speeches were likely to incite lawless action” but Doe’s lawyers do not point to any statements by Mckesson that incited anyone to throw rocks at cops. Similarly Mckesson could be liable if he gave someone “specific instructions to carry out violent acts or threats” but Doe does not point to any such instructions from Mckesson.

Mckesson could also be held liable for the rock-thrower’s actions if he “authorized directed or ratified” this illegal act. But the Fifth Circuit admitted in its opinion that Doe “has not pled facts that would allow a jury to conclude that Mckesson colluded with the unknown assailant to attack Doe knew of the attack and ratified it or agreed with other named persons that attacking the police was one of the goals of the demonstration.”

In short had the Fifth Circuit followed the Supreme Court’s binding precedent in Claiborne it would have dismissed the case against Mckesson.

Instead the court invented a new exception to the First Amendment. To sue Mckesson Judge E. Grady Jolly wrote Doe was merely required to “plausibly allege that his injuries were one of the ‘consequences’ of ‘tortious activity’ which itself was ‘authorized directed or ratified’ by Mckesson in violation of his duty of care.” That is if Mckesson led protesters to commit any illegal act he risks being stripped of his First Amendment rights and held liable for subsequent illegal activity that results.

In this case Doe claims that Mckesson “directed the demonstrators to engage in the criminal act of occupying the public highway.” And that was enough according to the Fifth Circuit to strip Mckesson of his constitutional rights.

Occupying public streets is of course a common protest tactic used by many celebrated political movements — including the civil rights marches of the 1950s and 1960s.

The Fifth Circuit’s opinion moreover is so broadly worded that it could potentially strip any leader of any major protest of their First Amendment rights.

Recall that under the Fifth Circuit’s opinion a protest leader is potentially stripped of their constitutional rights if they authorize direct or ratify any illegal activity by protesters. This could be illegal activity central to an act of civil disobedience — say protesters who oppose mask mandates enter a government building maskless in defiance of a local ordinance — or it could potentially be something only tangentially related. A protest leader could potentially lose their First Amendment rights if they advise a bus carrying protesters to drive slightly above the speed limit in order to make it to the protest on time. Or if they advise a protester to park their car in a no-parking zone.

Indeed under the traditional common law rule someone who sets foot on another person’s land without their permission has typically committed the tort of trespass. So a protest leader could potentially lose their First Amendment rights if they encourage protesters to walk in a wide formation where a few of them occasionally spill over from the streets onto private property.

To be clear a protest leader is still responsible for their own actions. Someone who defies a mask mandate could potentially be prosecuted for refusing to wear a mask for example. But under Claiborne a protest organizer’s decision to violate one law does not normally permit them to be held liable for someone else’s decision to violate a completely different law.

The courts keep treating this case like a hot potato that needs to be passed to someone else

After the Fifth Circuit’s 2019 decision at least three different courts have had the opportunity to correct this error and restore Mckesson’s constitutional rights. But most of the judges who’ve touched this case refuse to take responsibility for it.

One notable exception is Judge Don Willett a Trump-appointed judge on the Fifth Circuit who initially joined Jolly’s opinion inventing a new limit on the First Amendment. Months after the Fifth Circuit’s original decision in Mckesson Willett published a rare and belated dissent admitting that his initial vote in this case was wrong.

“I disagree with the suggestion that directing any tort would strip a protest organizer of First Amendment protection” Willett wrote in his new dissent. He added that had the Fifth Circuit’s rule been in effect in the 1960s one of its victims would have been Martin Luther King Jr.

Dr. King’s last protest march was in March 1968 in support of striking Memphis sanitation workers. ... Dr. King’s hallmark was nonviolent protest but as he led marchers down Beale Street some young men began breaking storefront windows. The police moved in and violence erupted harming peaceful demonstrators and youthful looters alike. Had Dr. King been sued either by injured police or injured protestors I cannot fathom that the Constitution he praised as “magnificent” — “a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir” — would countenance his personal liability.

But neither Jolly nor the third judge on the panel Judge Jennifer Elrod joined Willett in acknowledging their error. Instead they issued a longer opinion explaining why they would still strip Mckesson of his First Amendment rights.

Mckesson’s lawyers asked the full Fifth Circuit to hear the case and effectively toss out Jolly’s decision — using a process known as “en banc” rehearing. But a majority of the court’s active judges must agree to take a case en banc and the court split 8-8 on whether to do so.

The case then made its way to the Supreme Court which did hand down a brief decision vacating Jolly’s opinion. But rather than putting the case to bed for good the Supreme Court merely ordered the Fifth Circuit to seek the Louisiana Supreme Court’s input on whether Louisiana law permits a suit against Mckesson. The Supreme Court avoided the question of whether Mckesson is protected by the First Amendment altogether.

In late March Louisiana's justices finally weighed in with all but one of them concluding that state law does permit the suit against Mckesson to move forward. Justice Piper Griffin the only Democrat on Louisiana’s highest court dissented writing that the majority’s decision “will have a chilling effect on political protests in general as nothing prevents a bad actor from attending an otherwise peaceful protest and committing acts of violence.”

And so because no court wants to take responsibility for correcting Jolly’s error Mckesson’s rights remain trapped in limbo. He and his lawyers can look forward to more months or even years of litigation before this case is resolved.

This long torturous process is unfair to Mckesson. It is unfair to Doe who deserves to know that his lawsuit cannot prevail under the Constitution. And it is unfair to anyone who exercises their constitutional right to protest.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Let the family know you are thinking of them

Dawn Rebecca Strawder

Memphis - Dawn Rebecca Strawder age 60 died March 28 2022 in Memphis Tennessee the city she chose for herself in 1974. From birth Dawn accompanied her mother to Cleveland Pittsburgh Bloomington. At an early age she could be found at protest marches back stage at dance performances or listening in at meetings of women's groups. When her mother completed a Master's Degree it was Dawn who made the decision to move to Memphis where more kids looked like her.

Dawn graduated from Hamilton High School. She loved theatre and while in school in Memphis worked behind the scenes on local productions. After returning to Memphis in the 90s she attended theatre regularly and could be found at parties passionately discussing what she'd just seen at Hattiloo.

She attended Clark Atlanta University and received a degree in Mass Communications. While there she hosted a weekly radio program featuring jazz.

Dawn had a deep knowledge of family and loved a good road trip. She combined these interests with annual drives to family reunions in both Maryland and Ontario Canada. Along the way she and whoever was in the car that year would stop at points of interest her favorite being Niagara Falls.

Dawn's culinary skills were legendary. In the tradition of her grandmother and great-grandmother she shared amazing baked goods with family and friends. Anything Dawn brought to the table was sure to disappear fast.

Dawn attended the Peter Cooper Unitarian Universalist Fellowship where weekly a variety of issues were discussed.

Water aerobics was one of Dawn's passions. For many years she would be up and in the water by 6:00 am to swim with her circle of aquatic friends.

A strong ally of the LGBTQ community Dawn was active in the Meristem Book Club and Seniors OUT for Coffee.

Dawn loved cats and will be missed by feline companion Sammi.

She worked for Medtronic for over 15 years her last position being that of buyer.

Dawn died following an eight-month battle with cancer. She was preceded in death by great grandmother Rebecca Holland Payne great-grandfather Brown Wesley Payne grandmother E. Payne Starling (Nana) great-grandmother Cora Sylvia Johnson grandmother H. Louise Ewing and father Leroy Whitfield Strawder II.

She is survived by her mother Maxine Starling Strawder. She also leaves her best friend Colette English and family and Dawn's Village.

A celebration of her life will be held at a later date.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzAyL2N1c3RvbWVycy1sb3ZlLXRoZXNlLTMtaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1jb21wYW5pZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Customers Love These 3 Healthcare Companies,"Net Promoter Scores can provide insights into customer satisfaction and possibly lead to market-beating returns.

Trying to predict where the market will go over the short term is next to impossible. But when you're searching for potentially profitable places to park your hard-earned cash you might want to start by considering companies with particularly happy customers. With this in mind let's look at three companies that clearly do please their customers based on a metric called the Net Promoter Score (NPS).

NPS is a metric that's based on people's responses to a single survey question along these lines: ""On a scale of 0 to 10 how likely would you be to recommend this company product or service to a friend or colleague?"" That key question is usually followed up with a question or three attempting to gauge why each respondent gave the answer that they did.

But it's that first question that counts. Those who respond with a 9 or 10 are classified as ""promoters"" -- customers who will keep coming back and more importantly who will enthusiastically recommend the business to others. Those whose answers are 6 or lower are the ""detractors"" -- folks who will disparage the company or its products. Subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters and you get the Net Promoter Score.

Obviously higher scores are better. They range from -100 to +100 and if a business's NPS is a negative number that's a problem. Any positive number though is at least good. According to the management consultants at Bain & Co. which invented the NPS a score above 20 is favorable above 50 is great and an 80 or above is world class.

And this gauge of customer loyalty also tends to forecast business growth -- which brings us to three healthcare companies that are overwhelmingly pleasing their customers based on this metric: 1Life Healthcare (ONEM) with an NPS of 90; Dexcom's (DXCM 1.00%) which scored an 83; and FIGS (FIGS -3.77%) which scored an 81.

1Life Healthcare

1Life Healthcare which does business under the name One Medical is keeping patients thrilled with its primary-care medical practices as evidenced by its eye-popping NPS of 90. The membership-based primary care platform grew its total member count by 34% in 2021 to 736000. In the process it grew its full-year revenue by 64%. And with such a high NPS it's no wonder One Medical's membership plans have a better than 90% retention rate.

The company helps keep its patients in above-average health too. Its offices were ranked first by the New York City Health Department for viral load suppression among HIV patients (a measure of controlled disease). One Medical's mental health services have been shown to drive a 50% reduction in severe anxiety. In diabetic patients One Medical's patients have reductions in average blood glucose levels that are twice what others have shown in publications. Clearly its model seems to be working well for patients.

The combination of quality healthcare and satisfied customers has driven growth and that's expected to continue. The company expects to end 2022 with 14% more members than at the beginning of the year and sees full-year net revenue landing in the $1.045 billion to $1.085 billion range -- roughly 70% higher than in 2021.

Despite all that growth Wall Street doesn't seem to appreciate the model. One Medical's shares are down almost 40% year to date -- and by almost 80% from their February 2021 peak -- making this stock an interesting watch list candidate.

Dexcom

Medical device company Dexcom also has a strong fanbase. Its popular G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system recently earned an NPS of 83 among the diabetic patients who use it. Those happy patients have led to ecstatic investors. Dexcom's shares are up by more than 500% in the last five years -- and by more than 4900% in the last 10 years.

Despite its size -- its market cap is in the neighborhood of $51 billion -- Dexcom continues to expand. Total revenue grew 23% in 2021 and in foreign markets sales grew by 54%. With the omicron COVID-19 surge largely in the rear-view mirror its sales force is starting to make it back into medical offices further driving device uptake. In addition the competition seems to be stumbling. In December rival Medtronic received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration regarding faults with its insulin pumps.

Adding to DexCom's tailwinds the American Diabetes Association recently stated that CGM can be useful for people with diabetes who require multiple daily injections of insulin. This almost doubles Dexcom's addressable market in the U.S. from 4 million to about 7 million. And the company believes new geographies will more than triple its total addressable market by the second half of 2023. In addition the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now estimates that 38% of adults in America -- 96 million people -- have pre-diabetes. Between that and over 40% of U.S. adults reporting undesired weight gain since the start of the pandemic the potential market for Dexcom is significant.

FIGS

Healthcare outfitter FIGS frequently draws comparisons to athleisure apparel maker Lululemon Athletica (LULU -1.38%) thanks to its stylish scrubs. And based on FIGS' NPS of 81 and Lululemon's score of 83 both companies are doing an excellent job of pleasing their customers. And scrubs maker FIGS has the growth to prove it.

With net revenue up 62% to $420 million in 2021 FIGS is firing on all cylinders. Its active customer base grew 46% to 1.9 million last year and net revenue per active customer rose by $22 year-over-year and by $39 over the last two years. It also increased its repeat customer revenues to 68% up from 62% in 2020. Plus its fledgling international business -- currently its only foreign markets are the U.K. Canada and Australia -- tripled in 2021 providing 7% of revenue. Management plans to enter new markets in 2022.

FIGS knows its customers well. It actually tailors its site to offer more personalized content to its consumers resulting in a higher conversion rate. In the fourth quarter these personalized experiences resulted in a conversion rate that was almost twice what it had been before it began using tailored content. Half of its new customers come back and buy again within a year. And if buyers purchase from FIGS in two consecutive years they are likely to stay loyal -- over 95% of those customers purchase from it again in year three.

Companies with high Net Promoter Scores are worth a second look

While a Net Promoter Score certainly isn't the only way to measure the outlook for a stock a strong number should certainly get investors' attention.

Companies whose scores are far higher than those of their peers have tended to well reward their shareholders over the years. While the market and individual share prices will always fluctuate a high NPS indicates the type of brand loyalty that can outlive short-term volatility.

Given how well they are satisfying their customers FIGS Dexcom and One Medical deserve consideration for investors' watch lists.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzaHViLmNvLm56L2hvbWUvcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMi8wNC91cHBlci1odXR0LWRhZC1zLXBsZWEtdG8tcGhhcm1hYy10by1jb3Zlci1mYW1pbHktcy01MjAwLWEteWVhci1iaWxsLWZvci1saWZlLWNoYW5naW5nLWRpYWJldGVzLWRldmljZXMuaHRtbNIBnwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzaHViLmNvLm56L2hvbWUvcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMi8wNC91cHBlci1odXR0LWRhZC1zLXBsZWEtdG8tcGhhcm1hYy10by1jb3Zlci1mYW1pbHktcy01MjAwLWEteWVhci1iaWxsLWZvci1saWZlLWNoYW5naW5nLWRpYWJldGVzLWRldmljZXMuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Upper Hutt dad's plea to Pharmac to cover family's $5200 a year bill for 'life-changing' diabetes devices,"A Kiwi teacher is calling for public funding for ""life-changing"" diabetes devices after being forced to stump up $200 a fortnight for basic care for him and his daughter.

Jared Summers is the Deputy Principal of Birchville School in Upper Hutt. He and his six-year-old daughter Sophie both have type 1 diabetes - an autoimmune condition which means the body doesn't create any insulin (or only very little amounts).

Summers spent most of his life managing his condition through finger prick blood sugar tests but after Sophie was diagnosed as a toddler he and his wife Rachel saved up to purchase a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).

A CGM attaches to the arm or stomach and gives an accurate blood glucose level in seconds through a digital sensor. It also shows whether levels are dropping or rising allowing users to prevent them going too high or low which can have serious consequences.

The CGM has been life-changing for Summers and his daughter. But there's a catch: the device is not funded by the Government and the basic version costs the family $200 a fortnight for both - an expense of $5200 each year.

Summers says he's very fortunate to be able to afford it but Kiwis who can't finance the device themselves shouldn't miss out.

""As a teacher I am on the go all the time and now I can just wave my phone over my arm and see my blood sugars rather than taking 30 seconds to a minute out to do a blood sugar check on my finger"" Summers told Newshub.

For Sophie the impacts have been even more pronounced. Not only has it allowed her the freedom to enjoy being a kid it's also given Summers and his wife peace of mind at night.

""When she was diagnosed we didn't have the CGM and she can't tell when she's going low. If I have a low in the night I wake myself up - my body knows - whereas she doesn't know those signs yet.",,,

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."
META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzAzL2JldHRlci1tZXRhdmVyc2Utc3RvY2stcm9ibG94LW9yLW1ldGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Metaverse Stock: Roblox or Meta?,"When two visions of the metaverse collide who comes out on top? David or Goliath?

Some say the metaverse is the next big thing akin to the internet in the 1990s or the smartphone in the 2000s. While the metaverse is still being built it's not too soon to invest in the companies that are shaping its future. Let's take a look at two of the most prominent metaverse stocks: Meta Platforms (META 3.04%) and Roblox (RBLX 2.22%).

Meta: An ambitious vision with major hurdles

No company has wagered more on the metaverse than that which is formerly known as Facebook. In October 2021 the tech company took the telling step of rebranding itself as Meta. In a founder's letter Mark Zuckerberg said that metaverse users will ""be able to do almost anything you can imagine...[such as] teleport instantly as a hologram to be at the office without a commute at a concert with friends or in your parents' living room to catch up.""

It's a big vision that comes at a steep cost. Meta reported fourth-quarter losses of $3.3 billion in its Reality Labs segment which is the division tasked with turning Zuckerberg's vision of the metaverse into a reality. Total yearly losses for Reality Labs were $10 billion in 2021 and the company expects those losses to continue -- and perhaps accelerate -- in the near term.

What's more the company is facing a steep uphill battle to ease fears about the metaverse particularly when it comes to public trust. As seen in the chart below a staggering 87% of U.S. adults have privacy concerns if Facebook (i.e. Meta) is a leader in the construction of the metaverse. Clearly Meta faces an enormous public relations challenge to convince users that its version of the metaverse will safeguard individuals' data and privacy.

Roblox: Keeping the metaverse fun

In contrast to Meta Roblox's vision of the metaverse is more lighthearted. Rather than striving to teleport someone into an office Roblox is more likely to transport users into a castle. This more modest vision presents an obvious benefit: It is already up and running. Unlike Meta which must build its vision of the metaverse from scratch Roblox offers users free entry to an online 3D world now.

The company partners with independent creators who build experiences for players to explore. Roblox generates revenue by selling Robux -- an in-game currency that allows players access to certain levels skins and items.

This particular model -- a sort of online sandbox that provides players with an ever-changing selection of role-playing adventures to experience with their real-life friends -- is particularly appealing to young people.

As noted above 38% of 10- to 20-year-olds have played a metaverse-style game in the past six months. This figure decreases with age; only 4% of those over the age of 50 have recently used Roblox or a similar proto-metaverse platform. As I've noted before Roblox's young user base is one of its best assets. As current Roblox players grow older and their disposable income increases Roblox will have greater opportunities to generate revenue from advertising or in-game transactions.

I prefer Roblox to Meta

With over 1.93 billion daily active users worldwide at the end of 2021 Meta has a tremendous head start in the race to rule the metaverse. Roblox in comparison had 49.5 million daily active users as of fourth quarter 2021. But the player in the lead doesn't always win the race. The major distrust that adults have of Meta especially in regards to the company's handling of personal data and privacy is an enormous hurdle for the company to overcome as it works to build the metaverse.

Moreover last year's $10 billion loss from Reality Labs is staggering. Roblox on the other hand currently has a market cap of $28.5 billion. It seems to me that Meta would have been wiser to have bought Roblox rather than building its own metaverse from scratch.

Roblox may not seem to have the most ambitious vision for the metaverse. In fact some might consider it an underdog. But in this race I'd rather put my money on the underdog.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9mYWNlYm9vay1tYWtlcy1hLWJpZy1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLWNoYW5nZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook Makes a Big Controversial Change,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/facebook-makes-a-big-controversial-change on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9mYWNlYm9vay1tYWtlcy1hLWJpZy1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLWNoYW5nZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5jcm9ubGluZS5vcmcvbmV3cy9vcGluaW9uL3NvdWwtc2VlaW5nL2NvbWZvcnQtdHdlZXRpbmctdGhyb3VnaC1sZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The comfort of tweeting through Lent,"For the last few years I have given up social media for Lent. Like a passenger leaving for a great adventure I announce my departure from all my social media platforms. One after the other sometimes with an accompanying image I tell friends and family that I am taking some time away to focus during Lent. This year was no different. I posted my obligatory departure message on Facebook and Instagram on Ash Wednesday but I kept delaying posting on my Twitter. Maybe it was because the message was so long that it would result in a lengthy tweet thread that people wouldn't read after the first two tweets. Perhaps it was because it was a Wednesday and I knew I wanted to live-tweet Lifetime's ""Married at First Sight"" later that evening. Ash Wednesday came and went and I found myself unable to leave Twitter. About a week and a half into Lent I woke up in the middle of the night. Unable to go back to sleep I scrambled for my phone in the dark and clicked on the Twitter app. The first tweet I saw was from a man who said that he was in the pit of sin and despair and could really use prayer. A few days later a woman tweeted that her husband left her and she would never see him again. A few days after that there was a flurry of tweets from medical school students who did not match on MATCH Day and were in despair of their futures. I've read tweets about people with suicidal ideations and saw a throng of people respond that they finally feel seen and not as abnormal as they thought they were. Daily there were tweets of people's life hits intertwined with their misses. Tragedies mingled with triumphs. For every tweeting action where someone shared a less than victorious facet of their life there were dozens hundreds sometimes thousands of reactions of people who stood in solidarity with those for whom life is no crystal-filtered photo. The more I paid attention to it the more Twitter didn’t seem like a black hole of keyboard gangsters and clap back queens but a social media platform where people were more transparent and vulnerable than not. I felt at home there more than I have on my other beloved platforms. But why? What makes it so different from the Meta platforms (Facebook and Instagram).

What tweeting through Lent has meant for me is holding space for people and taking their words seriously. Tweet this

In the weeks that led up to Lent I fell prey to the sin of comparison via social media posts because I felt many around me were accomplishing and achieving and I was doing nothing. I watched post after post of announcements of all kinds from panels with the who's who of my guild and new job announcements to new homes and cars. With each announcement I felt like I wasn't doing enough or anything. Of course it is not that I was doing nothing but that what I am doing in this season of life isn't for public consumption — and that I'm in the liminal space that many newly minted PhDs find themselves in. But social media has mediated our lives to the point that we must let everyone know that we are doing something because that makes us legible. Our image of doing something amplifies our worthiness on social media and in turn society. Our relationship to social media is increasingly about how we can demonstrate our labor and the fruits thereof. No longer is social media the place where people share simple thoughts and unfiltered images. It’s the space for unfiltered thoughts and highly filtered pictures. It’s a self-making machine that can feel like a pressure cooker to empathic souls trying to do more than fashion themselves into a brand for sale. Where does one belong if they don't always want to strike a perfect pose or post a cool flyer for their next seminar? Where do the people without energy or desire to filter themselves into smoothness go? Where do people go who don't want to be sold anything — or sold much? It seems to me that place is Twitter. I have come to realize that when all we have left are our words in front of perfect strangers some of us choose to use them well and to speak the truth of our lives. Twitter depends on our ability to communicate primarily with words. When only our words remain we begin to piece together the genuine parts of ourselves. We assemble the truer vestiges of ourselves that hide in the din of a million pictures and captions. We are as thrilled to announce accomplishments as we are devastated to announce failures and it seems to me we take more comfort in doing so because we don't need a well-manicured image and we are doing so before a cloud of strange(r) witnesses. These witnesses see our humanity unfettered by the need to be perfect only constrained by the need to be heard in a world full of noise.

As tech giants continue to build their metaverse platforms many questions are being raised about the future of our mental health.

2 Concerns over the metaverse's effects on mental health have been growing among experts

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has long been vocal about his plans for the ""metaverse"" – a virtual world comprising gaming social media augmented reality and cryptocurrency.

""The metaverse is the next evolution of social connection"" Meta writes on a webpage that also hosts a 13-part audio series detailing Zuckerberg's vision for the digital space.

This 'evolution' it appears is already here as companies like Microsoft Apple and Nvidia are already laying the groundwork for decentralized virtual spaces.

Now experts are seriously pondering just how Zuckerberg's plans for the future will affect the mental health of individuals some of who are already heavily integrated into an online world.

There is debate among experts

In the past tech and mental-health experts have been concerned about most new technologies and how they would impact our lives.

Today many experts say that these apprehensions were baseless because factors like genetics and socioeconomic standing are more significant to a person's well-being per The Wall Street Journal.

They argue that the metaverse too will get seamlessly integrated into our lives.

However others disagree stating that the concept of a metaverse is not only revolutionary but uncharted territory that will definitely present some challenges.

The debate is far from over but here's what some experts say now.

Spending too much time in the metaverse may be bad for you

Science has concrete evidence that links the overuse of digital technology to several mental health issues such as depression psychoticism and paranoid ideation according to a peer-reviewed article in Psychology Today.

Spending a lot of time in a digital environment can also result in someone preferring virtual spaces to reality.

This can ""negatively impact our ability to engage in non-virtual life whether it’s self-confidence or belonging or social anxiety"" Rachel Kowert research director at Take This a nonprofit focused on mental health in the video gaming community told The Wall Street Journal.

Similarly Jeremy Bailenson founding director of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab noted that there may be challenges when people spend a lot of time ""in a world in which everyone is just perfect and beautiful and ideal.""

Context is important

Nick Allen a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon said that the question shouldn't be how much time people are spending on the metaverse.

Instead he says it's more important to look at whether time spent in the metaverse promotes or hinders one's mental health.

""A young person who may be LGBT and who finds an online context where they can feel a sense of social support—we would predict that that would be a benefit for their mental health"" Allen said.

""On the other hand if using metaverse technologies replaces non-online behaviors that are healthy and supportive to mental health like appropriate exercise engagement in relationships in real life healthy sleep time spent in natural environments then they can be harmful.""

The metaverse may help some people

Many experts believe that the metaverse can have a positive impact on people – that is when used in a healthy way.

Dr. Daria Kuss Head of the Cyberpsychology Research Group at Nottingham Trent University told Dazed: ""We know that particular psychotherapy formats notably virtual reality exposure therapy can be fantastic tools to help individuals affected by a variety of phobias.""

Mental health issues like depression psychosis addiction eating disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder can be tackled using the metaverse ""by gradually exposing [people] to the triggering feared or trauma-producing stimulus in a safe space (like the virtual environment)” Dr. Kuss added.

Anna Bailie a Ph.D. candidate at the University of York who is researching mental health cultures on social media echoed Dr. Kuss' sentiments.

""The interactive nature of the metaverse could provide a different arena for online therapy to take place which may even improve access to therapy for disabled people with a better more life-like experience.""

However she also noted that the metaverse will ""likely divide people further in their access to technology and therapeutic support.""

""Having mental health treatment instantly available in the metaverse will likely benefit the people who already have access to it.”

Peter Etchells a professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University told the Wall Street Journal that he believes the metaverse can be a ""tremendous force for good in terms of keeping us connected"" if it is developed in an ethical way.

And while he acknowledged that things can go wrong he thinks we might miss a ""tremendous opportunity"" if we only focus on the negatives.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9uZnRzLXdlYjMtYW5kLXRoZS1tZXRhdmVyc2UtYXJlLWNoYW5naW5nLXRoZS13YXktc2NpZW50aXN0cy1jb25kdWN0LXJlc2VhcmNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NFTs Web3 and the metaverse are changing the way scientists conduct research,"Scientists can leverage blockchain tools such as smart contracts and tokens to improve collaboration in scientific endeavors between different stakeholders. This so-called decentralized science movement or DeSci for short combines blockchain and Web3 technologies to improve scientific research.

A primary goal of DeSci is wider participation and funding when approaching scientific challenges as well as democratizing the peer-to-peer review process which is dominated by a few journals in which it can be costly to appear and combatting censorship. DeSci can also create standards for research storage with the proof of existence technology. Whereas on financial blockchains such as Bitcoin transactions are verified by a network of miners research could also be verified by participants in a blockchain network of scientists etc.

Decentralization of science

Blockchain-based peer review ecosystems can be transparent and they can lend credibility to research contributed by even pseudonymous participants. Scientists might for instance receive a stake or “reward” for participating incentivizing a wider community to contribute.

Essentially decentralized science makes possible the development of platforms that empower more people to work with what Dr. Benjamin Bratton calls the “source code of matter” at a fundamental level. To democratize science through decentralized science would allow for a new kind of interface layer for a modern Scientific Revolution. The way to do this is to decentralize access to scientific pursuits — in short to allow citizen-scientists a role.

We saw this happen with computers and we believe it could happen with science generally. At the beginning of the computer revolution software was difficult to work with. Very few understood the rarified technologies which over time became increasingly intuitive and simplified — thanks to different levels of abstraction — and therefore allowed more people to become valuable contributors. Some of the technologies that made this possible include Javascript and helpful packages developed to make coding more efficient. At a lower level of abstraction there is a technology like WordPress that allows people who don't understand software or coding to set up their website.

Blockchain tech for science

Blockchain technology (tokens NFTs metaverses) has the potential to positively impact platform economics in such a way that democratizes access to scientific collaborations. When you think of platforms you generally think of Uber or Airbnb which are world-changing projects in and of themselves. But the economics of platforms is something that is a very new field of research and is indeed even pushing game theory as an academic discipline forward. This process began with Bitcoin (BTC) and has only been furthered by Ethereum (ETH) and the dozens if not hundreds of other blockchains since.

Related: Which blockchain is the most decentralized? Experts answer

Historically web platforms and apps have tended to be centripetal in their process of value creation; the more they are used the more value the platform builder realizes. Blockchain makes possible a more equitable arrangement whereby the more people who participate in any given platform and the more people adding value to the platform the more they are getting back from the platform.

Decentralized science (DeSci) is different from an IP platform or a platform in which the more it is used the more the platform benefits and the value consolidates. In the case of DeSci the people who generate the value — the researchers the scientists citizen scientists etc. — gain value in line with the value of their contribution; i.e. the more it is used by other researchers and scientists etc. the more value they receive.

The impact that this can have on basic research in science and math and other kinds of things could be enormously important. DeSci is creating new ways of contributing and collaborating which were not possible until blockchain technology came along. If you have knowledge or understanding that is valuable intrinsically and as a component of a larger project (you might not even know what that project is) someone else may make use of your contribution and you can be recognized for it and earn residuals from that contribution on into the future.

NFTs will play a big role in the future of the metaverse for it is through NFTs that scientific research could be securely transferred. Academia has already used NFTs. The University of California Berkeley for instance auctioned off an NFT pegged to documents relating to the world of Nobel-prizewinning cancer researcher James Allison for more than $50000. The U.S. Space Force a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces began selling a series of NFTs featuring augmented-reality images of satellites and space iconography. Biology pioneer George Church’s company Nebula Genomics plans to sell an NFT of Church’s genome. Church is a geneticist at Harvard University in Cambridge and helped launch the Human Genome Project. There are burgeoning use cases for NFTs in science and surely there will be more.

Blockchain is a high resolution of sensing indexing and calculating value. The potential is there and now it is up to DeSci organizations to prove their merits scientific quality and overall effectiveness at improving the scientific process.

FIFA World Cup 2022 | New Delhi: Doha has revealed the official mascot for FIFA World Cup 2022. The mascot La’eeb is playful adventurous and curious and can be seen wearing the Qatari national dress. The mascot seems to be trying to stop a football in the air in the illustration released by FIFA and the tournament organising body the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy.

La’eeb is an Arabic word meaning super-skilled player. He belongs to a parallel mascot verse that is indescribable — everyone is invited to interpret what it looks like. La’eeb encourages everyone to believe in themselves as ‘Now is All’ the Supreme Committee said in a press statement. He will bring the joy of football to everyone added the statement.

The adventurous fun and curious La’eeb was unveiled during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 draw which took place in Doha.

Khalid Ali Al Mawlawi Deputy Director-General Marketing Communications and Tournament Experience Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy said “We are delighted to unveil La’eeb as the Official Mascot for the first FIFA World Cup in the Middle East and the Arab world. He comes from the mascot verse — a place that is indescribable. We encourage everyone to imagine what it looks like.

“We are sure fans everywhere will love this fun and playful character. La’eeb will play a vital role as we engage fans young and old in Qatar’s FIFA World Cup experience” added Al Mawlawi.

The donations were part of the Sajida Foundation's Hospital Assistance Programme to provide equipment and medical expertise to four government hospitals in border districts and Covid-19 hotspots.

Bangladesh has reported 1.9 million infections and more than 29000 coronavirus-related deaths since the pandemic began in 2020. However its daily infection rate has eased sharply from a peak in July last year when areas bordering India saw a surge in Delta variant infections overwhelming hospitals. (Reuters tracking data - https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/bangladesh/)

In response to the July-October surge in cases the Hospital Assistance Programme installed a total of 32 intensive care units (ICUs) and 34 moderate-care high dependency units (HDUs) in three hospitals at Jashore Meherpur and Chuadanga while the hospital at Pabna received additional general beds for COVID patients.

Under the programme the Foundation procured PPE (personal protective equipment) masks sanitizers and assisted with the installation of the ICUs and HDUs. It also provided training for staff hired on an ad-hoc basis to work in the ICUs and HDUs.

""We provided critical equipment and training to the hospital staff and the ICUs and HDUs will continue to be used to treat both Covid and non-Covid patients in the future"" Dr. Tariqul Islam Director of Health at the Sajida Foundation said on its website - https://sajidafoundation.org/sajida-foundations-covid-hospital-assistance-program/

The foundation said 5705 people were served by the Hospital Assistance Programme about two per cent of the country's total Covid-related hospitalisations and most of those patients (4375) were treated at the 250-bed General Hospital in Jashore.

The Hospital Assistance Programme was part of the Foundation's Tk. 220 million (US$25.6 million) in Covid-related measures for Bangladesh that was funded by donations from the MetLife Foundation the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation local corporate and individual donors.

The facilities and infrastructure provided under the assistance programme were formally handed over to the four hospitals and the Department of Health at the end of September last year for treating Covid and non-Covid patients.

Since then hospital officials say they have struggled to make optimal use of the units and donated equipment.

Dr. Md. Akhtaruzzaman Superintendent of the General Hospital in Jeshore where 11 ICUs and 20 HDUs were installed said the hospital has not been able to hire additional staff to operate the new medical equipment.

He said the hiring process for state hospitals can take up to two years and government does not approve the filling of all job vacancies at the same time.

The 250-bed Jeshore hospital has a total nursing staff of 174 and there have been no new recruitments she said. Ms Hasina a senior nurse at the Jeshore General Hospital said they can deploy 7 nurses to work in the ICUs and HDUs compared to the required 15 nurses to make the best use of the facilities. The 250-bed hospital has a total nursing staff of 174 and there have been no new recruitments she said.

""Proper care is not possible with such a poor number of nurses"" she told the FE.

The 250-bed General Hospital in Meherpur a border administrative unit in Bangladesh has also struggled to hire skilled staff to operate the donated equipment.

As a result senior specialized nurses have been assigned to work in the hospital's 06 ICUs and 08 HDUs. That has stretched nursing resources at a time when the hospital only has 170 nurses enough to staff a 100-bed hospital.

In the district of Pabna the main hospital's unstable power supply meant it could not receive an ICU or HDU but the Foundation was able to provide 100 general beds for Covid patients.

In Chuadanga another border district more than 300 kms from the capital Dhaka the 250-bed General Hospital received 05 ICUs and 06 HDUs but did not have the skilled staff to operate them fully.

Dr. Md. Maruf a former superintendent of the hospital said they did not receive support from the central government.

""During my tenure we had applied to Dhaka but ultimately we are yet to get any manpower"" he said.

The hospital would like to use the ICUs and HDUs for non-covid patients but he asked: ""Who will operate it?""

Dr. Md. Farid Hossain Miah -- Director (Hospital) of the directorate General of Health and Services the government agency that implements health programmes in Bangladesh -- told the FE that he was familiar with the equipment and services provided by the Sajida Foundation. ""They have donated us all equipment"" he said.

But he said they have yet to hire additional staff to operate and maintain the donated medical devices. ""We're trying to hire manpower for all hospitals of the country through a number of projects"" Miah said.

In an interview with FE Sajida's Dr. Tariqul Islam said the Foundation does not have the power to dictate to state-run hospitals how to make best use of the equipment and units donated under the Hospital Assistance Programme.

He said the programme hired 209 frontline workers [doctors nurses and other related people] under two-month contracts to operate the facilities at the government hospitals.

Sajida later retained 7 of the contract workers for the Foundation's own hospital but Islam acknowledged the government recruiting process is too complex and state hospitals cannot easily recruit the contractors.

The government's hiring process is usually long and centralized with job vacancies are advertised in newspapers and candidates required to take competitive exams.

The government has recruited 400 anesthesiologists and 8000 nurses in the country over the past two years to strengthen the delivery of health services but no vacancies were advertised in the four districts hard hit by COVID-19.

""Actually the ministry had posted them ….. they choose the hospitals …"" Dr. Farid Miah told the FE.

Situated on stand A40 in Hall 7 at the Fiera Milano in Milan Italy the Mettler-Toledo Product Inspection booth will feature the first showing of the next-generation M34R metal detection system. Visitors will also see a preview of a brand new affordable x-ray inspection system that will be launched in Europe later this year. The list of technologies that will be on display at the booth includes –

Mettler-Toledo M34R PlusLine metal detection system incorporating GC conveyor

Launched in September 2021 the M34R is part of a new family of modular smart metal detection systems known as the M30 R-Series. Designed specifically for small and medium-sized manufacturers and co-packers the metal detection systems are powered by new ‘Sense’ smart software. The software combined with advanced algorithms makes it possible for the entry-level models to deliver high sensitivity to all metal contaminant types with minimal false rejects. The M34R PlusLine is especially tailored to ‘wet’ challenging and conductive applications using advanced signal suppression technology to reduce false reject rates.

Mettler-Toledo AdvancedLine CX3570 Checkweigher/X-ray combination system

Precision weighing contaminant detection and quality control checks at line speeds of up to 500ppm the CX3570 is a compact weighing and inspection system able to accommodate packs up to 10kg in weight.

Mettler-Toledo Throat 200 Metal Detector with ATS

Used for inspecting free-falling products the Throat 200 is designed for VFFS applications incorporating multiple ultra-high tuned frequencies with enhanced noise and vibration immunity helping to maximize sensitivity and detection performance. Automatic Test System (ATS) undertakes a number of optimised metal detection tests (detecting ferrous non-ferrous stainless steel and aluminium) ensuring repeatability and centre-line performance.

As yet unannounced X-ray inspection system

Brand new affordable x-ray innovation bringing the advantages of x-ray inspection to all production lines in Europe. Previously known as a high-end solution this brand new solution makes x-ray inspection accessible for all food manufacturers and enables food safety by combining high detection sensitivity and enhanced detection capabilities with advances in ease of operation safety maintenance and servicing.

“We’re excited to be getting back out there and meeting our customers again” said Roberto Scanu Business Area manager at Mettler-Toledo Product Inspection. “The Ipack-Ima event represents a great opportunity for visitors to see our latest inspection systems for the food and packaging sectors including some truly unique and exciting breakthrough technologies. The market wants smart solutions to its challenges and that’s what people will discover when they stop by our booth in Milan in May.”

A debilitating and still-mysterious illness kept him largely out of his Bokke blendery and often in the hospital. Now he must live with the condition without knowing if or when it will strike again. Yet he is back in his blendery working upbeat with a refreshed outlook and plenty of ideas for what he wants to do with his life and his beer.

In this episode of the podcast he discusses:

the challenge of running a small-scale palate-dependent blendery when also facing difficult personal health issues

rethinking the blendery’s production processes by investing in equipment to reduce manual labor wherever that labor doesn’t improve the beer

working less but at higher quality

searching for and developing local sources of heirloom fruit varieties that create better flavor in fruit beers

timing fruit-picking to maximize ripeness at the expense of flexibility

using underappreciated parts of the fruit such as skin pits and leaves that make valuable flavor contributions

refermentation strategies for limiting oxidation and maximizing flavor in fruit beers

thinking about lambic and gueuze as “low-intervention” more than “natural” beers

aging and blending strategies to improve texture and mouthfeel

And more.

“Making a product that’s different—everyone can do that” Souvereyns says. “Everyone can piss in a bottle. But making a product that’s different and also very tasty—not just unique but also something new and refreshing—that’s something different. That’s what I’m aiming for of course.”

LAS VEGAS — When tickets for K-pop sensation BTS' four April concerts at Allegiant Stadium went up for presale every seat sold in less than two hours — a testament to the boy band's tremendous popularity.

It also marked the latest success for the programming of concerts and special events at the 65000-seat venue where performances are outperforming projections made prior to its $1.9 billion construction quieting naysayers who doubted that a $750 million public investment was a good idea.

""I took a fair amount of criticism at the point when I was doing the economic and fiscal impact analysis of Allegiant Stadium"" Jeremy Aguero formerly a principal with Las Vegas-based Applied Analysis told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He is now chief operations and analytics officer for the Las Vegas Raiders.

When Aguero was advising the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee and later the Las Vegas Stadium Authority officials cautiously suggested that financial needs could be met if the stadium could host around 46 events a year including the NFL's Las Vegas Raiders and UNLV college football games.



ROOM-TAX PROJECTIONS

That made assumptions that hotel occupancy rates and the average daily room rate from which a 0.88% room tax would be collected would remain stable.

Even though the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on occupancy and room rates the successes of Allegiant Stadium event programming have been undeniable.

""Here I now am five years on the other side of that and I think we are exceeding by a wide margin at least at the outset every estimate we had. It's just incredible to be a part of"" Aguero said.

The earliest room-tax revenue projections suggested that bonds could be paid off and a waterfall fund to pay for other expenses could be built if between $4 million and $5 million in room taxes were collected every month.

In the early days of the tax generating $4 million a month was relatively easy.

But two years ago when hotels and their casinos were shut down by COVID-19 restrictions tax collections collapsed and Clark County had to dig into a reserve fund to pay off bonds.

It wasn't until July 2021 — the second full month after resorts fully reopened — that room-tax collections began surpassing the $4 million level.

In the last six months of 2021 room tax collections averaged $4.1 million a month a sign that visitation was on the road to recovery.



PROJECTING 46 EVENTS

Steve Hill who worked with Aguero as chairman of the Infrastructure Committee and the Las Vegas Stadium Authority and is president and CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said projecting 46 events was a conservative play.

""We thought those 46 events would draw 1.9 million people"" Hill said. ""We're well ahead of that pace and the number of people who are coming to Las Vegas because of the events in the stadium looks like it's going to turn out to be at least twice what we had expected when we modeled the stadium five years ago.

""I would have expected it to outperform our projections"" he said. ""We said then that we thought we were relatively conservative but we didn't think we'd be at 45% of what actually happened that's for sure.""

Much of Allegiant Stadium's entertainment programming successes have come from solid bookings of talent capable of filling large numbers of seats.

Booking country star Garth Brooks for the first major concert at Allegiant was a no-brainer. So was landing The Rolling Stones for a sold-out show in November. More recently the stadium scored again by bringing in Metallica and piano man Billy Joel — on consecutive nights in February.

But possibly the biggest coup was programming two groups to multiple nights in the venue BTS for four nights in April and Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny for two nights in September.

""I'd heard of them"" Hill ventured about BTS which is bringing its ""Permission to Dance on Stage"" tour to Allegiant April 8 9 15 and 16.



BTS SELL-OUT

BTS sold out all four shows in presales within an hour and a half.

""They've been kind of a sensation in Korea and then they broke out of Korea and have become an international big deal"" Hill said. ""It's not that I've got all the music from all the groups that are going to be at the stadium on my playlist but yes we had heard of them.

""They've been a big hit for the past couple of years. I would not have expected them to be able to come to the stadium four nights and sell out four nights. That's quite an accomplishment for any music group no matter who they are and how popular famous or what they've accomplished in their careers. If you can sell out four nights that is remarkable.""

Aguero said 86% of the people who have attended an event at Allegiant Stadium have said they would not have come to Las Vegas without the event they attended.

""We've had more than 1 million people come to an event at Allegiant Stadium"" he said. ""That includes someone from every state in the United States and 91 separate countries of origin. And that's just since July.""

Stadium programming is under Allegiant Stadium General Manager Chris Wright who made the move from Oakland Coliseum and Oracle Arena in 2019. Wright credits his team and the attributes of Las Vegas for some of the stadium's early successes.

""It's an amazing city with so many entertainment options"" Wright said of Las Vegas. ""It's a great destination with a large home market that supports the events but then you have the additional attraction of people coming to Las Vegas as a destination for what's playing here.""



HOME TO RAIDER NATION

Wright maintains a solid relationship with the Raiders and acknowledges that the team reaches out to its fans Raider Nation for support in filling the building for concerts in addition to the team's home games.

He said his strategy has been to stay in contact with agents of performers doing stadium tours and to negotiate dates with them as they move from city to city.

Wright said it helps that most performers enjoy making a stop in Las Vegas and that the reputation of Allegiant Stadium as a venue with relatively easy staging access has grown.

Stadium designers knowing that Allegiant would be a concert venue in addition to a football stadium built widened access points within the interior of the building to make it easier for big rigs to drive in and unload to build a stage for a concert stop.

""Artists want to come here"" Wright said.

The stadium also has valuable partners in sports tourism and resorts he said.

""Look at LVCVA for example. They're looking for destination events whether it be soccer or rugby or whatever it would be. They're just a great partner to help market events"" Wright said. ""The casino properties are great partners as well. They help us market events and attract things to come to Las Vegas.

""When it's on a scale that fits the stadium it just fits perfectly. There are so many artists out there today that are looking at stadium dates in '22. Having all those great partners means that we leverage and maximize the share of those events that we get.""



NOT VIEWED AS COMPETITION

Resort properties are eager to collaborate because they see an uptick in hotel bookings and casino play whenever a special event is booked in town and it doesn't matter if the event isn't at their own performance venues.

Alan Feldman a distinguished fellow at UNLV's International Gaming Institute and a former executive with MGM Resorts International said Allegiant Stadium as a performance venue isn't regarded as competition because the scale isn't anywhere close to various arenas around the city.

""That was probably the one missing piece of the entertainment profile in Las Vegas"" Feldman said of the addition of Allegiant. ""It was a major talking point that was at the time when we were talking to community leaders state legislators and county commissioners about the need for this.

""We had arenas we had the Thomas & Mack we had the Orleans we had the MGM Grand (Garden). This was all before T-Mobile (Arena)"" Feldman said. ""We already knew what the booking pressure was on those kinds of arenas but up to that point we were really out of the running for major concerts unless we wanted to just bite the bullet and pay the price to get a Rolling Stones concert to come inside the MGM Grand. We only had 18000 seats but they were going to need 60000-70000-seat stadiums.""

With the addition of Allegiant Stadium to the Las Vegas landscape multiple events can occur over the same weekend he said.



'TURBOCHARGING' WEEKENDS

""That actually works out better overall for the community for two reasons"" Feldman said. ""It marks a huge event over the weekend. You can create a whole weekend around a single event at Allegiant. It also frees up time in those other arenas. So just as you may have Billy Joel at Allegiant you can have a (Vegas Golden) Knights game at T-Mobile. You begin to get this multiple layer of programming and from a community point of view that's like turbocharging what goes on here.""

Feldman said he wasn't surprised with BTS selling out quickly but he noted the fan base for the group may not be quite as favorable to casino resorts because the BTS fan base skews younger than the legal gambling age in Nevada. But because it's at Allegiant and not a property arena it works out well.

Hoops Promoter Brooks Downing Has A Thought On That,"By Alan Snel of LVSportsBiz.com

LVSportsBiz.com reached out Friday to Brooks Downing to discuss the proposed $3 billion entertainment district/arena proposal for Las Vegas Boulevard and Blue Diamond Road south of the Strip. Downing is a college basketball and sports promoter who arranged events like the massive Duke vs Gonzaga college hoops game at T-Mobile Arena in November and the Big West Conference basketball tournament at the new Dollar Loan Center arena in Henderson last month. He has a good handle on the Las Vegas market and made these observations.

On the proposed $1 billion 20000-seat arena have an NBA as a tenant: Downing of bd Global thought the venue will need to have an NBA team as an anchor for the arena to be financially viable especially when it will competing for live music programming against T-Mobile Arena and the MSG Sphere a music-only 17500-seat venue behind the Venetian that is scheduled to open in the second half of 2023.

On MGM Resorts International’s interest on getting an NBA team for its T-Mobile Arena which is also owned by co-partners Anschutz Entertainment Group and Golden Knights owner Bill Foley (who owns 15 percent with MGM Resorts with AEG splitting the remaining 85 percent): While MGM Resorts has pushed in the past for an NBA team to play in T-Mobile Arena Downing thought that interest now might not be as intense as it was in past years.

Downing noted it’s common for NBA and NHL teams to share the same arena like in cities such as Los Angeles Philadelphia Detroit New York Denver and Boston. But it’s always easier for event scheduling when there’s only one major sports league tenant in the arena instead of two. For example Downing said he had to work with T-Mobile Arena on the scheduling of the Duke vs Gonzaga game last year. The announced attendance for that college basketball game at T-Mobile Arena was 20389.

On more arena space for college basketball tourneys in March: Downing said Las Vegas which already hosts five college hoops tournaments every March might even need more space for all the college basketball action so this proposed arena might just come in handy for that.

On the uniqueness of UNLV’s Thomas & Mack Center: While this arena may not host big concerts like it used to there are few university arenas capable of accommodating 17000 fans a night for National Finals Rodeo performances over 10 days and the animals like bulls and horses that hang out on the UNLV campus grounds. It’s a very unique arena for a college campus Downing said. And it is also home of the annual NBA Summer League.

Tim Leiweke’s Oak View Group proposed the arena/entertainment district/hotel project this week and aims to break ground in 2023. Leiweke’s group rebuilt old Key Arena into the NHL Seattle Kraken’s new hockey arena and is a partner in the NHL Islanders’ new arena. Leiweke is also former CEO of AEG the part-owner of T-Mobile Arena just off the Strip.

As I turn I can see which direction north is. These are markers on a compass projected on a little MicroLED display perched on a contact lens held in front of my eye on a stick. After years of trying on smart glasses my return to looking at things through a curved lens the size of my fingernail felt just as wild as ever. I'm still not sure about wearing it in my eyes though.

The Mojo Lens a self-contained display-enabled lens that I previously tried in an earlier iteration before the pandemic at CES 2020 is back in a form that the company says is finally ready for internal testing.

I tested Mojo Vision's latest prototype lens in an office building in midtown Manhattan a few weeks ago as the company was preparing for its next phase of internal development. While Mojo's contact lenses are still not approved for everyday use these lenses are another step down the path and represent the company's completed tech package for what will be included in version 1.0.

Mojo Vision's technology is in a sense augmented reality. But not in the way you might be thinking of. The hard lens' monochrome green display can show text basic graphics and even some illustrations but is designed to function more like a smartwatch. The lens' accelerometer gyro and magnetometer also give it something I didn't get to try before: eye tracking.

The lens' display is the green dot in the middle. That's it. The ring of hardware around the edges are the motion-tracking and other chip components. Richard Peterson/CNET





A world in your eyes

Unlike eye tracking tech in VR and AR glasses which uses cameras to sense eye movement these lenses follow eye movement by actually sitting on your eye. The sensors like on a smartwatch can calculate that movement more accurately than VR or AR glasses can according to Mojo Vision's executives. I didn't actually wear these in my eyes since the lenses aren't cleared for wearing quite yet. I held the lens very close to my eye and moved my head around to see the tracking effect.

When I tried Mojo's lens back in 2020 it was a version that didn't have the onboard motion-tracking tech or any batteries. The new version has a battery array motion tracking and short-range wireless connectivity.

But the lens isn't a standalone device; a custom wireless connection communicates directly with an additional neck-worn device which Mojo calls a relay that will act as the companion computer for the lenses. I didn't get to see that part of the Mojo Vision hardware only the lenses.

The lenses are made to wirelessly connect with a local device keeping motion-tracking and display elements on the lens itself. Richard Peterson/CNET

The lenses won't connect directly with phones right now because the lenses needed a more power-efficient short-range wireless connection. ""Bluetooth LE was too chatty and power hungry"" says Mojo Vision's SVP of Product Steve Sinclair who walked me through the latest demos. ""We had to create our own."" Mojo Vision's wireless connection is in the 5GHz band but Sinclair says the company still has work to do to make sure the wireless connection doesn't receive or cause interference.

""A phone does not have the radio that we require"" Sinclair says. ""It needs to be somewhat near the head because of the transmit power of the lens."" He says the tech could be built into a helmet or even glasses but right now a neckband-type device made the most practical sense.

Mojo's aiming for longer-range connections in the future ideally. The neck-worn processor will be able to connect to phones though. It pulls GPS off phones and uses the phone's modem for connectivity making that neckband a bridge.

How I looked through the lens moving my head around. Not quite the same as wearing one but as close as I can get for now. Richard Peterson/CNET

Navigating a tiny interface

Lifting my head and looking around the room with a lens on a stick in front of my face isn't the same as wearing an eye-tracking display-enabled contact lens. Even after this demo the actual experience of wearing Mojo Vision's lenses in the wild remains an unknown. But even compared to my last Mojo demo in January 2020 getting to see how the interface works on-lens makes the experience feel a lot more real.

In many ways it's reminiscent of a pair of smart glasses called Focals made by North a company Google acquired in 2020. North Focals projected a small LED display in-eye that worked like a tiny readout but didn't have eye tracking. I can see how glancing around the lens can bring up pieces of information very much like a smartwatch on my head or like Google Glass… except different too. The bright display hangs in the air like etched light then vanishes.

I see a ringlike interface something I saw simulated in 2020 on an eye-tracking Vive Pro VR headset when I last visited Mojo Vision in Las Vegas. I can see a small reticle that lands on small app icons around the ring and staying on one for a few seconds opens it up. The ring around the periphery of my vision remains invisible until I look over at the edges where app-like widgets appear.

I see a travel app which simulates looking up plane flight information and a tiny graphic that shows where my seat is. I can glance over at other windows (my Uber ride info my gate). Another app-like widget shows what it would look like to see pop-up fitness data on the display (heart rate lap information like a smartwatch readout). Another widget shows images: I see a tiny baby Yoda (aka Grogu) rendered in shades of green. Also a classic Star Wars shot of Han Solo. These images show that the display looks good enough to view pictures and read text on. Another a teleprompter rolls off text I can read out loud. When I glance away from the apps back to the outer ring the heads-up info disappears again.

It's not easy to figure out how to move exactly right but I'm not even trying these lenses the way they're intended. In my eyes they'd move as my eyes move controlling the interface directly. Outside of my eyes I have to tilt my head up and down. Mojo Vision promises the experience on-eye will make the display feel even more present filling my field of vision. It makes sense since I'm holding the display off my eye a bit. The lens' display is meant to sit right on top of where my pupil would be and its narrow display window lines up with the area that the fovea the most detail-rich part of the center of our vision would be. Glancing back outside the ring is meant to close an app or open up another one.

The next version of the lens is aiming for an iris-like cosmetic design plus prescriptions. Scott Stein/CNET

Next step: Actually wearing it; then prescriptions

The Mojo Vision lens I'm looking at now definitely has more onboard hardware than the 2020 version I previously saw but it's still not all fully activated yet. ""It's got a radio it's got a display it's got three motion sensors it's got a host of batteries built into it and the power management system. It's got all those things in there"" Sinclair tells me. But the power system on the lens has not been activated yet to work in-eye. Instead right now the lens is attached to a small arm bracket I hold while power's delivered to it. For the moment the demo I try is using the wireless chip to pull data on and off the lens for it to display.

The Mojo Lens has a small Arm Cortex M0 processor on the lens itself which handles encrypted data running on and off the lens and power management. The neck band computer will run the applications interpret eye tracking data and update image placement in 10-millisecond loops. While in some ways the graphic data isn't intense (it's a ""300-pixel diameter of content"" says Sinclair) the processor will need to keep updating this data quickly and reliably. If things go out of sync it could get disorienting on an eyeball pretty fast.

The company's timeline for lens prototypes. I tried the 2019 model (on a stick) last time. Mojo Vision

Mojo Vision's CEO Drew Perkins will wear the lens in-eye first. Then the company's other executives will Sinclair says and the rest of their executive team sometime after that. The company's fitness and sports partnerships announced earlier this year are designed to open up some early testing to see how the lenses might work with fitness and sports training applications.

Mojo Vision is also working on having these lenses work as medically approved assistive vision devices but those steps may still be further down the line. ""We could imagine low-vision users having a second higher-resolution camera built into a pair of glasses or hanging over their ear -- they look at something and it takes a really high-resolution picture and then it just appears in their eyes and then they can pan and zoom and see things"" Sinclair says about the future. Mojo Vision's not there yet but testing these eye-tracking wearable microdisplays is going to be the start.

Also these lenses are going to need FDA clearance as contact lenses a process Mojo Vision is working on. They'll also need to be made in various prescriptions and the company aims to shield the chip hardware with an artificial iris to make the lenses seem more normal-looking.

""We have work to do to make it a product. It's not a product"" Sinclair emphasizes about where the Mojo Vision lenses are at. I'd be pretty nervous about being the first person to try in-eye testing of these lenses but why wouldn't I be? This type of tech has never existed before. Only one other company I know of InWith is working on smart contact lenses. I've never seen any demos of how those competing soft lenses will work and those don't seem to have displays yet. The frontier of tiny wearable displays makes previously bleeding-edge smart glasses seem old-fashioned in comparison.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This is an audio transcript of the Tech Tonic podcast US-China Tech Race: Spies & Lies (Part Two)

Nicholas Shenkin

To be honest I mean at cocktail parties with people I don’t know well I usually just say I’m a lawyer who works for the Department of Justice. It’s . . . There’s very little you can say about what we do.

James Kynge

Nick Shenkin works in Silicon Valley. And if that’s where you work well you may have met him. You just wouldn’t know he’s actually an FBI agent.

Nicholas Shenkin

I just bore them by telling them I’m a lawyer who works for the Department of Justice which isn’t false but it’s boring enough that nobody has any follow up questions.

James Kynge

And there’s something else you probably wouldn’t know. The FBI has its own dedicated field office in California’s capital for all things tech. Nick’s job: to prevent industrial espionage and the theft of intellectual property IP theft at America’s biggest tech companies.

Nicholas Shenkin

The best estimates that I’ve seen from private entities put the damage to the US economy from IP theft somewhere between $450 and $850bn per annum. I can tell you that a very very significant percentage of that is coming out of Silicon Valley.

James Kynge

And Nick says that the biggest threat of industrial espionage in Silicon Valley has increasingly come from one place: China.

Nicholas Shenkin

What’s concerning about that is a trend that we’ve seen of more and more aggressive intellectual property acquisition by the Chinese Communist party. They’re targeting biotech nanotech ag tech quantum technologies. If you look at their five-year plan the breadth of the technologies that they intend to acquire is really breathtaking. I mean it is across the board. It is part and parcel of their attempt to build a siege economy in technology

James Kynge

From where Nick is sitting China’s IP theft in Silicon Valley is neither haphazard nor opportunistic. It’s all part of a large-scale espionage mission orchestrated by Beijing.

Nicholas Shenkin

Stealing early technology is the foreign intelligence service’s job. You know that’s what they do. They’re very well resourced. They’re at it every day just as a job. That is just their job. So you know we spend every day trying to stop them.

James Kynge

This is Tech Tonic from the Financial Times with me James Kynge the FT’s global China editor. In this season we’re examining the rise of China as a global tech superpower and its battle with the United States for global tech supremacy because whoever wins will have the upper hand in shaping the technology that will affect all of our lives. In the previous episode we heard how growing anxiety over China’s technological advancements prompted a US campaign to stop Chinese tech espionage and how it led to innocent Chinese scientists and academics being labelled as spies. In this episode we find out about the true scale of China’s efforts to steal US tech secrets and how the growing distrust between the US and China could put the future of scientific exchange at risk.

[MUSIC FADES]

Let’s take you first to a chilly spring day in rural Iowa. It’s 2011. An American field manager is surveying a vast tract of land where he’s supervising the growth of genetically modified corn seeds. He works for a company owned by Monsanto a biotech giant. He stops. He’s noticed something unusual at the edge of one of the fields. An Asian man is crouched down on his knees digging in the soil. Another Asian man looks on as he sits in a nearby car. The field manager approaches them and asks what they’re up to. The two men say they’re working for the University of Iowa and attending a nearby conference. The field manager isn’t entirely convinced [SOUND OF PHONE RINGING] but then his phone rings and as he takes the call [FOOTSTEPS RUNNING AWAY CAR DOOR SLAMS ENGINE STARTS] the two men legged [CAR DRIVING OFF]. In fact so keen are they to get away that they drive straight down through a ditch [CAR CRASH]. Two years later one of the men who had been in that cornfield Mohi Long as well as six other Chinese nationals were accused by US authorities of digging up seeds from Iowa farms with plans to send them back to China. Mo pleaded guilty and prosecutors argued that he specifically targeted fields that grow the parent seeds needed to replicate genetically modified corn. The Chinese government for their part refused to co-operate during the trial. Pocketing corn seeds may not seem very cloak and dagger but then that may be why this case caught US counter-intelligence services somewhat off guard.

Michael Orlando

For us these are cases where they were stealing corn seed. It was hard initially to get your head around ‘Hey why are they stealing corn seed?’

James Kynge

That’s Michael Orlando. We heard from him in the last episode. He’s the acting director of America’s National Counterintelligence and Security Center. He says stealing trade secrets has for decades played a key role in advancing China’s prowess in technology.

Michael Orlando

If you look over the last 20 years the gains they have made I would certainly say there’s probably a number of cases out there that show that espionage has really helped them advance. When you bring together the espionage with the acquisitions and the joint ventures it really gives them a supercharged programme to advance in those technologies.

James Kynge

There are dozens more examples of alleged Chinese corporate espionage to be found in US court filings over the last few years. And some of them go right to the heart of Silicon Valley. Take for example tech giant Apple’s secretive project to build self-driving cars.

[AUDIO OF NEWS REPORT FADING]

. . . a Chinese national working for Apple of stealing trade secrets. Our investigative unit learned that.

James Kynge

Since 2018 two Apple engineers have been accused of stealing details of the project before applying for new jobs at Chinese rivals. Apple investigators say one of them Ji Jong Chen had more than a hundred photos of the inside of Apple’s facility on his phone and a personal hard drive filled with proprietary material. Or there’s the story of a robot called Tappy. The US phone company T-Mobile used it to test new handsets.

[AUDIO OF NEWS REPORT FADING]

T-Mobile had given Huawei employees limited access to Tappy to test Huawei’s phones. Huawei entities directed employees to take photographs take measurements.

James Kynge

China’s Huawei was so taken with Tappy an employee allegedly stole the arm of the robot and smuggled it out in his laptop bag. The challenge for the US intelligence community is the sheer range of tactics that China is employing when it comes to getting its hands on the latest technology. Michael Orlando says some of those tactics like paid up government spies or computer hacking are clearly illegal.

Michael Orlando

So that would be your insider threat individuals who are knowingly stealing information from companies or the government. And then cyber threats cyber intrusions which is stealing information whether of the Chinese intelligence service or criminal hackers who are working on the behalf of the Chinese service.

James Kynge

And then there are methods of gathering tech knowhow that are perfectly legal. Take for example when a Chinese company buys a US company or when a US company does a deal with a Chinese partner.

Michael Orlando

When companies want to do business in China they’re required to have a joint venture. As part of that joint venture they’re required to hand over technology to the government. We’ve also seen a number of acquisitions in which instead of trying to steal our information or our partner they’ll actually just buy out companies. And when you buy out the company you now acquired all the technology and then knowhow that you need.

James Kynge

But the challenge comes with a third approach. Intelligence gathering efforts that skirt the edges of what is legal. In particular what has US authorities worried are China’s numerous so-called talent programmes. Since the 1990s China has spent billions of dollars to attract talented scientists academics and tech workers to Chinese companies and universities. Programmes like the “Thousand Talents” are typically aimed at Chinese nationals working in institutions abroad. If you’re a Chinese tech expert in the US you might be offered a generous salary research grants and even an apartment to return home to in a Chinese city bringing the skills and experience you’ve acquired with you. In many cases they even offer to let participants split their time between China and their job abroad.

Rui Ma

I have encountered such programmes. I mean the city of Tianjin for example told me that if I just establish an office and they were like “it could be a fake office” in their city. But you know I have to invest some money and spend some time there. As long as I can commit to that they can give me a free apartment in Tianjin.

James Kynge

Rui Ma is an American tech investor born in China. We heard from her in the last episode. She says attracting talented people is a huge challenge for companies and universities particularly for smaller Chinese cities.

Rui Ma

There’s a huge talent gap domestically so the “Thousand Talents” might have been directed towards the returnees but in general they’re just like so many of these subsidy programmes talent attraction programmes within the country where especially you have you know it’s almost like the smaller the city the more aggressive they often are with their terms right? Because of you’re Beijing Shanghai you don’t really have to work that hard to attract talent. But if you’re a Xi’an or Shenyang or something then you may have to pay up quite a bit for people to consider moving.

James Kynge

Talent programmes aren’t against the law. Countries all over the world have them. But in the case of China recruiting talent from the US it becomes a problem when those people bring not only their skills and experience but also confidential tech knowhow. Back to Michael Orlando.

Michael Orlando

There’s nothing illegal about a talent acquisition programme where you’re trying to encourage people to come over to China to work but it becomes quasi legal when you start encouraging them to take technology from their employer.

James Kynge

Take Micron Technology the US computer memory chip giant.

[MICRON ADVERTISEMENT]

Micron’s planned investment of over $150bn in manufacturing and R&D combined with sustained government support . . .

Michael Orlando

So if you go back to around 2013 the Chinese state-owned enterprise attempted to buy Micron Technologies. That deal was eventually blocked by US regulators. And then in 2016 or 2017 a number of employees in Micron and a subsidiary of Micron were recruited in a talent acquisition programme to come over to a competitor company and they took technology from Micron and it was being passed to a Chinese company. Talent programmes are where we’re gonna continue to see challenges from China. So the “Thousand Talent” programme is one of I think at least 200 talent acquisition programmes that they have in which they are trying to recruit Americans and others to come to China to work in China and bring the technology with them so that they can build up Chinese companies. I think companies and universities are going to have wider awareness and to try to educate their workforce on these talent programmes so that their employees think carefully before they take these opportunities knowing that these opportunities will support the Chinese Communist party’s agenda which is generally not aligned with US interests.

James Kynge

The US intelligence community’s suspicion is that these talent programmes are effectively spy recruitment networks and it makes the job of combating Chinese corporate espionage all the more difficult. The US’s spy hunters aren’t just looking for hackers and bona fide Chinese spies. They’re looking for anyone who might be encouraged to share trade secrets for the sake of their career.

Michael Orlando

I think in the illegal spectrum the FBI does an excellent job in countering insider threat and the cyber problem. But when you pivot over to those legal techniques the tools that the FBI and others have don’t really match up.

James Kynge

That’s where people like Nick Shenkin the FBI’s man in Silicon Valley come in.

Nicholas Shenkin

When we go out and we interface with these companies it can be surprising to us how little is common knowledge.

James Kynge

Is the response mostly very receptive?

Nicholas Shenkin

It’s usually very receptive yeah. We’re providing them with information that cannot get anywhere else. We can build that relationship to say OK here’s your toolset so that they can get high quality red flags within their organisations. And then as that company is comfortable they can share that information with us and we can continue to share intelligence with them.

James Kynge

Nick will sit down in a Silicon Valley office and teach companies and investors what to watch out for. And then those companies and investors will pass on intel to the FBI about employee involvement in espionage. Is it possible to give an indication of sort of how many Chinese agents there are at any one time in Silicon Valley looking for intellectual property? Is it possible to quantify it in that way?

Nicholas Shenkin

Unfortunately the actual number that we’re aware of is a classified number so I can’t give you that actual figure. Suffice to say the number of present on the ground in any high target area would be very significant. We encourage companies in their insider threat protocols to not look at employees as threats but as potential victims of exploitation. You know don’t look at your employees as a you know potential insider threat. Look at them as a potential victim of foreign intelligence recruiting.

James Kynge

But alerting firms is a fine balancing act. How do you warn companies about IP theft that might be happening within their own ranks without turning every single one of their employees into a perceived potential criminal agent? And what about accusations that sounding such alarms leaves many ethnic Chinese employees particularly vulnerable to suspicion or even unwarranted persecution?

Nicholas Shenkin

To clarify it’s not the Chinese people it’s or people of Chinese descent. This is the Communist Party of China. Their espionage doesn’t really have a lot to do with the Chinese people just to be clear on that.

James Kynge

Nick says this line over and over again but there is a further complexity that does make any Chinese national working in the US a potential security threat in the eyes of the FBI. Chinese nationals have to share information with the Chinese government by law if ordered to do so.

Nicholas Shenkin

Anybody who is subject to the jurisdiction of any person entity or company they must yield all information to which they have access to the CCP on demand. Would they refer to that as a whole of society approach to intelligence gathering? That’s what the Chinese government refers to it as. So whereas in the west we think well we’ve got an NDA we’ve got a proprietary agreement. In fact those clauses are utterly useless against the law of the Communist Party of China. So what ends up happening is a tech company will enter into say a joint venture with a Chinese company or Chinese university or whatever it may be really any entity subject to the Chinese government. We think that we’re dealing with a party who may be perfectly honest and decent as human beings or as whatever entity it may be but they are subject to laws that force them to steal from that US company or that US party or US university.

James Kynge

Logically if you accept this FBI interpretation of Chinese law absolutely every Chinese citizen living in the United States is a potential espionage threat. That’s a bold claim and it goes some way to explain why the FBI has cast its net so very wide. So wide in fact that innocent academics get ensnared like Professor Xi arrested as we heard in episode one his whole life and career turned upside down.

Xiaoxing Xi

The first time when I saw on the indictment the United States of America versus Xiaoxing Xi I mean that was a very (sighs) . . . The feeling was I cannot forget about it. We have to push back. Otherwise for me I think it’s very clear this country is moving towards the direction where there will be zero academic or scientific exchanges with China.

James Kynge

A quick break now. We’ll be back in a moment.

[ADVERTISEMENT]

James Kynge

The scientific community is worried about the impact of US-China tech rivalry on the global exchange of talent and ideas. An end to scientific exchange would be a huge break from the past. For decades the dream of studying in the US has been an obsession for millions of young Chinese looking to advance in life. When I was based in Beijing as a correspondent the FT bureau was close to the American embassy and every day you would see queues snaking around the block queues of Chinese applying for visas to study in the US. That is still the case. But for how much longer?

Wang Huiyao

China now is the largest talent supply country to the United States.

James Kynge

Wang Huiyao is founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing.

Wang Huiyao

That the US is attracting the best talent around the world to the United States. You know US is picking the talent from seven billion people where China is picking talent from 1.3bn so I think that really make a lot of difference in terms of innovation.

James Kynge

But Wang says the hardline stance adopted by the US intelligence community on suspected espionage is discouraging many talented Chinese from seeing the US as a place to build their career.

Wang Huiyao

It is being reported in China and China’s government official has responded to that and suddenly there is a cold war mentality. It’s actually turned off many Chinese students to study in the US. I mean that number is dropping. Used to be there’s a big number increase but now the number is dropping and that they will have less people going to the United States.

James Kynge

And he says another thing: that the perception of China as a technological threat to the US is damaging for both countries preventing them from working together. I think you know everybody is really amazed at the speed that China’s been climbing the technology ladder. And one of the recent statements that really struck me was from Eric Schmidt the former CEO of Google who said China was now in a position to soon overtake the United States in terms of its all round technological power and expertise. Would you agree with that statement?

Wang Huiyao

I would still think that statement is a little bit over overstated. I think US is still the largest economy and the largest innovation country in the world. But China you know has its own advantage of course. I think China can really you know learn technology and that maybe in terms of application can really do well in terms of manufacturing can do well. So I would think US and China can be a best partner if they are really co-operating so then they can really enrich the world and they can really contribute in terms of prosperity and development.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

James Kynge

Co-operation. Best partners. What Wang says there echoes the Chinese government line a government that has repeatedly denied accusations of industrial espionage. It’s a view that’s miles away from the picture painted by Nick Shenkin at the FBI. Remember Shenkin said that IP theft by the Chinese government is . . .

Nicholas Shenkin

Part and parcel of their attempt to build a siege economy in technology.

James Kynge

It’s a quote I took to Winston Ma. We heard from him in the previous episode. He’s a former managing director of China’s sovereign wealth fund and an author of multiple books on China’s technological transformation and he’s been part of that transformation. He studied semiconductor physics with law in Shanghai so that he could forge a career in patents and intellectual property in China. Does he agree with the view that China’s technology boom is built on years of stolen US tech?

Winston Ma

I think there’s some truth to it you know because the Chinese patent and legal system is still so young. But from a US-China tech race perspective right the US should not stay on that aspect because a lot of unique completely original innovation are coming from Chinese innovation system right now.

James Kynge

Winston Ma points to a startling fact: China is innovating on its own and quickly. It was the biggest source of applications for international patents in the world in 2020. A year earlier it had knocked the US off that perch.

Winston Ma

From the US side. Obviously they should defend their own innovation. But as importantly they have to put to their innovation effort together and then compete with China head to head on innovation itself. A few months ago actually very recent China has developed a new government policy another five-year plan calling China to be a patent powerhouse by 2025. So it has the incentive to develop a patent law system to protect innovation.

James Kynge

In fact Winston argues that while IP theft may have been a problem in the past there’s less incentive these days for China to steal tech innovation.

Winston Ma

Now what do we see is the US and the China are at the same starting point in many of the frontier technologies right? In AI in production in cloud in data analytics all these frontier technology areas. US and the China are almost at the same starting point competing direct to each other.

James Kynge

This is all cold comfort though to the legal teams defending dozens of US-based ethnic Chinese academics. Many of them are still facing espionage charges. As we heard in the previous episode Gisela Kusakawa of Asian Americans Advancing Justice has been handling a lot of cases of ethnic Chinese scientists who argue they’ve been wrongly accused.

Gisela Kusakawa

We have always had this looming shadow over our head that we are not American that we are disloyal and that we are prone to some sort of acts of sabotage or economic espionage.

[Audio report]

More than a hundred thousand men women and children all of Japanese ancestry were moved from their homes in the Pacific coast state to wartime communities established in out of the way places.

James Kynge

What makes that suspicion particularly painful is that the United States has form on this front.

[Audio report]

Santa Anita racetrack for example suddenly became a community of about 17000 persons. Behind them they left shops and homes they had occupied for many years

James Kynge

During the second world war after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii the US government confined people of Japanese ancestry to internment camps.

Gisela Kusakawa

At that time our government thought and had presumed that everyone of Japanese ancestry was a national security risk and could commit acts of espionage. That was largely motivated by racial prejudice. And yet we’re seeing that happen here now against Chinese-American scientists and researchers and very much under a very similar template.

James Kynge

Still while Gisela is worried that history may be repeating itself Michael Orlando is worried that when it comes to China’s growing tech power the future might come too soon.

Michael Orlando

My main concern is that time is not on our side and that we really need as a whole of government whole society to get on the same page to recognise the threat and work together. And if we aren’t able to pick up the pace then the Chinese government will outpace us.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

James Kynge

In the next episode of Tech Tonic how the island state of Taiwan the world’s biggest centre for semiconductors has emerged as a key battle front in the US-China tech rivalry.

Dan Wang

I think that Beijing might decide to move on Taiwan but it will move on Taiwan for reasons that would be completely unrelated to semiconductors.

Lauly Li

Really a lot of Taiwanese companies are stuck in the middle and forced to choose side and forced to let go of some of the business.

DRAM memory has become an essential electronic component in keeping our devices running smoothly and fast and there are a lot of RAM options in the market from the latest DDR5 memory to the cheapest DDR3 memory.

However DDR3 seems to be showing its age in the market as the technology initially launched in 2007 turns 15 years old today in 2022. With that context in mind several of the world’s largest DRAM suppliers such as Samsung and SK Hynix have come out to announce that the industry is looking to discontinue the production of DDR3 due to dwindling market demands and higher demands for its DDR4 and DDR5 options instead.

According to Digitimes Samsung has already notified its customers that the company will keep taking orders on DDR3 RAM until the end of 2022 and fulfil these orders by the end of 2023. Popular 1GB 2GB and 4GB DDR3 memory options are expected to have production ceased by the end of 2022.

SK Hynix is also reportedly looking forward to phasing out DDR3 SDRAM production though it is unclear when the company will cease to supply them. The report from Digitimes also notes that citing industry sources DRAM maker Micron on the other hand has no plans to cease production of DDR3 RAM at the time of publishing.

Although most electronic devices of today have already transitioned over DDR4 or DDR5 memory for DRAM there is still a relatively large quantity of inexpensive devices like routers that still use DDR3 memory. In addition older 2nd hand or refurbished early 2010s laptops that are still in circulation in the market still need DDR3 memory for repairs and replacements.



The discontinuation of production could spell a price hike for the inexpensive electronic devices as manufacturers will now be using the more expensive DDR4 option instead and that cost of production in the end would be given back to the consumer. On the bright side technology is finally saying goodbye to the slower DDR3 memory and providing a faster user experience for all by transitioning to DDR4 and DDR5 in the future.

They're talking about you. Screenshot by ZDNet

What do remote employees really want?

Oh what does anyone really want?

More time more money more love and more avenues to happiness.

Technology for all its genius hasn't quite managed to deliver all these things. Especially during the pandemic.

As many employees worked from home they became used to sitting on Microsoft Teams and Zoom calls for hours every day.

It was tiring. There seemed no time for a casual chat. Or better still a deeply-sourced corporate gossip.

You could sit in supposed happy hour events but only one person at a time could talk. And that person was usually talking for at least half the event as their greatest joy lies in hearing their own voice.

I was momentarily rendered insensate therefore when I was assaulted by a new product. Or rather by that new product's PR people.

""You must look at this"" they cried. How could I resist such an elegant entreaty?

It turned out this thing is called Watercoolr. And it emerges from a company called Shindig.

Conveniently there's a YouTube video. It's voiced by the sort of actor who might be more at home voicing an ad for an uncomfortable digestional ailment.

Perhaps though this is appropriate casting. For here we're talking about pain.

""Healthy relationships among coworkers are being strained"" whispers the pained voice. ""Lunch in the conference room quick coffee breaks and visits to your favorite colleague down the hall have all been lost.""

This man could easily voice the Oscars' In Memoriam segment.

He talks about teamwork. While the video shows a group yoga session. Is this how your office used to be?

But let's get to the point of Watercoolr. It's ""a new way to foster community and informal conversation amongst today's virtual workforce.""

""How"" I hear you bawl ""can it do this?""

Well your teams congregate all on one screen. Then they pair off and go into private rooms.

Wait it's not quite like that though I suppose it could be. Instead you click on a coworker's image and then offer them a private conversation. Or join the conversation they're already in. It's like one big party where you can network to your heart's content. Or perhaps not work.

You might think you've heard a version of this before. I did too. But then I heard the delicious part.

Shindig founder and CEO Steve Gottlieb told me: ""Zoom Teams Bluejeans and all the others are built around a single audio channel and a single conversation in which all participate. It is a simple hub and spoke architecture. This works great for 4 6 or 8 participants. not so good for 14 16 18.""

But isn't that why companies have breakout sessions?

Gottlieb explained: ""Breakouts isolated preset private chats are completely different than being in a private chat that is part of shared experience. A breakout doesn't allow you to see all the other things going on in the event or allow you to move easily conversation to conversation or merge groups or bring people into your conversation at will.""

So you can see everyone else who's having a little private gossip? Yes you can. The company says this technology ""allows an array of private conversations to go on concurrently with one able to view but not hear the other conversation groups.""

You can watch their lips move but not hear what they're saying. Oh the possibilities for enlightenment.

Instantly I see people getting lip-reading training. Finally they'll be able to ""hear"" what their coworkers really think of everything. Including perhaps them. You'd be amazed what people say about you behind your back.

I envision people ""hearing"" what someone else has just said about them in another group and immediately trying to join that group to enquire: ""What did you just say about me?""

What a brilliant subversive way of fostering employee engagement and instituting open management.

The latest product updates will go to a new record high number of Business Central cloud customers but Microsoft has stopped sharing the customer count with the outside world for proprietary reasons Microsoft GM Mike Morton told the Directions North America 2022 audience today. But taking away that metric means the company now sees the growth in Business Central as a meaningful corporate data point he said.

Business Central online customer growth is over 60 percent year over year Morton said and user counts are growing even faster as existing customers add BC users and larger organizations choose the product. If he could share the actual customer stats he said partners would see that the product's customer count is ""awesome"" and shows ""amazing growth"". He did not discuss how BC cloud growth breaks down between new customers and those migrating from Microsoft's older on-premises Dynamics ERPs.

The growth in the cloud customer base means that virtually any new BC prospect can now find customers with a similar profile in terms of industry size geography or other angles Morton said.

""Regardless of your industry regardless of your location regardless of the complexity of what you're doing there's probably another company out there running on Business Central in the cloud. It's not just ready for primetime it is primetime"" Morton told partners in the Directions audience.

Other Business Central stats Microsoft shared included:

The number of partners selling Business Central has grown from 1400 in 2019 to over 3800 today

There are now over 2200 add-on solutions for Business Central in Microsoft AppSource up from 450 in 2019. Business Central now has the highest number of solutions in AppSource for any Microsoft product he added.

While there are plenty of third-party options available the Update Catalog website requires just a browser to download updates for Windows.

One problem that users could run into up until now was that they could not download updates anymore in their browsers as Microsoft provided downloads via HTTP links only. Many browsers limit access to HTTP sites and resources. Some allow users to bypass access restrictions others block access to HTTP resources outright.

Even Microsoft's own web browser Edge started to block downloads from the company's Update Catalog website recently because of the use of HTTP. Windows administrators and users had to use different web browsers or tools to download from Microsoft's official updates repository.

When you visit the Microsoft Update Catalog website now you won't run into any resource access issues anymore as Microsoft switched downloads to HTTPS on its website. Files and resources served via HTTP may be manipulated as they are not encrypted. Windows Updates on the other hand are signed digitally and protected against these manipulations.

The company changed the link structure in the process as well from download.windowsupdate.com to catalog.s.download.windowsupdate.com. Interested users may check the download links using the web browser's built in Developer Tools.

The main update page link structure remains only the download links of individual updates changed using the new link structure. Direct links posted on the Internet should be redirected automatically but if that is not the case it requires just the editing of the first part of the link address to get it working again.

Example:

Old Link: http://download.windowsupdate.com/d/msdownload/update/software/updt/2022/03/windows10.0-kb5011563-arm64_b17fbb4bf86fcf66b5971d076ffdb7d570002c4e.msu New Link: https://catalog.s.download.windowsupdate.com/d/msdownload/update/software/updt/2022/03/windows10.0-kb5011563-arm64_b17fbb4bf86fcf66b5971d076ffdb7d570002c4e.msu

Just replace http:// with https://catalog.s. and the download link should work again.

The change improves the accessibility of the Microsoft Update Catalog website as users should not run into secure connection warnings anymore when they try to download updates directly from the resource.

Now You: do you download updates manually from the Update Catalog? (via Deskmodder and Born)

“Digital Transformation has become vital to many enterprise CIOs. It’s all about the adoption of emerging technologies in helping the companies to reimagine their business model and improve their business performance. Be it to generate more revenue or to optimize their operational effectiveness and efficiency in order to stay competitive and sustainable in this fast-changing digital era.” Ted Suen Chief Information Officer MTR Corporation

In this first episode of Business on Air we are delighted to invite Ted Suen CIO of MTR Corporation to share the company’s digital transformation strategy and what it has meant for its 40000 dedicated staff globally. In a world of constant change and disruption the MTR understands that technology is key to its advancement.

As Hong Kong’s key railway operator and one of the International leading railway operations the MTR has always been a technological pioneer. Its innovations stretch from the early use of air conditioning and electricity in trains to the implementation of the Octopus payment system. Innovation is in the company’s DNA.

Learn about how to:

Unleash flexible innovation in a safe environment

Empower employees through virtual communication

Improve customer experience with proactive innovations

In this episode Ted tells us more about MTR’s Digital Workplace Initiative and how it has played an important role in empowering their employees and supporting their corporate digital transformation strategy.

In our podcast interview he shared MTR’s approach to digital transformation:

“If we look at how we start the digital transformation initiatives. Actually we can look into different dimensions. First of all we look into how we can help our employees to have or to run more effective meetings or events by using different emerging technologies. Secondly how we can provide an environment to help us and employees to create a much better innovative environment. Thirdly it’s how we can provide a flexible working environment. Lastly it’s providing a SMART I.T. support environment to our users or even to our customers.”

Challenges usually come with Opportunities

“Whatever changes you make to an organization there are always challenges. People say it could be roadblocks but I don’t think that is roadblocks. Challenges always come with opportunities. So in MTR when we launched the Digital Workplace Initiative back in 2019 it’s a new challenge because you are rolling out something totally different totally new to our organizations. In MTR Hong Kong we’re talking about 18000 to 19000 employees it’s definitely not an easy task to roll out something totally different. But because of the COVID-19 it gave us a golden opportunity to launch the Digital Workplace Initiatives.”

From the start executive leadership and a change program were identified as keys to success:

“In MTR we have a program that engages. First our senior executive executive support is crucial to any major changes to the organizations. Executive will be the role model so when we roll out something new they should be the first group of people to use the new technology to adopt or embrace the changes and be the role model. Second we also have to engage our users and ask them to get involved.

When we implement this at the very beginning we know that we have to have a change program. But Digital Technologies is also a new thing right? So we look at the change program then we think about ‘Are we going to use the traditional change program just like user training forum?’ No that is not the perfect change program so we worked with consultants to implement a new change program which includes like gamification and design thinking workshop because we also need to understand what they really want to use or what they really want to get from the digital initiatives.”

The dosage will be 0.25 millilitres or half of the dosage for adults according to Vietnam news agency VNA citing the Drug Administration of Vietnam.

The amendment to the original approval of the vaccine is based on the request and subsequent data submission from Zuellig Pharma Vietnam which distributes the COVID-19 vaccines in the Asian region it said.

The primary vaccination course is two doses with the interval between the two shots set at

four weeks. Previously the Health Ministry approved Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines (Comirnaty) for use in children aged five to 11.

Vietnam is set to start vaccinating children in the five to 11 age range on the second week of April with the first batch of vaccines (both Pfizer and Moderna’s) slated to be delivered as aid from Australia in the coming days.

As of March 27 the ministry said they received 227.8 million Covid-19 vaccines including over 14 million doses of Moderna all of which were donations from other countries or through COVAX it added.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Children as young as 10 have allegedly been found working in Ghana to harvest cocoa pods to supply Mondelēz International which owns Cadbury. Campaigners say the farmers are being paid less than £2 a day and can’t afford to hire adult workers.

The Channel 4 Dispatches investigation broadcaston Monday comes more than two decades after the chocolate industry pledged to eliminate child labour.

Ayn Riggs founder of Slave Free Chocolate which campaigns against child labour in cocoa farms said: “It’s horrifying to see these children using these long machetes which are sometimes half their height. Chocolate companies promised to clean this up over 20 years ago. They knew they were profiting from child labour and have shirked their promises.”

The Cadbury revelations come as this weekend millions of pounds will be spent on chocolate treats for Easter. More than £300m is spent on Easter eggs and novelties each year including more than 80m boxed eggs. The chocolate market is worth £5.6bn in the UK according to the market research firm Mintel. It includes about 330m Cadbury Creme eggs which are eaten every year.

Mondelēz which made global profits last year of more than £3.3bn has a sustainability programme Cocoa Life. Its logo is marked on its products including Cadbury Dairy Milk and its website states: “No amount of child labour in the cocoa supply chain should be acceptable.”

Under the Cocoa Life programme Mondelēz had by the end of 2020 mapped about 167800 cocoa farms that supply its businesses in Ghana Côte d’Ivoire Indonesia the Dominican Republic and Brazil.

On one of the farms alleged to be supplying Mondelēz two children with machetes were filmed by the documentary team weeding the plantations. Children were also filmed using sharp knives to open cocoa pods and swinging long sticks with blades tied to them to harvest the pods from the cocoa trees. None of the children were wearing protective clothing. The daughter of one farmer claimed to be supplying Mondelēz said she had sliced her foot open while using a long machete.

On one of the smallholdings a niece of the farmer said she thought she was going to her uncle’s farm to help with childcare but claims she was being forced to work long hours on the farm and not allowed to go to school. When asked why she did not speak out she said she was “afraid”.

Under Ghanaian law it is illegal for children under 13 to work on cocoa farms. There is also a ban on anyone under 18 being involved in hazardous labour.

Ghana is the world’s second biggest cocoa producer after Côte d’Ivoire and the crop along with gold is one of its most valuable exports. A cocoa farmer will typically receive 7p from a milk chocolate bar costing £1 in the UK and 11p from a dark chocolate bar.

It means many live in extreme poverty while facing rising costs from the impacts of climate change because of unpredictable weather patterns and changes in crop-threatening pests and diseases. Ninety percent of the world’s cocoa beans are harvested on small family farms with less than two hectares of land.

In 2001 a cocoa industry agreement agreed to eliminate child labour. It was backed by the World Cocoa Foundation a trade group whose members include the world’s biggest cocoa and chocolate companies Nestlé Mars Wrigley and Mondelēz.

But the protocol’s targets were postponed and adjusted in 2005 and 2008. A revised target in 2010 to reduce the worst forms of child labour in the cocoa sector in west Africa by 70% by 2020 has been missed. Campaigners say child labour is still endemic in the chocolate industry.

A study by the social research group NORC at the University of Chicago in 2020 found 1.56 million children were involved in the cocoa industry in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire.

The report found prevalence rate of child labor in cocoa production among agricultural households in cocoa growing areas of Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana increased between 2008/09 and 2018/19. There was a 62 percent increase in cocoa production in the two countries during this period.

Joanna Ewart-James executive director of Freedom United an international organisation campaigning against child labour in the cocoa supply chain said: “Child slavery and child labour have plagued the industry in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana – which produce 60% of the world’s cocoa – for decades. Cocoa farmers are not earning an income that enables them to recruit the labour they need.”

On Friday Freedom United will publish a scorecard rating global chocolate firms on their labour and environmental practices. The campaign group says Mondelēz has invested in community initiatives to combat child labour but along with other leading companies needs to pay farmers more money for its cocoa.

Slave Free Chocolate compiles a list of chocolate companies that use ethically grown chocolate.

Martin Short president of the World Cocoa Foundation said: “Dealing with child labour abuses as a standalone issue will never work until we deal with the root cause of child labour which is farmer poverty.”

Cadbury one of Britain’s most famous companies was controversially taken over by the US food firm Kraft Foods in January 2010. The American food giant changed its name to Mondelēz International in October 2012.

Mondelēz considers a wide range of measures are required to combat child labour. The company has been involved in research which shows that increasing the price of cocoa will not on its own lift many farmers out of poverty because they are farming on small amounts of land.

A Mondelēz International spokesperson said: “We’re deeply concerned by the incidents documented in the Dispatches programme. We explicitly prohibit child labour in our operations and have been working relentlessly to take a stand against this making significant efforts through our Cocoa Life programme to improve the protection of children in the communities where we source cocoa including in Ghana.

“The welfare of the children and families featured is our primary concern and we commit to investigating further so we can provide any support needed. As part of our Cocoa Life programme we have child labour monitoring and remediation systems in place in Ghana which means community members and NGO partners are trained to provide assistance to vulnerable children and once identified we can help to address any cases of child labour.” The company said it had requested additional information from the Dispatches team so it could investigate.

He will replace Glen Walter who has been in the role since October 2017 and is leaving the company to become chief executive officer of the Tropicana Brands Group Chicago.

Mr. Valle was most recently executive vice president of Latin America for Mondelez. In his new role he will be responsible for the company’s $8.3 billion business in the United States and Canada.

“With more than three decades of experience in consumer-packaged goods and a strong track record of success growing brands and categories in the US and beyond Gustavo is an ideal leader to set our North America business on the path for future success” said Dirk Van de Put chairman and CEO. “I’ve worked very closely with Gustavo for many years and have seen his passion for consumers and operational excellence first-hand.”

Mr. Walter takes the helm of the recently formed Tropicana Brands Group which is a joint venture between PAI Partners and PepsiCo Inc. Purchase NY. The JV was formed when PAI completed the acquisition of a majority stake in PepsiCo’s juice business in January for $3.3 billion. PepsiCo retains a 39% stake in the business.

The business includes such beverage brands as Tropicana Naked Kevita Izze and others.

“We are excited to welcome Glen as CEO of Tropicana Brands Group” said Frédéric Stévenin a managing partner at PAI. “He is joining an already exceptional leadership team following a rigorous selection process. Tropicana Brands Group is a great addition to our portfolio as we believe there is strong potential for innovation in the growing fresh natural category and look forward to overseeing this growth alongside PepsiCo.”

PAI Partners is a private equity company that has approximately €15 billion ($17.8 billion) under its control. In 2016 PAI through its R&R ice cream company set up a joint venture with Nestle SA Vevey Switzerland called Froneri. The business combined Nestle and R&R’s ice cream businesses and included Nestle’s European frozen food business (excluding pizza and retail frozen food in Italy) as well as a chilled dairy business in the Philippines and had approximately $2.8 billion in sales.

In 2019 Nestle sold its US ice cream business to Froneri for $4 billion. The transaction made Froneri the second largest ice cream manufacturer in the world according to the company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZHJiLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ldy15b3JrLWp1ZGdlLWRpc21pc3Nlcy1rZWxsb2dncy1mcm9zdGVkLXN0cmF3YmVycnktcG9wLXRhcnRzLWxhd3N1aXQvYXJ0aWNsZV9mMDFkYjdkNC1iMmJhLTExZWMtOWRlNC1iYjllYzVmZmQwNjcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York judge dismisses Kellogg's Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts lawsuit,"You have permission to edit this article.

Some of those substances however could be putting your health at risk.

Now a new study suggests that ingesting artificial sweeteners often found in drinks like soda and energy drinks can leave you in greater danger of getting cancer.

In the study published in late March in the journal PLOS Medicine researchers examined information from a questionnaire about the nutrition and health of more than 100000 French adults. Following up over a median period of about eight years they compared how people's consumption of different artificial sweeteners impacted their risk of various kinds of cancer and of cancer overall.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

""To our knowledge no previous cohort study had directly investigated the associations between quantitative artificial sweetener intakes per se — distinguishing the different types of sweeteners — and cancer risk"" study authors Charlotte Debras and Dr Mathilde Touvier of the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN) at the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) at Sorbonne Paris Nord University tell Eat This Not That!. ""In this large population-based study…artificial sweeteners (especially aspartame and acesulfame-K) which are used in many food and beverage brands worldwide were associated with increased cancer risk.""

Moreover prior studies have linked aspartame with increased blood sugar and inflammation as well as with raising your risk of insulin insensitivity. Acesulfame-K for its part has been previously linked with cancer as well as with glucose intolerance. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) aspartame is found in gum cereal certain beverages and more while acesulfame-K can be found in frozen sweets candy drinks and baked goods.

That being said the study authors noted that this study doesn't tell us for sure that there's a causal relationship. That is the higher chance of getting cancer might not be the direct result of consuming these artificial sweeteners.

""These results need to be replicated in other large-scale cohorts and underlying mechanisms should be clarified by further experimental studies"" Debras and Touvier say. ""Besides they should not be interpreted as [a suggestion] to consume sugar rather than artificial sweeteners! Excessive sugar intake is definitely causing many chronic diseases … and should also be limited.""

Dennis Lynch has long cultivated a reputation of doing things a little bit differently.

The rock-star investor prefers to avoid the office keeps a reading library to expose his colleagues to different ideas and administers personality tests to his team. He was early to get into private markets as a mutual-fund investor putting money into Facebook before it went public.

His approach worked: He tripled his clients' money over a decade from 2010 to 2020 attracting billions in assets. He even closed two funds to new investors a move that's more common for master-of-the-universe hedge-fund managers.

Amid that growing success Lynch increasingly avoided confronting cultural challenges on his Counterpoint Global team Dakin Campbell and Danielle Walker reported. That left lieutenants to yell bully and wield power over their colleagues their article said.

The turn of 2022 has brought a harsh light to Lynch's investment and team-building strategy. Some of his funds were down 40% from January 1 to March 14 and assets across his portfolio have fallen sharply.

Now Lynch is facing what's likely been the biggest challenge of his illustrious career so far.

Here Dakin and Danielle walk us through their takeaways.

What's the biggest thing readers should take away from this story?







Danielle: Cultural issues are often overlooked when a star team or manager is flying high performancewise. If that streak ends any cracks in the foundation can be more difficult for the team to smooth over.

Did you learn anything in your reporting that surprised you?

Dakin: Morgan Stanley has spent years marketing Dennis Lynch as a bookish portfolio manager in charge of something more like a think tank or university group than an investment team. So I was surprised when our sources told us that some of Lynch's top lieutenants were known to bully scream and browbeat colleagues and contacts. It's always astonishing when reality is so different from a carefully crafted image — and this time was no different.

What do you think the plunge in assets and performance will mean for Lynch and his team?

Danielle: As mentioned by an analyst we interviewed investors will only ride out the turbulence for so long — even knowing they are in a volatile fund. Within the company the Counterpoint Global team has historically boasted a rare degree of autonomy at Morgan Stanley by sources' descriptions. As evidenced by long-held concerns about the culture surfacing performance woes have a way of lessening an investment team's halo effect.

When they started their careers between 2008 and 2010 older millennials were beset by the worst recession since the Great Depression. Then two years ago they faced a huge roadblock at a pivotal point in their careers when the economy lurched into another recession at the onset of the pandemic. Now they're in the worst spot in the homebuying market.

Adults ages 32 to 41 were the only group under 50 for which home prices grew faster than incomes last year. The typical home they bought in 2021 got 5% more expensive — while they made only 4.4% more.

I’ll be publishing this every Sunday so in between posts be sure to listen to the Equity podcast and hear Alex Wilhelm Natasha Mascarenhas and me riff on all things startups! And if you want to have this hit your inbox directly once it officially turns into a newsletter on May 1 sign up here.

Fintech M&A hasn’t been as robust as one might expect in recent months. So when Goldman Sachs announced this week it was buying NextCapital — a fintech company that provides automated advice to corporate retirement plan participants — my ears perked up.

NextCapital was a fintech company before fintech became cool. Founded in 2013 (or 2014 depending on the source) the Chicago-based company has raised over $82 million in funding over its lifetime from investors such as FinTech Collective and Oak HC/FT according to Crunchbase.

In a statement Luke Sarsfield co-head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management said: “Employers are looking to provide their employees tailored solutions and customizable advice that can better support individual saving and investing needs to help improve retirement savings outcomes. We believe personalization represents the future of retirement savings and will drive the next wave of innovative retirement solutions.”

The move is an interesting one as the investment giant has for years been strategically scooping up fintech companies. Again according to Crunchbase Goldman Sachs has acquired 27 companies over time. Last September it announced it was acquiring buy now buy later fintech GreenSky for $2.24 billion in an all-stock deal that was a reflection of its continued push into consumer finance. That deal closed last week.

In the case of NextCapital which uses algorithms and automation to allow users to invest in retirement funds Goldman didn’t say how much it was shelling out. But CNBC reported that “the acquisition ranks among the top five asset management deals New York-based Goldman has done according to the Financial Times.”

It’s another example of an incumbent recognizing that it makes more sense to buy a company that has developed technology that it wants rather than building it out itself — a process that would take far longer and require more resources than a simple acquisition would.

Early investor FinTech Collective said it backed NextCapital at a time when robo advisors were just coming to market.

“We felt that the underlying infrastructure supporting the shift from investment product to digital advice was a more durable interesting space to be allocating capital to” the firm said in a recent newsletter.

It also noted that Goldman’s intent to buy NextCapital “follows several moves by multiline incumbents (e.g. Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan) to diversify into steadier income streams and to build out their own stacks in wealth and asset management.”

Over the years Crunchbase data indicates that Goldman has also invested in more than 900 companies and led 343 of those investments. At the height of the dot.com boom in the first quarter of 2000 the bank had invested in a record 53 startups. In Q2 of 2000 that number dipped slightly to 46. And of course by Q3 it had plunged to just 13.

Its investment activity started picking up again starting in late 2018 and the bank backed 30 startups in the fourth quarter of 2019 alone. In Q1 of this year it wrote checks to 17 companies according to Crunchbase data including to a few that TechCrunch has covered including corporate spend startup Ramp tech-enabled homebuilder Homebound and Indian food delivery giant Swiggy.

I for one will be curious to see who else Goldman backs or buys in Q2.

Fast slows its roll

Last week The Information published a piece revealing that Fast which offers a one-click checkout service for online merchants generated just $600000 in revenue in 2021. Its biggest competitor Bolt raised “roughly 50 times that figure” according to The Information.

TechCrunch last reported on Fast in January of 2021 when the startup raised a $102 million Series B financing led by Stripe. Other backers include Index Ventures Susa Ventures and Global Founders Capital. When it tried later in the year to raise a $100 million Series C financing at a valuation of over $1 billion it didn’t find any takers according to the Information.

But wait there’s more. The publication went on to report on April 1 (and no it was not an April Fool’s joke) that Fast was seeking a buyer after its failed fundraise attempt.

Reportedly the startup hired about 400 employees last year and burned through about $10 million a month for most of that period; $600000 divided by 12 = $50000 in revenue a month. Spending $10 million a month when your product is only generating $50000 in the same time frame doesn’t seem smart. As my extremely talented colleague Ingrid Lunden put it: “This is the story for a lot of startups but maybe particularly ironic when it’s a fintech startup built to process and make money…A lot of these payment companies are built precisely on economies of scale. Margins are super thin on the transactions and the tech costs a lot to build and operate which is why growth/reach/size matter.”

Add to this equation a CEO — Domm Holland — who is known for his “brash style” and had his share of controversy in Australia prior to starting Fast. Holland’s former startup Tow.com.au which aimed to be “the Uber of towing” failed in what at least one person described as a “disaster.” In February NPR published an article noting that Holland’s previous venture was embroiled “in a multimillion-dollar billing dispute with the Australian state government over towing and impounding fees that led to the startup’s liquidation in 2018.”

It added that “the way Holland has rewritten and polished his past raises questions about how far the envelope can be pushed before crossing ethical lines.”

Also according to NPR as Ilya Strebulaev a professor of finance who studies the venture capital industry at Stanford University told NPR: “Failure is not a curse. But what’s important is how the failure happened.”

So what’s next for Fast? Will Holland resign? Will Bolt scoop it up? Or will some retailer just buy its technology? Or will it just die a slow death?

TechCrunch reached out to Fast for comment. It had not responded by the time of writing.

Fundings across the globe

Funding activity seemed to pick up some this week although still not as crazy as it felt last year.

Here’s just a trio that I covered:

I got the scoop on Cross River Bank raising $620 million in a round co-led by Andreessen Horowitz — going from “tiny to mighty with a $3B+ valuation and a crypto-first strategy.”

Cross River Bank is not just any bank. The Fort Lee New Jersey-based institution is also a technology infrastructure provider that quietly powers lending and payments for many of the fintechs that top VCs are also backing — a reverse of sorts of the more common fintech-powering-bank dynamic we’re used to. As fintech has exploded in recent years so has Cross River Bank’s business — as well as investor interest.

Founder and CEO Gilles Gade told me the company which powers the likes of Affirm and Coinbase views crypto as front and center of its future efforts. Profitable since 2010 the bank is also ready for an international expansion.

Notably David George general partner of the Growth Fund at Andreessen Horowitz told TechCrunch:

When Coinbase was first starting out and looking for a partner bank many traditional financial institutions had blanket policies that prevented them from participating in crypto. Cross River on the other hand had the foresight to lean into this new frontier and support Coinbase and many other leading crypto companies who are still happy partners to this day.

I also got the exclusive on a trio of Palantir alums who just raised $25 million in a Series B led by Founders Fund for their new finance startup Mosaic. This is interesting because both Palantir and Founders Fund were co-founded by Peter Thiel.

“Mosaic is born out of our experience as CFOs and as domain experts over the past decade” CEO Bijan Moallemi said. “We are trying to create a Strategic Finance category. If you think about the way that CFOs do their work 80% of their time is mostly manual right? It’s pulling down data from disparate systems it’s doing ad hoc Excel formulas it’s often one-off analyses. Only 20% of their time is more strategic making an impact on the business.”

Mosaic wants to flip that ratio on its head.

Meanwhile I also wrote about January which wants to use technology to make debt collection a more humane and efficient process. That company just raised $10 million to keep growing.

“We started off by solving the really really hard problem of how do you collect at scale in a really compliant manner or really compassionate but still really effective manner and that enabled us to solve some of the larger problems in the industry” CEO Jake Cahan told TechCrunch. “We have to stop treating individuals like criminals and start making the system work because debt isn’t going away.”

And here’s more that either my awesome colleagues wrote or that I thought were interesting but just couldn’t get to:

Yonder a U.K.-based fintech founded in 2021 raised £20 million ($26 million) in a round led by Northzone and LocalGlobe to bring its lifestyle credit card to market. The company says its vision is to “rebuild customers’ relationship with credit.” Its three co-founders are Clearscore alumni who have pulled in talent from (Transfer)Wise and Monzo to build out Yonder’s team.

CEO Tim Chong came up with the concept soon after he moved to the U.K. from Australia and attempted to apply for a credit card. Despite having a “solid” credit history back home the best he could qualify for was an Amex with a “child-safe” credit limit and hefty fees. Yonder’s first aim is to solve the problem of access to credit cards for expats and anyone with a thin credit file with a sign-up process and credit suitability evaluation based on transaction history from daily spending habits instead of relying entirely on traditional credit checks which Chong feels are discriminatory.

Payments and infrastructure oh my

From the wonderful and oh-so-talented Christine Hall: Payment cards provider CarbonPay which focuses on sustainability now has a corporate prepaid offering called CarbonPay Business Ctrl. Visa and Stripe are powering the card and businesses can get physical cards lodge cards or virtual cards and pay using ApplePay and GooglePay in the U.S.

Whenever company employees in the U.S. and U.K. use the card their carbon footprint is offset automatically. For example for every £1 or $1.50 spent CarbonPay says it will offset 1 kilogram of carbon dioxide at no extra cost. The company keeps track of carbon footprints through a partnership with sustainability-as-a-service company ecolytiq.

Later this year CarbonPay plans to unveil another business card option and personal card offering

Our own Romain Dillet reported on how ​​Visa surprised the European fintech industry last year when it announced that it would acquire Tink for €1.8 billion ($2.15 billion at the time of the deal). Klarna now wants to compete directly with Tink with a new business unit that has its own brand — Klarna Kosma.

Like Tink Klarna offers an open banking application programming interface (API) with Klarna Kosma. Tink and Klarna are also both headquartered in Stockholm Sweden. There are other open banking API companies such as TrueLayer and Plaid. And it’s been a competitive space as Visa also tried to acquire Plaid but that deal fell through.

With this new strategy Klarna is essentially saying that it’s open for business. If you’re building a financial product and need to interact with bank accounts you have one more option.

Also Fortune reported that payments giant Adyen on March 31 announced that it is moving into providing banking services — making it a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) provider. Alex Wilhelm and I talked about how this is another example of how so many companies are realizing the value of providing infrastructure. In this case Adyen says it is launching a suite of embedded financial products that will allow platforms and marketplaces to create tailored financial experiences for their users including small business owners and individual merchants. As Alex put it: “Stripe did this but now everyone is coming for banking infra I think as a way to drive more enterprise software revenues and get away from consumer incomes.”

Meanwhile fellow fintech enthusiast Ron Shevlin in February summed it up nicely in a recent Forbes piece writing that “the rise of interest in banking as a service is the result of the growing embedded finance trend.”

In other infrastructure news…

Plaid’s CTO detailed to Ron Miller how he grew his engineering team by 17.5x in 4 years.

Cross-border payments platform dLocal is one of the most notable Latin American startups in recent history — the company became Uruguay’s first unicorn in 2020 and went public on the Nasdaq in 2021. DLocal’s founders had first launched AstroPay another digital payments platform that now has over five million users.

Now dLocal and AstroPay co-founder Sergio Fogel has teamed up with AstroPay’s former head of product Gonzalo Strauss to launch another fintech out of Montevideo Uruguay called Datanomik. Datanomik’s goal is to connect financial institutions across LatAm through its B2B open finance API which gathers a company’s banking information on one platform Strauss told TechCrunch as told by Anita Ramaswamy who is starting a crypto-focused podcast with Lucas Matney (exciting!).

As the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues one fintech startup is doing its part to help people being affected by the war.

Igor Khmel is CEO of SaveChain a new neobank for underbanked people globally to open U.S. bank accounts. Khmel tells TechCrunch that while SaveChain is still in its infancy (the company plans to launch its app by July) he wants to use its technology to help Ukrainians now by powering a new fintech-humanitarian initiative called HelpUkrainedirect which provides “Temporary Basic Income” to Ukrainian refugees via direct donations in crypto and USD.

Through its initiative HelpUkraineDirect (HUD) the company says its goal is to provide Ukrainians with direct financial relief leveraging blockchain technology and existing banking and volunteer infrastructure to pioneer a “Temporary Basic Income” (TBI) scheme for refugees via direct donor-to-refugee money distribution. The aim is to provide hard-pressed individuals with $100/month for 3-6 months according to Khmel. Crypto and tax-deductible donations can be made at https://HelpUkraineDirect.org.

Pipe-in hot

HubSpot a $24 billion software company announced a new partnership between HubSpot for Startups and buzzy alternative financing platform Pipe. Under this new partnership HubSpot for Startups customers gain access to $100 million in “fee-free funding” while Pipe customers will receive a 30% discount on HubSpot’s CRM Suite.

In other Pipe news Yas Moaven has been promoted to the role of the company’s chief marketing officer. Previously Yas has worked in what she calls the “trifecta of male dominance:” auto finance and technology. Prior to joining Pipe Yas was one of the first employees at Fair.com the car subscription app. Before Fair Yas worked in marketing and communications for Sotheby’s TrueCar and the LA Tourism Board where she led branding growth marketing communications and capital raising.

This remarkable mosaic floor was originally installed inside an early Christian prayer house in the third century AD and it is the earliest known mosaic to be dedicated to Jesus. The truth about its origin and meaning was revealed by a Greek inscription on the prison mosaic which reads “to God Jesus Christ.”

Unfortunately this valuable and rare historical artifact is located within the walls of Megiddo Prison which was built before the prison mosaic was uncovered by archaeologists during excavations that took place between 2004 and 2008. This has limited the ability of academics to visit the site of the mosaic but a radical solution has been approved that will solve this problem once and for all. Rather than attempting to dig up and move the mosaic which could damage or even destroy it plans have been made to close the current prison and move it to an entirely different location.

The astonishing decision was announced by the Israel Antiquities Authority on March 28. Officials from the Megiddo Regional Council and the Israel Prison Service hope the relocation of the prison can be completed over the summer after which archaeologists and tourists will both be free to visit and investigate the site.

Magnificent Prison Mosaic Revealed Behind the Walls of Megiddo Prison

In 2004 archaeologists affiliated with the Israel Antiquities Authority arrived at the site of Megiddo Prison in northern Israel to begin an exploratory dig on prison grounds. The excavations were ordered by the Israel Prisons Service in anticipation of an upcoming construction project that might endanger hidden archaeological treasures.

The name Megiddo is well-known in Christian tradition. In the New Testament Book of Revelations the foreboding hill known as Mount Megiddo was identified as the future site of Armageddon where an epic battle between good and evil would be fought at the end of time. At present Megiddo is largely unoccupied with only a small kibbutz and the prison located in the area.

When they were dispatched there in 2004 archaeologists weren’t certain if they would find anything of historical value at the remote site. But they were hopeful because they knew that Megiddo (referred to as Tel Megiddo in ancient times) had been one of the earliest occupied settlements in the Middle East having been settled as long ago as 5000 BC.

Once they started digging down the archaeologists soon realized the prison was built over a heavily used ancient site that had been occupied by many cultures over several centuries. They were especially thrilled to discover the mosaic during their excavations which continued until 2008 because of how rich in ruins and artifacts the site turned out to be.

Latin Inscriptions Found on Prison Mosaic

The prison mosaic featured multiple panels or sections decorated with complex arrangements of abstract geometric shapes. Most importantly it included three different inscriptions written in Latin. The inscriptions were found on the north east and west sides of the mosaic floor.

The northern inscription was dedicated to an army officer called Gaianos who apparently contributed in some way to the construction of the floor. The eastern inscription was dedicated to the memory of four women whose names were Frimilia Kiriaka Dorothea and Karasta. A reason for this dedication was not provided.

The western inscription included the dedication to Jesus Christ and also featured acknowledgement of an individual named Akaptos who was described as a “Lover of God who contributed the altar to the God Jesus Christos as a memorial.”

The names of four women were commemorated in the prison mosaic although experts don’t know why. (Dr. Yotam Tepper / Israel Antiquities Authority)

A Treasure Trove of Evidence of Past Occupation

In addition to the mosaic the excavations uncovered a village path with the remains of buildings on both sides. The large building that contained the Christian prayer hall and mosaic floor was located on the northwest side of the path opposite another imposing structure built to the south.

As the dig progressed the Israel Antiquities Authority experts uncovered a treasure trove of evidence of past occupation revealing a site that had been used by a mixture of cultural ethnic and religious populations. Some of the more notable finds at the site include the remains of a Roman-era Jewish village where Jewish and Samaritan residents would have lived side by side. The archaeologists also unearthed the remains of a Roman legion army camp along with ruins from a settlement dating to the Roman-Byzantine period.

The Israeli archaeologists were especially excited to uncover the remains of an early Christian community that had Roman army officers for members. “There was an early Christian community here way before Christianity became the official religion” Dr. Yotam Tepper an Israel Antiquities Authority consultant who participated in the 2004-2208 excavations told the Jerusalem Post.

“Through the excavations we learned about all the connections between Samaritans Jews pagans Christians soldiers and civilians” continued Tepper. “To have neighborhoods of so many different religions and ethnicities in such geographical proximity to each other makes this very special.”

Dr. Tepper emphasized that relations between the various groups would have been cordial and marked by tolerance for diversity. “We see their houses next to each other which points to a good relationship” he said. “Because of the presence of different religions here it is a very interesting place to excavate and learn about the relations between the different religions…it can be a very important contribution to our knowledge.”

The Megiddo Mosaic Set Free

Before the Romans left the site at Megiddo they covered the mosaic with a protective layer of roof tiles and wall plaster. The building was never inhabited again after that guaranteeing that the mosaic would remain well-preserved indefinitely.

Now members of the public will finally be able to see the prison mosaic after it had remained out of sight for hundreds of years (and a few more years after that behind prison walls). Once the prison has been moved and the site officially opened archaeologists will be arriving as well seeking to continue the excavations that have produced so many astonishing ruins and artifacts during the past two decades.

I’ll be publishing this every Sunday so in between posts be sure to listen to the Equity podcast and hear Alex Wilhelm Natasha Mascarenhas and me riff on all things startups! And if you want to have this hit your inbox directly once it officially turns into a newsletter on May 1 sign up here.

Fintech M&A hasn’t been as robust as one might expect in recent months. So when Goldman Sachs announced this week it was buying NextCapital — a fintech company that provides automated advice to corporate retirement plan participants — my ears perked up.

NextCapital was a fintech company before fintech became cool. Founded in 2013 (or 2014 depending on the source) the Chicago-based company has raised over $82 million in funding over its lifetime from investors such as FinTech Collective and Oak HC/FT according to Crunchbase.

In a statement Luke Sarsfield co-head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management said: “Employers are looking to provide their employees tailored solutions and customizable advice that can better support individual saving and investing needs to help improve retirement savings outcomes. We believe personalization represents the future of retirement savings and will drive the next wave of innovative retirement solutions.”

The move is an interesting one as the investment giant has for years been strategically scooping up fintech companies. Again according to Crunchbase Goldman Sachs has acquired 27 companies over time. Last September it announced it was acquiring buy now buy later fintech GreenSky for $2.24 billion in an all-stock deal that was a reflection of its continued push into consumer finance. That deal closed last week.

In the case of NextCapital which uses algorithms and automation to allow users to invest in retirement funds Goldman didn’t say how much it was shelling out. But CNBC reported that “the acquisition ranks among the top five asset management deals New York-based Goldman has done according to the Financial Times.”

It’s another example of an incumbent recognizing that it makes more sense to buy a company that has developed technology that it wants rather than building it out itself — a process that would take far longer and require more resources than a simple acquisition would.

Early investor FinTech Collective said it backed NextCapital at a time when robo advisors were just coming to market.

“We felt that the underlying infrastructure supporting the shift from investment product to digital advice was a more durable interesting space to be allocating capital to” the firm said in a recent newsletter.

It also noted that Goldman’s intent to buy NextCapital “follows several moves by multiline incumbents (e.g. Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan) to diversify into steadier income streams and to build out their own stacks in wealth and asset management.”

Over the years Crunchbase data indicates that Goldman has also invested in more than 900 companies and led 343 of those investments. At the height of the dot.com boom in the first quarter of 2000 the bank had invested in a record 53 startups. In Q2 of 2000 that number dipped slightly to 46. And of course by Q3 it had plunged to just 13.

Its investment activity started picking up again starting in late 2018 and the bank backed 30 startups in the fourth quarter of 2019 alone. In Q1 of this year it wrote checks to 17 companies according to Crunchbase data including to a few that TechCrunch has covered including corporate spend startup Ramp tech-enabled homebuilder Homebound and Indian food delivery giant Swiggy.

I for one will be curious to see who else Goldman backs or buys in Q2.

Fast slows its roll

Last week The Information published a piece revealing that Fast which offers a one-click checkout service for online merchants generated just $600000 in revenue in 2021. Its biggest competitor Bolt raised “roughly 50 times that figure” according to The Information.

TechCrunch last reported on Fast in January of 2021 when the startup raised a $102 million Series B financing led by Stripe. Other backers include Index Ventures Susa Ventures and Global Founders Capital. When it tried later in the year to raise a $100 million Series C financing at a valuation of over $1 billion it didn’t find any takers according to the Information.

But wait there’s more. The publication went on to report on April 1 (and no it was not an April Fool’s joke) that Fast was seeking a buyer after its failed fundraise attempt.

Reportedly the startup hired about 400 employees last year and burned through about $10 million a month for most of that period; $600000 divided by 12 = $50000 in revenue a month. Spending $10 million a month when your product is only generating $50000 in the same time frame doesn’t seem smart. As my extremely talented colleague Ingrid Lunden put it: “This is the story for a lot of startups but maybe particularly ironic when it’s a fintech startup built to process and make money…A lot of these payment companies are built precisely on economies of scale. Margins are super thin on the transactions and the tech costs a lot to build and operate which is why growth/reach/size matter.”

Add to this equation a CEO — Domm Holland — who is known for his “brash style” and had his share of controversy in Australia prior to starting Fast. Holland’s former startup Tow.com.au which aimed to be “the Uber of towing” failed in what at least one person described as a “disaster.” In February NPR published an article noting that Holland’s previous venture was embroiled “in a multimillion-dollar billing dispute with the Australian state government over towing and impounding fees that led to the startup’s liquidation in 2018.”

It added that “the way Holland has rewritten and polished his past raises questions about how far the envelope can be pushed before crossing ethical lines.”

Also according to NPR as Ilya Strebulaev a professor of finance who studies the venture capital industry at Stanford University told NPR: “Failure is not a curse. But what’s important is how the failure happened.”

So what’s next for Fast? Will Holland resign? Will Bolt scoop it up? Or will some retailer just buy its technology? Or will it just die a slow death?

TechCrunch reached out to Fast for comment. It had not responded by the time of writing.

Fundings across the globe

Funding activity seemed to pick up some this week although still not as crazy as it felt last year.

Here’s just a trio that I covered:

I got the scoop on Cross River Bank raising $620 million in a round co-led by Andreessen Horowitz — going from “tiny to mighty with a $3B+ valuation and a crypto-first strategy.”

Cross River Bank is not just any bank. The Fort Lee New Jersey-based institution is also a technology infrastructure provider that quietly powers lending and payments for many of the fintechs that top VCs are also backing — a reverse of sorts of the more common fintech-powering-bank dynamic we’re used to. As fintech has exploded in recent years so has Cross River Bank’s business — as well as investor interest.

Founder and CEO Gilles Gade told me the company which powers the likes of Affirm and Coinbase views crypto as front and center of its future efforts. Profitable since 2010 the bank is also ready for an international expansion.

Notably David George general partner of the Growth Fund at Andreessen Horowitz told TechCrunch:

When Coinbase was first starting out and looking for a partner bank many traditional financial institutions had blanket policies that prevented them from participating in crypto. Cross River on the other hand had the foresight to lean into this new frontier and support Coinbase and many other leading crypto companies who are still happy partners to this day.

I also got the exclusive on a trio of Palantir alums who just raised $25 million in a Series B led by Founders Fund for their new finance startup Mosaic. This is interesting because both Palantir and Founders Fund were co-founded by Peter Thiel.

“Mosaic is born out of our experience as CFOs and as domain experts over the past decade” CEO Bijan Moallemi said. “We are trying to create a Strategic Finance category. If you think about the way that CFOs do their work 80% of their time is mostly manual right? It’s pulling down data from disparate systems it’s doing ad hoc Excel formulas it’s often one-off analyses. Only 20% of their time is more strategic making an impact on the business.”

Mosaic wants to flip that ratio on its head.

Meanwhile I also wrote about January which wants to use technology to make debt collection a more humane and efficient process. That company just raised $10 million to keep growing.

“We started off by solving the really really hard problem of how do you collect at scale in a really compliant manner or really compassionate but still really effective manner and that enabled us to solve some of the larger problems in the industry” CEO Jake Cahan told TechCrunch. “We have to stop treating individuals like criminals and start making the system work because debt isn’t going away.”

And here’s more that either my awesome colleagues wrote or that I thought were interesting but just couldn’t get to:

Yonder a U.K.-based fintech founded in 2021 raised £20 million ($26 million) in a round led by Northzone and LocalGlobe to bring its lifestyle credit card to market. The company says its vision is to “rebuild customers’ relationship with credit.” Its three co-founders are Clearscore alumni who have pulled in talent from (Transfer)Wise and Monzo to build out Yonder’s team.

CEO Tim Chong came up with the concept soon after he moved to the U.K. from Australia and attempted to apply for a credit card. Despite having a “solid” credit history back home the best he could qualify for was an Amex with a “child-safe” credit limit and hefty fees. Yonder’s first aim is to solve the problem of access to credit cards for expats and anyone with a thin credit file with a sign-up process and credit suitability evaluation based on transaction history from daily spending habits instead of relying entirely on traditional credit checks which Chong feels are discriminatory.

Payments and infrastructure oh my

From the wonderful and oh-so-talented Christine Hall: Payment cards provider CarbonPay which focuses on sustainability now has a corporate prepaid offering called CarbonPay Business Ctrl. Visa and Stripe are powering the card and businesses can get physical cards lodge cards or virtual cards and pay using ApplePay and GooglePay in the U.S.

Whenever company employees in the U.S. and U.K. use the card their carbon footprint is offset automatically. For example for every £1 or $1.50 spent CarbonPay says it will offset 1 kilogram of carbon dioxide at no extra cost. The company keeps track of carbon footprints through a partnership with sustainability-as-a-service company ecolytiq.

Later this year CarbonPay plans to unveil another business card option and personal card offering

Our own Romain Dillet reported on how ​​Visa surprised the European fintech industry last year when it announced that it would acquire Tink for €1.8 billion ($2.15 billion at the time of the deal). Klarna now wants to compete directly with Tink with a new business unit that has its own brand — Klarna Kosma.

Like Tink Klarna offers an open banking application programming interface (API) with Klarna Kosma. Tink and Klarna are also both headquartered in Stockholm Sweden. There are other open banking API companies such as TrueLayer and Plaid. And it’s been a competitive space as Visa also tried to acquire Plaid but that deal fell through.

With this new strategy Klarna is essentially saying that it’s open for business. If you’re building a financial product and need to interact with bank accounts you have one more option.

Also Fortune reported that payments giant Adyen on March 31 announced that it is moving into providing banking services — making it a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) provider. Alex Wilhelm and I talked about how this is another example of how so many companies are realizing the value of providing infrastructure. In this case Adyen says it is launching a suite of embedded financial products that will allow platforms and marketplaces to create tailored financial experiences for their users including small business owners and individual merchants. As Alex put it: “Stripe did this but now everyone is coming for banking infra I think as a way to drive more enterprise software revenues and get away from consumer incomes.”

Meanwhile fellow fintech enthusiast Ron Shevlin in February summed it up nicely in a recent Forbes piece writing that “the rise of interest in banking as a service is the result of the growing embedded finance trend.”

In other infrastructure news…

Plaid’s CTO detailed to Ron Miller how he grew his engineering team by 17.5x in 4 years.

Cross-border payments platform dLocal is one of the most notable Latin American startups in recent history — the company became Uruguay’s first unicorn in 2020 and went public on the Nasdaq in 2021. DLocal’s founders had first launched AstroPay another digital payments platform that now has over five million users.

Now dLocal and AstroPay co-founder Sergio Fogel has teamed up with AstroPay’s former head of product Gonzalo Strauss to launch another fintech out of Montevideo Uruguay called Datanomik. Datanomik’s goal is to connect financial institutions across LatAm through its B2B open finance API which gathers a company’s banking information on one platform Strauss told TechCrunch as told by Anita Ramaswamy who is starting a crypto-focused podcast with Lucas Matney (exciting!).

As the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues one fintech startup is doing its part to help people being affected by the war.

Through its initiative HelpUkraineDirect (HUD) the company says its goal is to provide Ukrainians with direct financial relief leveraging blockchain technology and existing banking and volunteer infrastructure to pioneer a “Temporary Basic Income” (TBI) scheme for refugees via direct donor-to-refugee money distribution. The aim is to provide hard-pressed individuals with $100/month for 3-6 months according to Khmel. Crypto and tax-deductible donations can be made at https://HelpUkraineDirect.org.

CHICAGO Ill. — Motorola Solutions (NYSE: MSI) a communications equipment company announces the new Openpath Pro Series Video Intercom Reader (Video Intercom Pro) an access control reader that combines video audio and enterprise call routing into an all-in-one device.

The Video Intercom Pro provides organizations with advanced security to help protect students staff patients and visitors.

“Today many organizations rely on disparate systems for security from video cameras to intercoms and badge readers to connected doorbells creating clutter for operators and confusion for visitors” says James Segil vice president access control at Motorola Solutions. “The Openpath Video Intercom Pro combines all of these capabilities into one device reducing the cost and complexity of access control while elevating the user experience for both visitors and operators.”

With the Video Intercom Pro which uses artificial intelligence and edge-computing operators can use voice recognition to search directory listings or activate common commands like ‘call front desk.’ Related: Dealing with Protestors: Minimizing Conflict While Protecting School Interests

Openpath says the system also enables intelligent call-routing and two-way communication providing a frictionless and secure entry experience.

Additionally the video feeds let security staff receive video calls and alerts in real-time send digital guest passes and unlock doors remotely from a smartphone or tablet.

“We’re seeing a convergence of functions across the physical security space right now with demand shifting away from disparate devices and services in favor of a more blended approach. The Video Intercom Pro emphasizes the notion that simplifying life for users is what this market of opportunity is all about” says Mike Jude research director at IDC a global market intelligence firm.

The Video Intercom Pro is hosted in the Cloud making it highly scalable configurable and easy to update with its remote management capabilities according to the company.

The system is compatible with most existing access control and video security systems and will offer a range of third-party integrations.

But as far as the police forces across the world are concerned such technology has until been an unexplored part of what could be a new-gen arsenal helping them respond to emergency calls faster.The WA Police officers will be the first in the entire world to use CarPlay in their patrol vehicles all in an attempt to arrive at the scene of an incident faster and also get critical information on their way to the destination.The CarPlay support is being provided thanks to a partnership with Apple and Motorola Solutions and it includes not only turn-by-turn navigation powered by Apple Maps but also the support for voice commands via Siri.As users out there know such capabilities are rather common in the CarPlay world but officers are provided with a more straightforward system that allows them to set the destination in Apple Maps based on the incident report received on their mobile devices.The voice control obviously is an essential part of the entire experience as officers can interact with CarPlay and the navigation system on the go as they’re heading to a specific address.Now that CarPlay is stepping into professional use territory let’s just hope Apple no longer ships updates that make the whole thing a huge mess.

MSCI,MSCI,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzAyL3doeS10aGlzLWV0Zi1pcy1teS10b3AtcmVjb21tZW5kYXRpb24tbmV3LWludmVzdG9yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why This ETF Is My Number One Recommendation for New Investors,"It has produced an average annual return of almost 22% since its inception.

There have been record numbers of new investors entering the market in the past two years fueled by a variety of factors not least of which is the greater ease and lower cost of doing so.

According to a recent survey by Investing.com 86% of new investors in 2021 plan to increase their stock holdings in 2022 not scared off by the fact the market has been down sharply since last November.

Not overreacting to market volatility is indeed a good lesson already learned. The market downturn has brought down valuations of many high-quality companies making it a good time to buy. Given the fact most new investors are younger and unafraid to take more risky positions according to the survey there's one exchange-traded fund in particular that jumps out as a great option for new investors -- the Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC 1.60%).

Investing in a broad swath of the IT market

The Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF is not a small fund by any stretch of the imagination with some $6.4 billion in net assets. But it's far less popular than its larger rivals the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund which are each hovering around $50 billion in assets. All three are great funds but let's look at why the Fidelity fund may be the best option for a new investor.

The Fidelity ETF tracks the MSCI USA IMI Information Technology 25/50 Index one of the broadest benchmarks used for technology-sector ETFs. The IMI in the index's name stands for ""investable market index"" which means it draws from the entire universe of IT -- large mid and small-cap names. Then it applies certain limits and screens to ensure diversification. The result is a fund that holds about 367 stocks including software companies information technology firms and technology hardware and equipment companies.

However it does not include three notable names -- Amazon Meta Platforms and Alphabet -- as they are categorized as communication services or retailers. But it does include Apple Microsoft and Nvidia -- its three largest holdings.

Why this ETF stands out for new investors

There are a few primary reasons why this ETF stands out for new investors. It invests in a sector that has produced some of the best long-term returns on the market: technology. If you're a new investor and have a long time horizon for your holdings you can afford to be more aggressive and invest in a sector that may have more short-term volatility (see the current market) but typically produces excellent long-term returns.

This ETF which launched in 2013 has returned 21.9% per year since its inception as of Feb. 28. Over the last five years it has returned 25.5% on an annualized basis. And in the past 12 months as of March 31 it's up 18.2% despite shedding over 9% year to date. Those are very good results among the best in its category comparable to its aforementioned larger brethren.

Another reason to like it compared to other technology-focused ETFs is its broad diversification within the sector which gives it a lower standard deviation -- a measure of performance volatility -- than many of its competitors.

The two other factors are its expenses and its price. The Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF has the lowest expense ratio in its class just 0.08%. That means the investor pays just $0.80 per year for every $1000 invested.

Finally the ETF is currently priced at about $123 per share which is among the lowest in its class. If you're a new investor and don't have a ton of capital to invest you may find this price level more accessible while still enjoying strong performance at a low cost.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5wcm9wZXJ0eWpvdXJuYWwuY29tLmF1LzIwMjIvMDQvMDMvcHJvcGVydHktcmV0dXJucy1kZWZ5LXVuY2VydGFpbnR5LXRvcHMtMjEtOHBjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Property returns defy uncertainty tops 21.8pc,"THE heated industrial and logistics sector continued to drive property income returns throughout 2021 while retail property returns bounced back into...

We can thank higher inflation for that.

Since things like food and household products have gotten so expensive now could be a good time to join a warehouse club. That way you'll get the option to load up on bulk items and potentially slash your grocery bills substantially.

In fact you may be thinking of joining Sam's Club if there's a convenient location near you. Or maybe you recently joined Sam's Club and are hoping to make the most of your membership.

A basic Sam's Club membership costs $45 a year. That gives you access to the chain's discounted inventory plus perks like free curbside pickup and same-day delivery. But you can actually get a lot more for your money -- if you take advantage of these five lesser-known benefits.

1. Discounted gas

If the simple act of filling your car's tank is causing you to run up a series of large credit card tabs you're in good company. These days the cost of gas has soared partly due to general inflation and partly because of the Ukraine conflict. But if you're a Sam's Club member you'll get access to the chain's lower gas prices -- which could really come in handy at a time like this.

2. Free battery testing

If your car's battery suddenly dies on you you could wind up stranded or with a huge hassle on your hands. As a Sam's Club member you're entitled to free battery testing at the chain's tire and battery center which means you can take better care of your vehicle -- and buy yourself some peace of mind.

3. Free flat tire repair

A flat tire can be a huge hassle. But as a Sam's Club member you're entitled to have yours repaired at no cost. Compare that to what a mechanic might charge you and it's a pretty good deal.

4. Discounted gift cards

If you're the type of person who isn't the most creative when it comes to gift giving then you may frequently fall back on gift cards. At Sam's Club you can snag gift cards at a discount so that $100 in gift cards at a popular retailer or restaurant chain might cost you just $80 to purchase. You might even find such good deals you decide to buy gift cards to keep yourself.

5. Lower-cost car rentals

When you're traveling renting a car can be an efficient way to get around. Through Sam's Club you may be eligible for discounts on car rentals so it pays to explore that option and see how much savings you can reap.

There's much to be gained by joining a Sam's Club so if you've been on the fence keep these lesser-known perks in mind. And if you're already a Sam's Club member make sure you're taking full advantage of the benefits you're entitled to -- especially if you own a vehicle and want to save money in the course of maintaining it and filling up its tank.

The week before the Oscar ceremony director David Leitch — in a stroke of unintentional good timing — withdrew as the director of a planned Netflix movie Fast and Loose starring Will Smith. Instead he moved on to Fall Guy starring Ryan Gosling for Universal which is supposed to start production in August.

A source says Netflix was competing with Universal to be the next project for Leitch but Universal pulled ahead. According to sources Netflix put out an urgent call for another director to take over a project featuring the star who was heavily favored to win best actor at the Oscars. But soon after Smith’s attack on Chris Rock on the Oscars stage Netflix quietly moved the project to the back burner.

Fast and Loose was to tell the story of a crime boss who loses his memory after an attack. Piecing together clues he discovers that he has led a double identity as a wealthy kingpin and a broke CIA agent. It appears that Netflix was understandably wary of moving forward. It is unclear whether it will try to make the project with another star and director.

Smith now has Apple+’s slave escape drama Emancipation in postproduction. The streamer had planned a 2022 debut but has not dated its release. Apple declined to comment. Otherwise Bad Boys 4 at Sony had been in active development — Smith received 40 pages of the script prior to the Oscars — but will now pause a source said. A few other projects in preproduction are likely to do the same. Netflix did not respond to requests for comment.

In his April 1 statement resigning from the Academy Smith said “Change takes time and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason.”

Toss these titles — nine movies and one favorite ’90s TV show — into your list before they’re gone. (Dates reflect the final day a title is available.)

‘The Killing of a Sacred Deer’ (April 4)

Although his most recent feature the Oscar-winning “The Favourite” was decidedly more audience friendly the Greek writer and director Yorgos Lanthimos has carved out a niche as one of the more provocative (sometimes mercilessly so) filmmakers of his time. After his first English language film the pitch-black comedy “The Lobster” he reunited with Colin Farrell for this heavy slab of psychological horror about a heart surgeon whose strange friendship with a twisted teenage boy (Barry Keoghan) prompts a series of horrifying events. Lanthimos masterfully creates a feeling of creeping dread and uncomfortable uncertainty much of it thanks to Keoghan who harnesses a truly disturbing screen presence; like Farrell he is in “The Batman” and moviegoers who thought that was a bleak picture may find this one too hard to swallow.

‘The Florida Project’ (April 5)

Sean Baker is one of our most adventurous and emotionally curious filmmakers his work dropping in on highly specific subcultures and scenes without feeling distanced or anthropological. In this 2017 comedy-drama he settles in to “The Magic Castle” a budget motel located near Walt Disney World its clientele a mix of hoodwinked tourists and struggling long-timers like Halley (Bria Vinaite) and her six-year-old daughter Moonee (Brooklynn Prince). Baker carefully situates his contrast of haves and have-nots; Disney World is only a short walk away but the lives enjoyed by its patrons seem impossibly out of reach. Willem Dafoe picked up a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his work as the motel’s good-natured manager.

‘Miss Sloane’ (April 18)

The newly minted Oscar winner Jessica Chastain stars in this political thriller from John Madden (the “Shakespeare in Love” director not the other one) as a tough-as-nails D.C. lobbyist who finds herself in the sights of the powerful gun lobby. Chastain made a specialty of these sturdy sharp women who get the job done — the character is not far removed from her roles in “Zero Dark Thirty” “A Most Violent Year” and “Molly’s Game” — but she finds the shadings and contours that make the character unique while Jonathan Perera’s smart screenplay feels like an authentic peek at how the sausage is made in Washington.

The project has been moved to the streamer’s back burner in the days following the 2022 Oscars ceremony during which Smith walked onstage and slapped Chris Rock after the comedian made a joke about the appearance of Smith’s wife Jada Pinkett Smith.

In the week before the Oscars ceremony director David Leitch reportedly also pulled away from the project electing to move to the Ryan Gosling vehicle “Fall Guy” for Universal. After beginning to search for a new director Netflix has now halted “Fast and Loose” in the days following the Oscars.

It remains uncertain whether Netflix will return to developing “Fast and Loose” and if so whether the streamer would seek a new star for the project. Variety has reached out to Netflix for comment.

The story of “Fast and Loose” would follow a criminal who loses his memory after an attack. After mysteriously waking up in Tijuana the character is forced to discover the clues of his past leading him to learn that he has led two identities — one as a wealthy crime lord the other as an undercover CIA agent.

Popular on Variety

Along with “Fast and Loose” it remains to be seen how many dominoes could fall in the wake of Smith’s outburst at the Oscars. Smith’s Apple TV Plus drama “Emancipation” is currently in post-production and was seen by some as a potential awards contender for the coming year. The thriller stars Smith as an escaped slave in Louisiana who joins the Union Army. The film is scheduled to release in 2022 but Apple has not yet issued an official date.

The news of “Fast and Loose” comes on the heels of Smith resigning from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences on Friday.

NEM,Newmont,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnl1a29uLW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3Mvc2lnbmlmaWNhbnQtY29uY2VybnMtbGVhZC10by1odW1hbi1yaWdodHMtc2VjdGlvbi1pbi15ZXNhYnMtY29mZmVlLWdvbGQtcHJvamVjdC1yZXBvcnQtNzAwMjczMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Significant concerns lead to human rights section in YESAB's Coffee Gold project report,"YESAB acknowledges alleged human rights abuses by Newmont and Gold Corp. outside of Canada

Tory Russell was disappointed but not surprised when she learned that her third revision to her submission on the Coffee Gold Mine project had been rejected for publication by the Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board (YESAB) in March.

Russell describes herself as a concerned Yukoner in her mid-fifties who believes in being informed and contributing to public conversations.

So when she learned the Coffee Gold public comments period was open in January Russell knew she had relevant information and started typing.

That spurred a back-and-forth throughout January between Russell and a YESAB assessment officer. YESAB was struggling to ensure Russell’s comments were not defamatory or libelous. They said they needed time to verify the sources Russell was quoting in her submission and the deadline for the end of January was looming.

Ultimately Russell’s submission was not accepted.

Andrew Reid senior assessment officer at YESAB spoke with the News on March 29. He explained that YESAB’s executive committee considered Russell’s submission very carefully. YESAB’s executive committee decided the submission couldn’t be verified in time after consulting with in-house legal counsel.

Reid said Russell’s submission was “on the edge” of being accepted.

At issue was the inclusion of testimonial statements of people who had lived and worked around the Marlin mine in Guatemala. The mine was owned by Gold Corp the same company that combined with Newmont and is the proponent of the Coffee Gold Project.

YESAB accepted Russell’s quotes about the well-documented and rampant human rights abuses at the Marlin mine but felt they needed time to verify and vet the sources in the book Testimonio: Canadian Mines in the Aftermath of Genocides in Guatemala.

Russell had been hoping that hearing from people in communities impacted by gold mining would foster understanding improve practices and prevent future harms.

The book had been vetted by a prominent defamation lawyer Peter Jacobson prior to publication yet Reid said that YESAB needed to vet the original sources themselves.

Significant concerns

However YESAB realized from the number of submissions they received that there were significant concerns regarding alleged human rights violations especially in relation to Newmont’s activities in Peru. Reid said there were “a number of court cases happening with Newmont around the world.”

For that reason the Coffee Gold screening report includes a section on human rights.

Reid said it was the first time in thousands of screening reports that he recalled such a section. “So while we weren’t able to incorporate this comment [Russell’s] in particular the themes that were there were certainly something that the committee took seriously and did consider in its publication of its [screening] report.”

Other Matters Considered

A section on human rights was added to a broader section “Other Matters Considered.” This section includes sub-headings for Placer Mining Mental Health and Wellbeing and Climate Change.

The human rights section has a subtitled piece “Alleged Violations in Peru” with a footnote that includes “Newmont Peru as a legally autonomous corporate entity from Newmont Goldcorp Canada.”

Though the human rights sections are exactly the same in the earlier screening report and the revised final referral document in February 2022 the introductory section was softened in the latest report.

The proponents’ “alleged human rights violations” became a proponent with “a poor reputation.” The second version adds that the committee assesses projects not proponents and that the committee must assume that a proponent is truthful and honest and will follow the laws.

It’s the project not the proponent

The executive committee attempted to create distance between mining practices in other locations and the Coffee Gold project in Yukon. The first report said the location was different the second cited the socio-political context as different.

Both versions of the report read “Comments submitted suggest the Proponent’s corporate behaviour is forecast by the history of its affiliates in Peru. However the EC does not evaluate a Proponent’s actions in jurisdictions other than Yukon.”

Russell in her interview with the News on March 24 said that Marlin’s operations are relevant to the Yukon project and that it was the similarities that motivated her to write her submission.

“It’s the same operator and the same mining technique” she said both affecting Indigenous communities which rely on the land.

Two worldviews

On March 31 Catherine Coumans of Mining Watch Canada described walking into the corporate enclaves of mining companies — how the rock samples displayed in glass cases shimmer and the photographs of expansive open pits serve as badges of success. In the mining industry accomplishments are measured in ounces of gold mined and shareholder profits.

Russell’s submission says “When Goldcorp operated the San Martin mine in Honduras and the Marlin mine in Guatemala it was one of the three wealthiest gold mining companies in the world.”

Now the combined company Newmont Goldcorp Corporation is the world’s largest gold producer by market value output and reserves.

The proponent of the Coffee Gold project near Dawson City Christian Roland has worked on several of the company’s previous projects. He was previously the Mine General Manager for the San Martin Mine in Honduras Cerro Blanco Project in Guatemala and the Marlin Mine in Guatemala between 2004 and 2018.

Russell’s comments pertained to these same three projects. The devastating consequences to water quality the actions of security personnel the stories of human loss and social upheaval are detailed in chapter three of Testimonio about the Marlin mine. These are the sections YESAB rejected for inclusion in her submission.

Russell’s submission reads “Strict enforcement of the highest social and environmental standards will be the only way to ensure Newmont (merged with Goldcorp) does not rely on and replicate the type of harmful practices that have made Canadian gold mining companies wealthy around the globe.”

Lenore Morris a Whitehorse lawyer was one of many others who submitted their concerns about the track record of Newmont Goldcorp.

“This is not a good corporate citizen” Morris wrote. “History indicates that they will do the bare minimum necessary. We would be reckless not to take that into consideration.”

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The quote is fabricated. There is no record of Ardern making such comments and a spokesperson for her office confirmed she did not.

THE FACTS: Posts sharing the bogus claim that Ardern made the comment about the News Corp founder circulated widely on social media on Saturday and Sunday.

“Asked why New Zealand does not suffer from the rage of older white men like in other western Anglo countries PM Jacinda Adern replied ‘Because we’ve never allowed Rupert Murdoch to set up a media outlet here’” one Twitter user wrote on Saturday in a tweet that has been shared over 37000 times. “The guy has wreaked havoc on civil society in US.”

But the quote is fake. Searches of news archives Google and transcripts from New Zealand Parliament’s House of Representatives show no record of Ardern ever making such remarks.

“We have no recollection of the Prime Minister making this comment and cannot find any source for it” Ardern’s office confirmed in a statement to the AP.

The bogus quote is similar to a real comment made by David Cormack a former director of policy and communications for New Zealand’s Green Party several years ago. Cormack told The Guardian in October 2020: “A huge reason that our politics is not so extremely polarised and so far out there is because we no longer have Murdoch-owned press in New Zealand and it’s never taken a foothold.”

News Corp has owned stakes in New Zealand media companies in the past including television provider Sky and New Zealand Media and Entertainment which owns newspapers radio stations and websites according to a report from the Auckland University of Technology’s research centre for Journalism Media and Democracy.

Ranked higher than new F-35B and C Lighting II Joint Strike Fighters or Joint Light Tactical Vehicles the number one item on the Corps’ FY 2023 unfunded priority list to Congress is $250 million in advanced procurement funding for a new Flight II San Antonio-class amphibious warship. That’s because the Navy doesn’t plan to buy the ship at the top of the Marine Corps’ wish list.

“The funding profile in the President’s budget submission essentially cancels the LPD program following the procurement of LPD-32 in FY23 a program originally planned to procure through LPD-42” Lt. Gen. Karsten Heckl the deputy commandant for combat development and integration told USNI News last week.

After years of working together on naval integration the line item is the latest example of a growing split between the Navy and Marine Corps showing how the services have come to an impasse over the future of the amphibious fleet.

Following the rollout of the Navy’s FY 2023 budget the state of the amphibious force structure is murky. The service’s budget proposal truncates the San Antonio-class LPD-17 Flight II production line and delays the Marine Corps’ new Light Amphibious Warship purchase.

The proposal – already receiving criticism in Congress – is exposing fissures between the two sea services over their visions for amphibious platforms.

There’s a growing divergence between the Navy and Marine Corps specifically about the LAW a smaller amphibious ship that’s key to the Marines’ Force Design 2030 initiative and Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations concept multiple naval observers told USNI News last week.

“There’s this difference of opinion in the philosophy behind the LAW which is why this debate about LPD-17 Flight II” is happening said Hudson Institute senior fellow Bryan Clark.

But with expensive bills like the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program and the Constellation-class frigate the Navy has insisted its budget proposal balances maintaining the force it has with modernizing for the future budget officials said on Monday.

“I think it’s money. I think if the Navy had enough money to fund all its high priority programs – aircraft carriers frigate the Columbia-class submarine and the Virginia-class attack submarines – as well as investing in the amphibious force I think they would do it in a heartbeat” Dakota Wood a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a retired Marine said of the Navy’s proposal regarding the amphibious ships.

While buying smaller amphibious ships has become a priority for the Marine Corps in recent years the service maintains it still also needs larger amphibious ships to complete its missions and meet combatant commanders’ needs.

The Marine Corps’ requirement remains 31 large amphibious ships – 10 big-deck LHAs and 21 LSDs or LPDs – which industry experts say should be constructed on four-year and two-year centers respectively Heckl told USNI News in a Thursday interview.

But the Navy’s plan to end the LPD-17 Flight II line – originally slated to include 13 ships – combined with plans to retire four Whidbey Island-class dock landing ships in the upcoming fiscal year would bring the amphibious inventory down to 25 ships in the next five years Heckl said.

“Amphibious warfare ships are being decommissioned faster than they are procured delivered and eventually available for employment” Heckl told USNI News.

Navy and Marine Corps Divergence

The division between the Navy and Marine Corps extends to Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday’s public comments.

Speaking on stage in February at the WEST 2022 conference in San Diego Calif. Gilday said the Navy needs nine LHAs and 19 or 20 LPDs/LSDs bringing the total number of large amphibious ships to 28 to 29 which is more in line with the 24 to 28 range in the Biden administration’s FY 2022 30-year shipbuilding plan.

“Perhaps 30 or more smaller amphibious ships [are needed] to support Maritime Littoral Regiments” Gilday said at the time referring to ships like LAW.

At the same conference Berger told reporters the amphibious requirements study – currently in its final stages – would likely call for approximately 31 amphibious ships. In the interview last week Heckl maintained that 31 is the “bare minimum” number for large amphibious ships.

Navy deputy assistant secretary for budget Rear Adm. John Gumbleton told reporters last week that LPD-32 would be the last amphibious transport dock the service plans to buy in the San Antonio class.

As evident from the top item on the unfunded list the Marines are against ending the line.

A senior congressional aide told USNI News that ending the LPD-32 line – which has largely been delivering on time and on budget from Ingalls Shipbuilding after problems in the program’s early years – is “short sighted.” Amphibious ships and the four proposed LSD retirements in the FY 2023 budget will likely be a crucial item of discussion as lawmakers draft the National Defense Authorization Act according to the aide.

“It’s going to be a debate on the overall amphib[ious] force structure in Congress this year so we’ll see how it all shines out in the end. But we will be debating the four LSDs and talking about amphib force structure writ large making sure we have the minimum number of ships the Commandant needs” the aide told USNI News.

The aide said lawmakers’ thinking is more in line with the Marine Corps’ vision of LAW as a more affordable ship the service can buy quickly and that Congress would likely push to buy the ship sooner than FY 2025. The Navy and Marine Corps need both intra-theater lift and forcible entry platforms – smaller amphibious ships like LAWs and larger ships like LHAs and LPDs respectively – to operate in the region the aide said.

“If your premise is that you support [these] intra-theater connectors LAW needs to move. And when I say move it needs to move forward” the aide said.

The Navy’s recent request also included LHA-9 – a ship Congress has already authorized and appropriated money for – so the House Armed Services Committee is considering the ship already procured the aide said.

Meanwhile the Navy doesn’t plan to buy the next LHA – LHA-10 – until FY 2031 meaning there would be an eight- or 11-year gap between LHA-9 and LHA-10 depending on the procurement year assigned to LHA-9 Heckl told USNI News. Delaying the ship’s purchase until then would make “maintaining the line completely untenable for industry particularly the supply base that construct[s] amphibious warfare ship components” the deputy commandant said.

As for LAW Heckl said there’s some risk in delaying the program because the Marine Corps has already begun standing up its Marine Littoral Regiments the formation the service converted and reshaped to move around smaller units aboard LAW.

“It’s bad. It’s very bad because at some point as we stand up more and more MLRs it requires more and more LAW to support them. And we’re only going to be able to go so far with leasing or finding other creative solutions with the Navy” he said.

Still the Navy has not formally released a Force Structure Assessment in more than five years making it difficult to understand where the service stands.

“We really don’t know where the administration’s at because we don’t have a Force Structure Assessment out there. This amphib study is one thing but even an amphib study with the lack of overall context about where we’re going at with regards to overall force structure it’s kind of missing the ball with regards to telling Congress about what the military’s requirements are” the senior congressional aide said.

Developing LAW

Since the Commandant became the Marine Corps’ top officer he has put forward proposals to reshape the service arguing it needs to become lighter and more mobile to move Marines around the Pacific in a potential conflict with China.

A crucial part of that vision is the Marine Corps using smaller less expensive amphibious ships to shuttle smaller units of Marines between islands and shorelines where they could set up ad-hoc bases. The LAW which would land Marines directly ashore is one of those smaller ships.

The idea according to the Marine Corps is that the Marines who move between islands and shorelines aboard LAWs could then fire anti-ship missiles increase the risk to the adversaries’ fleet and create chaos in the theater during a potential conflict.

While the Marine Corps has said the landing ships are key to moving its new MLRs around the Pacific the Navy has kept delaying the start of the program.

The first LAW purchase was originally slated for FY 2022 under the Trump administration’s December 2020 shipbuilding plan but delayed to FY 2023 in the Biden administration’s FY 2022 budget. Now the first purchase is scheduled for FY 2025. The current plan is to buy one the first year another in FY 2026 and two in FY 2027.

“The first LAW will not deliver within this FYDP” Heckl told USNI News in a statement. Heckl was referring to the Future Years Defense Program or the Pentagon’s five-year budget outlook.

Pushing the delivery of the first LAW past FY 2027 means the Marine Corps would receive the ship after the so-called “Davidson window” which refers to former U.S. Indo-Pacific Commander Adm. Phil Davidson’s testimony to Congress last March that China could try to take Taiwan in the next six years.

The Marines see LAW as an affordable smaller ship the Navy could purchase quickly for about $150 million per hull. But keeping LAW affordable has become difficult as the Navy evaluates the survivability of a ship that could end up operating in the South China Sea.

“I think they’re not on the same page. I think the Navy essentially wants to truncate the LPD-17 Flight II and use that money to instead by the Light Amphibious Warship with the idea that the Light Amphibious Warship is going to have to be fairly survivable to be viable inside these contested environments which means it will be relatively expensive” Clark told USNI News. “And therefore they need the money from the LPDs to pay for them because if you have a Light Amphibious Warship that costs $300 million – which is something that’s more in the scope of what the Navy’s thinking – then if you want to buy three or four per year that’s essentially an LPD-17.”

“That’s the direction the Navy wants to go. The Marine Corps wants to basically have both. They want to have the LPD-17 Flight IIs and then also buy the LAW because they view the LAW as a much … less survivable ship with the idea that they’re not going to drive it into highly contested environments. It’s intended to support mobility and then if they’re getting shot at they may not actually use it. They might keep it in port” Clark added.

Concerned about the history of the Littoral Combat Ship program the Navy has pushed for more requirements for LAW to make the ship more survivable while the Marine Corps still wants to quickly buy a less expensive amphibious ship Clark said.

“I think the debate is fundamentally [that] the Marine Corps feels they’re willing to take those risks and the Navy isn’t on board because the Navy’s worried about the kind of back-pressure they’re going to get from Congress or [the Office of the Secretary of Defense]” he added.

Mark Cancian a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said it appears the Navy and Marine Corps may have “two different visions” of LAW diverging on how small it should be and what kind of defensive systems should go on the ship.

“I think what happened was that the Marine Corps has been running around saying ‘large ships are too vulnerable. We will never do a large-scale amphibious assault again. We need small ships to operate inside the weapons engagement zone.’ And the Navy and OSD have heard that and said ‘OK. OK. But what that means is we’re going to stop building large amphibs’” Cancian said.

Asked about the delay of the LAW program Cancian said the Navy and Marine Corps could be having a debate about what LAW should look like.

“I can imagine the discussion is about the size and capability of this ship. The Marine Corps had talked about something very small … disposable barely ocean-capable and with a limited lifetime” Cancian said.

“And I think the Navy may have balked at that – buying 30 ships with such limited capabilities and maybe having a discussion about buying something larger that would be globally deployable like the old [Landing Ship Tanks] which would of course be much more expensive but much more capable” he added. “You could put those out on a routine forward deployment. The ARGs – you could put them in ARGs which you can’t do with LAWs at least the original vision of the LAWs.”

Wood attributed the decision to delay LAW and end the LPD line to funding constraints pointing to the Columbia-class program the Constellation-class frigate and the Ford-class aircraft carriers as high priority programs where the Navy feels it cannot take any risks.

“It’s the whole category of amphibious capabilities is in competition with those other things so then it becomes risk management and where the Navy … can take risk” Wood said.

“There’s always been this question of how many amphibs? What do we think an amphibious force is going to do? Can it get close enough to an objective given the size of LPDs LSDs LHAs? So that’s been a problem for years anyway” he added.

Wood noted the question of survivability – which is where it appears the Navy and Marine Corps disagree on LAW – is a historic problem for Pentagon programs. As the services add more defensive capabilities or armor to platforms like the Defense Department did with mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles during the Iraq War they become more expensive. But Wood argued the Navy and Marine Corps cannot afford to go this route with ships.

“I don’t think there is any lost love. I think that the Navy and the Marines Corps services really do want to work well together and that they recognize the importance of naval power in an era where China poses the most substantial challenge to U.S. interests for the next two or three decades. It’s an inherently maritime environment in that part of the world” he said.

Marine Corps Dissension

Though embraced in the civilian analyst community the Marine Corps strategy underpinning the pursuit of LAW is facing heavy criticism from retired Marine generals and officers.

In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece last month former Navy Secretary Jim Webb described a coordinated effort by retired Marine Corps generals – including almost two-dozen four-stars – to voice apprehensions about Berger’s plans to reshape the force by shedding heavier armor and equipment like tanks.

“After several unsuccessful attempts by retired senior officers to engage in a quiet dialogue with Gen. Berger the gloves have now come off. The traditional deference has been replaced by a sense of duty to the Marine Corps and its vital role in our national security” Webb wrote. “Recently 22 retired four-star Marine generals signed a nonpublic letter of concern to Gen. Berger and many others have stated their support of the letter. A daily working group that includes 17 retired generals has been formed to communicate concerns to national leaders.”

This means Berger is not only navigating internal Navy dynamics over the budget and the future of the amphibious force structure but also outside criticism from his predecessors about his effort to reshape the Marine Corps.

“I think they have several concerns. One is that the Marine Corps’s getting smaller and will be challenged to meet its global commitments. One is that the structure is too focused on the western Pacific and the Marine Corps will not be able to participate effectively in operations in other areas” Cancian a retired Marine Corps colonel said of the officers’ concerns.

The Marine Corps has argued that its strategy which is focused on the Indo-Pacific would work in other regions across the globe.

“And the third is cultural that is that the infantry gets much smaller. Over the last 20 years the Marines’ infantry units have probably been cut in half. The focus of certainly the MLRs is on long-range precision strike in the artillery not the infantry” Cancian added. “And there’s a concern that – combined with some of the talent management proposals – that the Marine Corps is getting away from its roots of excellence in ground combat particularly close combat.”

As for the amphibious force structure Berger has argued the Marine Corps needs both the new smaller ships like the LAW and the larger amphibious warships that make up the Amphibious Ready Groups.

“There is not a tradeoff. Our capacity in the industrial base can handle both. And I know that not anecdotally but my conversations with leadership at places like Huntington Ingalls is [that] they have the capacity. And they are complementary capabilities” Berger said in February when asked if the Navy can build both LAW and the larger amphibs.

“They are not a substitute for each other because a traditional amphibious ship has all the attributes that we know and love so much over the years that a Marine Expeditionary Unit and Amphibious Ready Group have been using” Berger said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3Mvc2NhcmxldHQtam9oYW5zc29uLWZpbmFsbHktZmluZHMtYS1idXllci1mb3ItbWFuaGF0dGFuLXBlbnRob3VzZS1mb3ItbWFqb3ItbG9zcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scarlett Johansson finally finds a buyer for Manhattan penthouse — for major loss - realestate.com.au,"Scarlett Johansson has finally sold her longtime Manhattan penthouse for a substantial loss after nearly two years on the market.

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The quote is fabricated. There is no record of Ardern making such comments and a spokesperson for her office confirmed she did not.

THE FACTS: Posts sharing the bogus claim that Ardern made the comment about the News Corp founder circulated widely on social media on Saturday and Sunday.

“Asked why New Zealand does not suffer from the rage of older white men like in other western Anglo countries PM Jacinda Adern replied ‘Because we’ve never allowed Rupert Murdoch to set up a media outlet here’” one Twitter user wrote on Saturday in a tweet that has been shared over 37000 times. “The guy has wreaked havoc on civil society in US.”

But the quote is fake. Searches of news archives Google and transcripts from New Zealand Parliament’s House of Representatives show no record of Ardern ever making such remarks.

“We have no recollection of the Prime Minister making this comment and cannot find any source for it” Ardern’s office confirmed in a statement to the AP.

The bogus quote is similar to a real comment made by David Cormack a former director of policy and communications for New Zealand’s Green Party several years ago. Cormack told The Guardian in October 2020: “A huge reason that our politics is not so extremely polarised and so far out there is because we no longer have Murdoch-owned press in New Zealand and it’s never taken a foothold.”

News Corp has owned stakes in New Zealand media companies in the past including television provider Sky and New Zealand Media and Entertainment which owns newspapers radio stations and websites according to a report from the Auckland University of Technology’s research centre for Journalism Media and Democracy.

Ranked higher than new F-35B and C Lighting II Joint Strike Fighters or Joint Light Tactical Vehicles the number one item on the Corps’ FY 2023 unfunded priority list to Congress is $250 million in advanced procurement funding for a new Flight II San Antonio-class amphibious warship. That’s because the Navy doesn’t plan to buy the ship at the top of the Marine Corps’ wish list.

“The funding profile in the President’s budget submission essentially cancels the LPD program following the procurement of LPD-32 in FY23 a program originally planned to procure through LPD-42” Lt. Gen. Karsten Heckl the deputy commandant for combat development and integration told USNI News last week.

After years of working together on naval integration the line item is the latest example of a growing split between the Navy and Marine Corps showing how the services have come to an impasse over the future of the amphibious fleet.

Following the rollout of the Navy’s FY 2023 budget the state of the amphibious force structure is murky. The service’s budget proposal truncates the San Antonio-class LPD-17 Flight II production line and delays the Marine Corps’ new Light Amphibious Warship purchase.

The proposal – already receiving criticism in Congress – is exposing fissures between the two sea services over their visions for amphibious platforms.

There’s a growing divergence between the Navy and Marine Corps specifically about the LAW a smaller amphibious ship that’s key to the Marines’ Force Design 2030 initiative and Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations concept multiple naval observers told USNI News last week.

“There’s this difference of opinion in the philosophy behind the LAW which is why this debate about LPD-17 Flight II” is happening said Hudson Institute senior fellow Bryan Clark.

But with expensive bills like the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program and the Constellation-class frigate the Navy has insisted its budget proposal balances maintaining the force it has with modernizing for the future budget officials said on Monday.

“I think it’s money. I think if the Navy had enough money to fund all its high priority programs – aircraft carriers frigate the Columbia-class submarine and the Virginia-class attack submarines – as well as investing in the amphibious force I think they would do it in a heartbeat” Dakota Wood a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a retired Marine said of the Navy’s proposal regarding the amphibious ships.

While buying smaller amphibious ships has become a priority for the Marine Corps in recent years the service maintains it still also needs larger amphibious ships to complete its missions and meet combatant commanders’ needs.

The Marine Corps’ requirement remains 31 large amphibious ships – 10 big-deck LHAs and 21 LSDs or LPDs – which industry experts say should be constructed on four-year and two-year centers respectively Heckl told USNI News in a Thursday interview.

But the Navy’s plan to end the LPD-17 Flight II line – originally slated to include 13 ships – combined with plans to retire four Whidbey Island-class dock landing ships in the upcoming fiscal year would bring the amphibious inventory down to 25 ships in the next five years Heckl said.

“Amphibious warfare ships are being decommissioned faster than they are procured delivered and eventually available for employment” Heckl told USNI News.

Navy and Marine Corps Divergence

The division between the Navy and Marine Corps extends to Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday’s public comments.

Speaking on stage in February at the WEST 2022 conference in San Diego Calif. Gilday said the Navy needs nine LHAs and 19 or 20 LPDs/LSDs bringing the total number of large amphibious ships to 28 to 29 which is more in line with the 24 to 28 range in the Biden administration’s FY 2022 30-year shipbuilding plan.

“Perhaps 30 or more smaller amphibious ships [are needed] to support Maritime Littoral Regiments” Gilday said at the time referring to ships like LAW.

At the same conference Berger told reporters the amphibious requirements study – currently in its final stages – would likely call for approximately 31 amphibious ships. In the interview last week Heckl maintained that 31 is the “bare minimum” number for large amphibious ships.

Navy deputy assistant secretary for budget Rear Adm. John Gumbleton told reporters last week that LPD-32 would be the last amphibious transport dock the service plans to buy in the San Antonio class.

As evident from the top item on the unfunded list the Marines are against ending the line.

A senior congressional aide told USNI News that ending the LPD-32 line – which has largely been delivering on time and on budget from Ingalls Shipbuilding after problems in the program’s early years – is “short sighted.” Amphibious ships and the four proposed LSD retirements in the FY 2023 budget will likely be a crucial item of discussion as lawmakers draft the National Defense Authorization Act according to the aide.

“It’s going to be a debate on the overall amphib[ious] force structure in Congress this year so we’ll see how it all shines out in the end. But we will be debating the four LSDs and talking about amphib force structure writ large making sure we have the minimum number of ships the Commandant needs” the aide told USNI News.

The aide said lawmakers’ thinking is more in line with the Marine Corps’ vision of LAW as a more affordable ship the service can buy quickly and that Congress would likely push to buy the ship sooner than FY 2025. The Navy and Marine Corps need both intra-theater lift and forcible entry platforms – smaller amphibious ships like LAWs and larger ships like LHAs and LPDs respectively – to operate in the region the aide said.

“If your premise is that you support [these] intra-theater connectors LAW needs to move. And when I say move it needs to move forward” the aide said.

The Navy’s recent request also included LHA-9 – a ship Congress has already authorized and appropriated money for – so the House Armed Services Committee is considering the ship already procured the aide said.

Meanwhile the Navy doesn’t plan to buy the next LHA – LHA-10 – until FY 2031 meaning there would be an eight- or 11-year gap between LHA-9 and LHA-10 depending on the procurement year assigned to LHA-9 Heckl told USNI News. Delaying the ship’s purchase until then would make “maintaining the line completely untenable for industry particularly the supply base that construct[s] amphibious warfare ship components” the deputy commandant said.

As for LAW Heckl said there’s some risk in delaying the program because the Marine Corps has already begun standing up its Marine Littoral Regiments the formation the service converted and reshaped to move around smaller units aboard LAW.

“It’s bad. It’s very bad because at some point as we stand up more and more MLRs it requires more and more LAW to support them. And we’re only going to be able to go so far with leasing or finding other creative solutions with the Navy” he said.

Still the Navy has not formally released a Force Structure Assessment in more than five years making it difficult to understand where the service stands.

“We really don’t know where the administration’s at because we don’t have a Force Structure Assessment out there. This amphib study is one thing but even an amphib study with the lack of overall context about where we’re going at with regards to overall force structure it’s kind of missing the ball with regards to telling Congress about what the military’s requirements are” the senior congressional aide said.

Developing LAW

Since the Commandant became the Marine Corps’ top officer he has put forward proposals to reshape the service arguing it needs to become lighter and more mobile to move Marines around the Pacific in a potential conflict with China.

A crucial part of that vision is the Marine Corps using smaller less expensive amphibious ships to shuttle smaller units of Marines between islands and shorelines where they could set up ad-hoc bases. The LAW which would land Marines directly ashore is one of those smaller ships.

The idea according to the Marine Corps is that the Marines who move between islands and shorelines aboard LAWs could then fire anti-ship missiles increase the risk to the adversaries’ fleet and create chaos in the theater during a potential conflict.

While the Marine Corps has said the landing ships are key to moving its new MLRs around the Pacific the Navy has kept delaying the start of the program.

The first LAW purchase was originally slated for FY 2022 under the Trump administration’s December 2020 shipbuilding plan but delayed to FY 2023 in the Biden administration’s FY 2022 budget. Now the first purchase is scheduled for FY 2025. The current plan is to buy one the first year another in FY 2026 and two in FY 2027.

“The first LAW will not deliver within this FYDP” Heckl told USNI News in a statement. Heckl was referring to the Future Years Defense Program or the Pentagon’s five-year budget outlook.

Pushing the delivery of the first LAW past FY 2027 means the Marine Corps would receive the ship after the so-called “Davidson window” which refers to former U.S. Indo-Pacific Commander Adm. Phil Davidson’s testimony to Congress last March that China could try to take Taiwan in the next six years.

The Marines see LAW as an affordable smaller ship the Navy could purchase quickly for about $150 million per hull. But keeping LAW affordable has become difficult as the Navy evaluates the survivability of a ship that could end up operating in the South China Sea.

“I think they’re not on the same page. I think the Navy essentially wants to truncate the LPD-17 Flight II and use that money to instead by the Light Amphibious Warship with the idea that the Light Amphibious Warship is going to have to be fairly survivable to be viable inside these contested environments which means it will be relatively expensive” Clark told USNI News. “And therefore they need the money from the LPDs to pay for them because if you have a Light Amphibious Warship that costs $300 million – which is something that’s more in the scope of what the Navy’s thinking – then if you want to buy three or four per year that’s essentially an LPD-17.”

“That’s the direction the Navy wants to go. The Marine Corps wants to basically have both. They want to have the LPD-17 Flight IIs and then also buy the LAW because they view the LAW as a much … less survivable ship with the idea that they’re not going to drive it into highly contested environments. It’s intended to support mobility and then if they’re getting shot at they may not actually use it. They might keep it in port” Clark added.

Concerned about the history of the Littoral Combat Ship program the Navy has pushed for more requirements for LAW to make the ship more survivable while the Marine Corps still wants to quickly buy a less expensive amphibious ship Clark said.

“I think the debate is fundamentally [that] the Marine Corps feels they’re willing to take those risks and the Navy isn’t on board because the Navy’s worried about the kind of back-pressure they’re going to get from Congress or [the Office of the Secretary of Defense]” he added.

Mark Cancian a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said it appears the Navy and Marine Corps may have “two different visions” of LAW diverging on how small it should be and what kind of defensive systems should go on the ship.

“I think what happened was that the Marine Corps has been running around saying ‘large ships are too vulnerable. We will never do a large-scale amphibious assault again. We need small ships to operate inside the weapons engagement zone.’ And the Navy and OSD have heard that and said ‘OK. OK. But what that means is we’re going to stop building large amphibs’” Cancian said.

Asked about the delay of the LAW program Cancian said the Navy and Marine Corps could be having a debate about what LAW should look like.

“I can imagine the discussion is about the size and capability of this ship. The Marine Corps had talked about something very small … disposable barely ocean-capable and with a limited lifetime” Cancian said.

“And I think the Navy may have balked at that – buying 30 ships with such limited capabilities and maybe having a discussion about buying something larger that would be globally deployable like the old [Landing Ship Tanks] which would of course be much more expensive but much more capable” he added. “You could put those out on a routine forward deployment. The ARGs – you could put them in ARGs which you can’t do with LAWs at least the original vision of the LAWs.”

Wood attributed the decision to delay LAW and end the LPD line to funding constraints pointing to the Columbia-class program the Constellation-class frigate and the Ford-class aircraft carriers as high priority programs where the Navy feels it cannot take any risks.

“It’s the whole category of amphibious capabilities is in competition with those other things so then it becomes risk management and where the Navy … can take risk” Wood said.

“There’s always been this question of how many amphibs? What do we think an amphibious force is going to do? Can it get close enough to an objective given the size of LPDs LSDs LHAs? So that’s been a problem for years anyway” he added.

Wood noted the question of survivability – which is where it appears the Navy and Marine Corps disagree on LAW – is a historic problem for Pentagon programs. As the services add more defensive capabilities or armor to platforms like the Defense Department did with mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles during the Iraq War they become more expensive. But Wood argued the Navy and Marine Corps cannot afford to go this route with ships.

“I don’t think there is any lost love. I think that the Navy and the Marines Corps services really do want to work well together and that they recognize the importance of naval power in an era where China poses the most substantial challenge to U.S. interests for the next two or three decades. It’s an inherently maritime environment in that part of the world” he said.

Marine Corps Dissension

Though embraced in the civilian analyst community the Marine Corps strategy underpinning the pursuit of LAW is facing heavy criticism from retired Marine generals and officers.

In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece last month former Navy Secretary Jim Webb described a coordinated effort by retired Marine Corps generals – including almost two-dozen four-stars – to voice apprehensions about Berger’s plans to reshape the force by shedding heavier armor and equipment like tanks.

“After several unsuccessful attempts by retired senior officers to engage in a quiet dialogue with Gen. Berger the gloves have now come off. The traditional deference has been replaced by a sense of duty to the Marine Corps and its vital role in our national security” Webb wrote. “Recently 22 retired four-star Marine generals signed a nonpublic letter of concern to Gen. Berger and many others have stated their support of the letter. A daily working group that includes 17 retired generals has been formed to communicate concerns to national leaders.”

This means Berger is not only navigating internal Navy dynamics over the budget and the future of the amphibious force structure but also outside criticism from his predecessors about his effort to reshape the Marine Corps.

“I think they have several concerns. One is that the Marine Corps’s getting smaller and will be challenged to meet its global commitments. One is that the structure is too focused on the western Pacific and the Marine Corps will not be able to participate effectively in operations in other areas” Cancian a retired Marine Corps colonel said of the officers’ concerns.

The Marine Corps has argued that its strategy which is focused on the Indo-Pacific would work in other regions across the globe.

“And the third is cultural that is that the infantry gets much smaller. Over the last 20 years the Marines’ infantry units have probably been cut in half. The focus of certainly the MLRs is on long-range precision strike in the artillery not the infantry” Cancian added. “And there’s a concern that – combined with some of the talent management proposals – that the Marine Corps is getting away from its roots of excellence in ground combat particularly close combat.”

As for the amphibious force structure Berger has argued the Marine Corps needs both the new smaller ships like the LAW and the larger amphibious warships that make up the Amphibious Ready Groups.

“There is not a tradeoff. Our capacity in the industrial base can handle both. And I know that not anecdotally but my conversations with leadership at places like Huntington Ingalls is [that] they have the capacity. And they are complementary capabilities” Berger said in February when asked if the Navy can build both LAW and the larger amphibs.

“They are not a substitute for each other because a traditional amphibious ship has all the attributes that we know and love so much over the years that a Marine Expeditionary Unit and Amphibious Ready Group have been using” Berger said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3Mvc2NhcmxldHQtam9oYW5zc29uLWZpbmFsbHktZmluZHMtYS1idXllci1mb3ItbWFuaGF0dGFuLXBlbnRob3VzZS1mb3ItbWFqb3ItbG9zcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scarlett Johansson finally finds a buyer for Manhattan penthouse — for major loss - realestate.com.au,"Scarlett Johansson has finally sold her longtime Manhattan penthouse for a substantial loss after nearly two years on the market.

Last month Crawford County commissioners announced they will seek public input on a proposal that would effectively prevent the development of wind farms in the county during a public meeting at 1 p.m. Thursday April 21 in the youth building at the Crawford County Fairgrounds.

The hearing is part of a process set out by Senate Bill 52 which became law in July. The bill significantly changed Ohio's laws governing siting requirements for industrial solar and wind projects giving county commissioners the ability to prevent Ohio Power Siting Board certification of certain wind and solar facilities.

After the hearing commissioners can adopt a resolution designating unincorporated land in the county as a restricted area prohibiting construction of wind farms. If such a resolution is passed people who support wind farm development would have 30 days to circulate petitions to request a referendum vote on the decision.

What is Honey Creek Wind Farm?

Tyler Fehrman field manager for Apex Clean Energy: It is a proposed 300-megawatt wind farm in Crawford County. It will include about 60 wind turbines capable of producing enough power to power 85000 U.S. homes. The project would also generate up to $2.7 million for annual revenue in Crawford County with the money going to local schools infrastructure government services. It's all sited on open farmland that Apex Clean Energy has been leased from local farmers.

Who is developing Honey Creek Wind?

Fehrman: Apex Clean Energy is based in Charlottesville Virginia. It also has an office in Minneapolis Minnesota. The company founded in 2009 now has the largest clean energy development portfolio in the U.S. with more than 30 gigawatts ""which is just an absolutely amazing number."" It has roughly 300 employees and is growing rapidly.

How long has Honey Creek Wind been in development?

From T-F archives: Preliminary development started in 2011. Originally it would have consisted of about 115 wind turbines spread across 14000 acres of leased land in Crawford and Seneca counties. NextEra Energy Honey Creek Wind LLC announced it was pulling out of the project in October 2015.

Apex purchased the project in 2018 Fehrman said. The purchase included previously signed leases.

How big is Honey Creek Wind Farm expected to be?

Fehrman: ""We've signed over 40000 acres and that creates just the general boundary. As we site the turbines and we figure out what works and what doesn't that boundary shrinks so it becomes what we call the buildable area. So as of right now we're looking at 60 turbines and the turbines have to be spaced out between a quarter and a half mile apart.

""Then on top of that each turbine including the access road to that individual turbine typically requires less than half an acre all together. So if you do all of the math and you're very generous we're looking at maybe 50 to 60 acres in total that are taken out of farm production in that entire project area.""

Those 40000 acres are spread across Auburn Chatfield Cranberry Holmes Liberty Lykens and Texas townships he added.

How tall will the Honey Creek wind turbines be?

Fehrman: ""It is little bit of a moving target."" Developers submit a proposed project layout to the Ohio Power Siting Board but that body has the ability to make changes to the plan he explained. ""A lot of times they’ll shuffle things around and move them and where they get moved to often determines how many we have and how many we are allowed to place determines the size that we need.""

Apex is hoping Honey Creek will produce 300 megawatts using 60 turbines so that would mean using 4- to 5-megawatt turbines which are around 600 feet tall. ""And so they’re big but bigger turbines generate more power so you need less of them"" Fehrman said.

John Hensley vice president of research and analytics for the American Clean Power Association an industry group: Of 70000 to 80000 wind turbines currently operating across the country his organization's records suggest about 2000 are roughly 600 feet or taller.

""So they are at least at this point of time rare"" he said. ""And they tend to be done for a very specific reason for the site. ...

""As you think about a developer that's coming in to build a wind project they try to understand the wind resource the topography the geography potential siting restrictions that are in place and they work with the turbine manufacturer to basically select a configuration of turbine that works for that particular area. It gets more costly as you go higher up and put in a bigger turbine so they don't do that for no reason at all. ... Especially in areas that are land-constrained where it's difficult to get enough land leases or a large enough tract of land available to put in many smaller wind turbines then in some cases it makes sense to sort of consolidate and put in many larger wind turbines.

""We do see sort of a trend toward taller wind turbines but it hasn't been kind of that rapid yet.""

Among projects currently in development 520 feet is the average height Hensley estimated.

How deep are the footers for the wind turbines?

Fehrman: ""We go 10 feet deep and then we pour the visible above-ground circumference or the pad above ground ... about 16 feet all together. Which again takes up minimal land and makes it so that the folks can farm right up to them.""

He said that at public meetings he has attended people have challenged whether that's adequate.

""We have a team of very talented engineers and scientists who know what it takes and know what will hold up a turbine of this size"" he said ""It would be very poor unwise business practice for us to put less than was needed and risk losing a tower. That would not make sense for us because they're expensive.""

Hensley: The characteristics required for footers is very site-specific depending on things such as soil type wind speed and sheer expected or the height of the tower.

""In some cases footers are designed to be much more spread out; in other cases they're designed to be deeper. It's all very site-specific and a very kind of technical engineering question"" he said. ""We do know that in terms of raw concrete that goes into a wind turbine that it takes roughly on the order of 440 tons per megawatt of concrete to have a sufficient foundation.""

Will the excavation for footers disrupt the water table and neighboring wells?

Fehrman: ""That's not been an issue and we hear that quite a bit... if you think about tile which is all over farmland up there it's very similar. We're not going any deeper than is standard for other things that are dug and built down into the ground. We have to work through such rigorous processes with the state of Ohio and different agencies within the state to ensure we're not disrupting anything like that. We would not be allowed to site a project if there was a public health risk. And the state digs into that and makes sure that we can't. ...There's no risk to water tables there's no risk that we're going to leech anything into the soil that's harmful. It's just not an issue.""

What is Crawford Anti-Wind?

Lynette Moritz member: ""Crawford Anti-Wind is a group of concerned citizens dedicated to preserving our quiet beautiful rural settings wildlife property values and overall quality of life in the beautiful scenic settings in which we live and work. Together we form a grassroots effort to hold wind energy accountable to the impact on our surroundings and the cost to our communities now and for generations to come.""

The group became active as Crawford Anti-Wind early this year evolving out of Crawford-Seneca Anti-Wind which offered a series of informational meetings last year. Members of that group traveled to Columbus to support the passage of SB 52 which changed the rules for clean energy development in the state.

""In January of this year the group expanded and continued the work of those that had been in the battle for years"" Moritz said. A Facebook group YouTube channel and website were created.

Throughout the winter months volunteers went door-to-door and manned drive-thru signing events for petitions intended to convince commissioners that many Crawford County residents oppose the project. Members have distributed the now-familiar yellow and black yard signs; brought in anti-wind speakers; and attended township school board and county commissioner meetings.

The group's next informational meeting is scheduled for 7 p.m. April 14 in the Youth Building at the Crawford County Fairgrounds.

How can I contact Apex Clean Energy for more information?

Fehrman: The easiest way would be to visit the project's website. honeycreekwindpower.com and click the ""Meet the Team"" link which provides direct email address for all team members. Team members regularly attend county commissioner township trustee and other public meetings.

People also can leave a message for the team at 419-664-3769 or visit the office at 122 E. Main St. Bellevue.

Is Crawford County an Alternative Energy Zone? What is a PILOT fee?

From T-F archives: Under terms of an Alternative Energy Zone approved by Crawford County commissioners in 2011 renewable energy developers would not pay standard property taxes. Instead wind farm developers would make an annual Payment in Lieu of Taxes or PILOT fee of $9000 per megawatt nameplate capacity Commissioner Doug Weisenauer has said.

How much money would Honey Creek Wind bring to Crawford County?

Given the $9000 per megawatt PILOT fee a 300 megawatt wind farm would generate $2.7 million in payments to local government.

Fehrman: Apex also would make payments to a number of property owners: 319 leases 97 participation agreements 56 transmission right-of-way agreements and three access agreements.

Exact figures on how much Apex would pay those landowners are not available because ""it's a private agreement between us and our leaseholders"" Fehrman said. But it's stable income for landowners for decades.

The project also will create several hundred construction jobs in its construction phase and three to five permanent jobs once it begins operating Fehrman said. ""It will pump money into Crawford County"" he said.

How many Crawford County land owners have signed lease agreements?

Fehrman: 319 leases 97 participation agreements 56 transmission right-of-way agreements and three access agreements.

What happens if someone has signed a lease but that land isn’t used?

Fehrman: “It’s an individual case-by-case process” based on the terms of each lease agreement.

What will Apex do to limit noise issues?

Fehrman: ""A lot of time when you go and stand underneath a wind turbine they make a whooshing noise. But to me honestly it sounds like wind. ... We do have to do sound studies on every project and that means essentially we take sound monitors and we place them all around the entire project area. We have to measure the ambient noise level so we find the average ambient noise level for the entire project area and after we do that the state of Ohio requires that we are not allowed to raise the ambient sound level more than 5 decibels from the level found at the outside of a nonparticipating home.""

What is shadow flicker?

It's the effect caused when direct sunlight passes through a turbine's blades. Every time a blade passes there's a flicker effect.

How close can a wind turbine be to a house in Ohio?

Ohio law requires a setback of 1125 feet plus the length of the rotor radius from a nonparticipating property line.

How can county commissioners block wind farm development in Ohio?

In July Gov. Mike DeWine signed Senate Bill 52 which significantly changed Ohio's laws governing siting requirements for industrial solar and wind projects. It gives county commissioners the ability to prevent Ohio Power Siting Board certification of certain wind and solar facilities.

Commissioners can adopt a resolution designating any portion of unincorporated land in the county as a restricted area prohibiting construction of wind farms. If such a resolution is passed petitioners have 30 days to request a referendum vote on the decision.

What can commissioners do after a wind farm plan has been presented?

The law also requires developers to present their plans at a public meeting 90 prior to filing an application with the Ohio Power Siting Board. At the meeting they must present the scale of the project its maximum nameplate capacity and a map of the proposed geographic boundaries. The same information must be submitted in writing to county commissioners.

In the 90 days that follow commissioners may pass a resolution prohibiting the construction of the facility or limiting its boundaries to a smaller area. If commissioners take no action developers can proceed with seeking siting board approval.

What is the current timeline for the Honey Creek project?

Provided the county is not designated a restricted zone Apex plans to wrap up its studies this year ""and then choose a time to kick off the official application process"" Fehrman said. Ideally that would happen by the end of this year ""but we're looking at the last quarter at the earliest.""

""We haven't set the dates yet"" he said. The Ohio Power Siting Board process ""can take a while"" so there's no way to know when construction could begin.

Did SB 52 include any other changes to how wind farms are permitted in Ohio?

The legislation also adds two ad hoc members representing the community to the siting board while it reviews the local project — leaders of the township trustees and county commissioners. If a facility is in multiple townships all of the trustee members are to vote on a representative — or all commissioners would vote if the project involves multiple counties.

No one who has signed a lease or easement agreement with the developer of a utility facility or holds any other beneficial interest in a utility facility can serve.

How long would Honey Creek Wind be in operation?

Hensley: Wind projects being developed today are expected to operate for 30 to 35 years.

What happens when the project is decommissioned?

The new law also requires developers to submit a decommissioning plan along with their application.

Who pays to decommission the wind farm?

Fehrman: “Before we can ever begin construction on a project we have to purchase a decommissioning bond that is held by the state of Ohio. Then every five years the state of Ohio reanalyzes that bond for inflation rates and if there is a difference we have to pay the difference. That’s held the entire time.”

That guarantees that no matter what happens to the company owning a wind farm the project is removed he said.

Is there a deadline for how long PILOT fees can be offered?

The state's two-year budget bill also passed last summer extends the law allowing counties to offer a payment in lieu of taxes or PILOT fee option for renewable energy projects until the end of 2024.

After Duke lost Saturday to North Carolina in the Final Four and retiring coach Mike Krzyzewski’s career ended Nike published a couple of Tweets as part of a campaign that left social media users confused.

“You can’t spell championship without K” Nike Basketball’s verified account tweeted.

As many grade-schoolers know there’s no ‘K’ in the word ‘championship’ even if Krzyzewski’s nickname is “Coach K.” Maybe the ad would’ve landed better if he was known as “Coach C.” It’s just as difficult to spell Crzyzewski after all.

Krzyzewski won five national championships (all between 1991 and 2015) which is second only to UCLA’s John Wooden. But Krzyzewski holds a 13-12 edge over Wooden in career trips to the Final Four.

Nike also tweeted a video ad that showed a string of words that “you can’t spell without K.” The list: Honor respect brotherhood gold Cameron crazies Durham family legacy and coach.

The point? All those things are synonymous with a legendary career that ended in heartbreak at the hands of an archrival.

Shares of Nike (NKE 1.31%) are down 20% year to date but at the time of this writing the stock is up 2.5% since reporting earnings on March 21. The swoosh beat estimates for revenue and earnings per share and management reiterated its full-year outlook despite inflationary pressures and supply chain obstacles.

Inflation has been a cloud hanging over consumer and retail companies lately. Higher costs to import goods from factories overseas have created uncertainty around near-term profitability but Nike's latest earnings results show it has the demand for its product to weather the storm.

Let's look at a few details from the latest quarter that showcase this inflation-proof business.

Strong margins

With Nike revenue increasing by 8% year over year on a currency-neutral basis it's clear consumers are still shopping despite inflation. This rate of growth is not far off the pace from before the pandemic when Nike reported a currency-adjusted revenue increase of 11% in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2019.

Most importantly gross margin improved by 100 basis points to 46.6% in the quarter. Management attributed this performance to margin improvement in the Nike Direct business and a higher mix of full-price sales.

Here's a big-picture view of Nike's gross margin performance over the last 10 years. It hasn't been smooth but the figure has firmed up nicely over the last year just when it needed to the most.

Management's comments during the earnings call suggest that more margin expansion is possible in the near term. ""Marketplace demand continues to significantly exceed available inventory supply with a healthy pull market across our geographies"" CFO Matt Friend stated in the earnings report.

Nike Direct which includes online sales and Nike-owned stores saw revenue increase by 17% on a currency-neutral basis while Nike brand digital sales grew 22% over the year-ago quarter. Double-digit growth in the high-margin digital channel could push Nike's gross margin up further over the long term.

Hurdling over near-term obstacles

The only negative part of the report to stand out was a decline in earnings per share of 3%. However this was primarily caused by a higher effective tax rate. Nike's pre-tax income was up 2%. Profits grew slower than revenue due to higher operating expenses for marketing wage-related expenses and digital marketing to fuel demand.

Above all investors are relieved Nike didn't suffer from higher costs in the supply chain which was the main worry entering the quarter. Management reported that all factories in Vietnam are operational and nearly all suppliers are operating as usual without restrictions.

Moreover the company sees inventory supply beginning to improve from here but cautioned that transit times remain elevated. Despite these delays management still expects revenue for fiscal 2022 (which ends in May) to grow mid-single digits over last year with gross margin expanding 150 basis points for the full year.

""And as we look ahead to fiscal '23 we are optimistic as our brand strength is unparalleled with a strong product pipeline and momentum against our largest growth drivers"" Friend said during the earnings call.

Investors who own Nike stock should sleep well considering this top brand can still deliver solid business performance even when inflation spikes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2Utem9vbXgtdmFwb3JmbHktbmV4dC0yLXZvbHQtYnJpZ2h0LWNyaW1zb24tZHYzMDMwLTcwMC1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike ZoomX VaporFly NEXT% 2 Volt Bright Crimson DV3030-700 Release Date | SBD,"For Summer 2022 Nike Running will be releasing a brand new eye-catching colorway of the ZoomX VaporFly NEXT% 2

It was obviously fantastic to see the five-time Green Jacket winner out in a competitive environment but some couldn't help but notice something different about Tiger...

Hitting golf balls out on the range eagle-eyed viewers noticed that Tiger was wearing a pair of FootJoy Premiere Series Packard shoes  instead of his usual Nike. Although it is unclear as to why Tiger was wearing them it is possibly down to the injury he sustained in the serious car crash back in February 2021.

After the accident Tiger revealed that he came close to having his right leg amputated. However just 14 months on he has made a miraculously recovery with the possibility of a Masters appearance looking more and more likely each day.

Back in February Tiger admitted: “I can still play but I’m in a cart. Being a weekend warrior is easy that’s not that hard. Hit your ball hop in a cart ride barely step out of the cart grab your club and hit the next one. The longest walk you have is probably from what the cart to the green and back.

""I can do that that’s not that hard but walking a golf course that’s a totally different deal. Then walking out here for days on end long days. Don’t forget when my back was bad when we had rain delays and had to reactivate everything and go back out there again. I’ve still got that issue too. I’ve got a long way to go.”

However just six weeks after calling himself a ""weekend warrior"" the 15-time Major winner has made a serious recovery and managed to play a practice round on Tuesday with his son Charlie and close friend Justin Thomas.

What's more a source on the ground at Augusta National gave a positive account to ESPN stating: ""He played every one of them (18 holes). He looked good to me.""

North Carolina not only defeated its bitter rival on Saturday night to advance to the 2022 national championship game but also shut the door on Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski's career. The 75-year-old will leave the job to former Blue Devils guard Jon Scheyer after compiling 1202 wins 13 Final Four appearances and five national championships.

MORE: Why is Coach K retiring?

""I thought both teams played their hearts out"" Krzyzewski told TBS Sports' Tracy Wolfson after the Final Four game. ""It's an emotional win and it's an emotional loss. And that's the way a game like this should be.""

While Krzyzewski didn't seem interested in reflecting on the entirety of his career immediately following the loss there were plenty of Duke fans (and haters) eager to react. Nike paid tribute to the college basketball legend by asking its Twitter followers to share their favorite Coach K moments.

The official Nike Basketball account suggested the Blue Devils' win in the 1992 championship game — and then things got weird.

You can't spell championship without K. — Nike Basketball (@nikebasketball) April 3 2022

COACH K'S FINAL SEASON

Chapter 1: Ending the era

Chapter 2: Inside the greatest game

Chapter 3: Getting recruited by the legend

Chapter 4: Redeeming USA Basketball

Chapter 5: Coaching against K

You can't spell championship without K? Uh sure you can. In fact you don't need a K at all.

But wait there's more! In a new ad Nike told the world other words that can't be spelled without K. You know those classic K words such as . . .

Honor

Respect

Brotherhood

Gold

Cameron

Crazies

Durham

Family

Legacy

Coach

After double-checking with multiple sources at Merriam-Webster The Sporting News can confirm that none of these words includes the letter K.

Sure Nike was clearly going for messaging here rather than correct spelling. Krzyzewski embodies those words even if they don't feature any Ks. (The folks wearing Tar Heel blue may disagree.)

The execution was off though and it opened the door for plenty of jokes on social media. Nike wanted to celebrate Coach K but it has to take an L on this ad."

And this impressive list includes Tiger Woods.

The 86th edition of the iconic event will be held from 7-10 April at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta Georgia USA.

Unlike the rest of the major championships there are no qualifying tournaments or alternates for the Masters which is an invitation event and the most exclusive of the four majors.

The top 50 in the world are automatically invited along with former winners and recent champions and high finishers at professional and amateur tournaments.

There will be 91 men battling for the Green Jacket this week including Olympic champion Xander Schauffele.

The 28-year-old Californian qualifies by virtue of winning Olympic gold last summer at Tokyo 2020 although he is also in the top 10 of the world rankings.

Schauffele boasts a fine recent record at Augusta finishing tied for third 12 months ago behind Hideki Matsuyama and sharing second place in 2019 but you have to go back to the TOUR Championship in September 2020 for his last PGA Tour triumph.

Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River had set out to industrialise the state a move that drew the applause of residents and other people across the country. To achieve this supposed dream he established 38 factories across the state but from all indications these projects do not seem realisable. And the people are not happy as all that can be seen are mostly empty structures meant for the variously amplified projects.

Daily Trust reports that 95 per cent of these projects are still undergoing construction or have hardly taken off. Some seem to have been abandoned but government spokespersons would suggest that they are already up and running.

There are reports that the governor often unilaterally initiated these projects and the State House of Assembly would later merely endorse them. And members of his cabinet would hardly hear about them.

When the governor attended the rice pyramids exhibition in Abuja few months ago he announced that President Muhammadu Buhari would personally visit his state to commission two of his latest ‘ultra modern’ rice factory in Yala Local Government Area as well as a cocoa processing plant in Ikom few weeks after but the people took it with a pinch of salt. The cocoa plant has not churned out a single bar of chocolate ever since it was purportedly established.

The special adviser to Governor Ayade on cocoa development Oscar Ofuka said the factory had reached an advanced stage and that Nigeria would have no need to process its raw cocoa into beverages outside the country.

The president is yet to commission the two factories as the governor promised; perhaps he fears that he might be disappointed.

In September 2015 four months after the president took oath of office he flew into the state to do a groundbreaking ceremony for the superhighway the governor said would stretch from the fringes of Bakassi to the boundaries of Benue State as an evacuation corridor for another mega project the Bakassi Deep Seaport. The president had given the governor two years for him to return and commission the road project but few months to the end of his tenure the vast forests cleared for the superhighway are still there while protests and petitions by various communities and non-governmental organisations have not gone away.

Nothing is heard in that direction anymore except complaints from the state that the federal government was not giving it the desired support.

The same complaints are heard over the proposed deep seaport. So it is believed that the two amplified signature projects that signaled Ayade’s coming to power would not start let alone be completed.

Below are some of Ayade’s phantom projects:

Airline

Cally-Air one of the 38 projects said to have been established by Governor Ayade was thrown into a weighty controversy over ownership. Our correspondent reports that the state government actually bought two aircraft but without an airline operating licence it could not fly with the name Cally-Air. So they contracted Aero Contractors to operate it under their name.

After supposedly establishing the airline the state had started hiring and training staff in Lagos and assigning duties to them at Calabar Abuja and Lagos airports before going to source for statutory legal documents needed to operate in the industry.

It is said that Jake Otu Enyia the commissioner for aviation had no idea of the business. As a lawyer and accountant his only qualification for the job was that the governor saw the achievements he recorded as the director-general of the state electricity agency and being an outspoken member of the state House of Assembly.

“The governor believed much in my capacity so I had to start learning afresh on the job. So far it has not been disappointing. The Cally-Air project actually came on stream and everyone saw that the aircraft flew. We are at the verge of purchasing more aircraft. We want to run it as a private enterprise. We have interviewed the management staff” he had said.

Obudu airport

Also speaking about Obudu airport Enyia told journalists that “The Obudu International Cargo Airport is the smallest given the topography but almost all that is needed has been done. Jumbo aircraft will take off and land in Obudu. We are working towards commissioning it soon.”

Ayade further began to construct what he called Aerotropolis City a hangar where aircraft would be repaired.

Another drainpipe is the CallyPharm a firm expected to make pharmaceutical products. It is located beside the popular garments factory in the Ayade Industrial Estate a sprawling land mass where two more indolent factories are.

Equipment are reported to have been installed in the CallyPharm over two years ago but why it has not been opened for activities is a big question.

The Rice Seedlings Multiplication Laboratory situated nearby was always full of activities whenever the governor took his guests there but soon after that it would be locked.

The governor said the rice city was to churn out highly improved “Calas 77” seeds to the rest of Nigeria and generate N70 billion annually for Cross State.

Furthermore Vice President Yemi Osibanjo actually came to the state to formally commission the garment factory four years ago after hundreds of industrial sewing machines were installed. Workers mostly young women and so-called widows were engaged but there were reports that the state government could not pay them.

The garment factory appeared to be the only one functional as the public was told that some schools in Akwa Ibom and some units in the military had placed orders for uniforms and berets. Ayade had even boasted that he and his commissioners would only wear textile materials from the factory. This was not adhered to.

The governor further established a cotton factory in Yala Local Government Area to feed the factory.

Presently it is doubtful if this factory is making progress or even running at all.

There is another factory expected to produce feeds and fertiliser inside the industrial layout. It is fully equipped but is it operational?

Mega cities

As a way of building housing estates to decongest city centres the governor had taken far-reaching steps to build three new cities. He called them Calas Vegas. It was to be situated across the Calabar River in the southern senatorial district not far from The Peregrine his official residence. It is said that a staggering sum of money was sunk into dredging the water but so far only one bungalow was erected on the small reclaimed portion of the river.

The one to be built in the central district is called Centicourt while the one to be located in the northern district was to be known as Nostradam.

He created a New Cities Ministry and appointed a commissioner to oversee its activities. Some companies from overseas were contracted to ship prefabricated objects that would serve as houses for the cities. But so far nothing more is heard in that direction.

Bakassi housing estate

The governor made a show of this housing estate meant for returnees who were affected by the ceding of the peninsular to Cameroon following the judgement by the International Court of Justice. It was to the complement the efforts of the federal government to resettle the people. The project was however bedeviled by controversy as mostly government officials were alleged to have been allocated the apartments. The situation was saved on October 24 2020 when hoodlums under the infamous EndSARS protest ransacked it. Today it is a ghost town.

Power plant

To ensure that there was power supply constantly to the two Calabar local government areas (Calabar Municipality and Calabar South) Ayade established a 23-megawatt power plant along the Goodluck Jonathan bypass. He also planned to establish a 26-megawatt power plant in Tinapa city.

He invested a lot of action and time to ensure that it came on stream. He appointed Iyadim Amboni Iyadim now chairman of Bakassi Local Government Area as his special adviser on the project.

There were allegations that the power machines installed in the two locations were inferior. Up till now the two places are still in darkness.

Ayade had announced that his government would further establish two megawatts of electricity generating plants in each of the 18 local government areas of the state through the Industrial Project Services (IPS) from South Africa.

The public is yet to be told what has become of the poles piles and pylons of the factory situated on the way from Calabar to Ikom. A structure has been erected on a cleared forest site of about 10 plots of land. It was to manufacture plumbing materials and other things but production is yet to start.

Similarly the Yala roofing and tile factory is yet to commence operation. The governor had said that it would manufacture the best roofing sheets and tiles in West Africa.

Again there is the West African Fabrication Academy in the heart of Calabar meant to train jobless youths on how to fabricate machines of assorted types. Many youths showed interest not minding how it would turn out. But no action is yet taking place

The governor also decided to establish a groundnut oil processing factory to harness the potentials of the people of Bekwara Local Government Area who are known for growing groundnuts.

He also established the Obubra Cassava Processing Factory to harness the benefits embedded in the cash crop. But how many stores in the state have starch products for sale?

Another project that residents say exposes the state government’s insincerity is the one called Calachika Automated Poultry and Meat Processing factory. It is a poultry and chicken processing factory that functions only during the yuletide. Poultry structures are fully erected while the chicken processing house is undergoing construction.

A resident Ene Williams said “We hardly see chickens or broilers in this government poultry. But it will come to life during the Christmas season.

“For two seasons now government people would bring chickens and announce that they were reared here but that’s not true. They will then sell them at giveaway prices. After Christmas you will not see them again.”

Last December Governor Ayade said the factory was capable of producing birds and eggs that could feed the state and the entire South-South.

Another of Ayade’s project the people usually make open jest of is the endless construction of the so-called ‘Spaghetti flyover’ on the way out of Calabar. It was conceived to reduce the perennial traffic gridlock at the Odukpani junction. But only a pile of iron columns has consumed staggering resources and time.

There is also the Ayadecare Specialist Hospital which was to be established in the three senatorial districts of the state. It has not gone beyond the foundation stage.

More so there is the Canadian-British International School in Obudu his hometown which nomenclature he is soon going to change again. Its construction appears to have been completed the same way the Biase Teachers’ Training Institute has been completed. He said it would be modelled after such international schools. But can he effect action before his tenure wraps up?

The governor said people should not bother where he got money to initiate the factories for each of the 18 local government areas as according to him he uses “intellectual money.”

Ocean Going Vessel

Disclosing his idea of floating a Petrocross vessel to rake in revenue for the state he said he would ship ornament flowers sea foods and finished cocoa products from the state to the world.

Ejom Fidelis a concerned stakeholder said “I think our governor does not even know that he is biting more than he can chew. He is talking about ‘intellectual money’. How long can he survive on such undefined money? How much does the state generate now that its monthly allocation is becoming leaner than N2 billion?”

The governor had contracted a Ghanaian firm to use drone to fly essential drugs from Calabar to remote communities in the northern part of the state.

The immediate past commissioner for health in the state who has just become the All Progressives Congress (APC) woman leader Betta Edu commended the wisdom of her principal saying the project would ensure that hard-to-reach villages and the creeks are served. But the questions in the minds of residents are: Who has seen the drones? To which communities have they delivered the drugs?

Also where are the toothpicks in the factory at Ekori Yakurr Local Government Area? This factory was expected to provide employment opportunities for locals in that community.

What about the Banana processing farm at Odukpani? The plantation has completely dried out. The stunted bananas have all dehydrated and the plantation is overgrown with weeds. Not even one plantain stem has yielded since five years ago. And the cost of the plantation was put at N12billion according to a source in the Ministry of Agriculture.

The commissioner for agriculture Okon Owuna said they had a plan to regenerate it with an indigenous variety as against the ones that were imported.

However he was not sure if the present government could regenerate it before they leave power.

Ayade also wanted to ensure that Cross River children eat homemade noodles and macaroni so he established the Kisime Noodles.

Again what is happening to Ayade’s tomato and pepper cultivation and production industry in Yala and the state’s microfinance bank Cally Fishing Trawler and Company and the Cross River hide and leather factory?

As good and praiseworthy as his developmental ideas and projects are stakeholders said it would be a disservice to the state if they are not realised.

Speaking on the reason he embarked on the projects the governor had said “The food-on-the-table mantra of my administration is not just to dole out cash but to sufficiently engage the youth and vulnerable women as a way of dousing social tension. We have therefore deliberately built these 38 industries to boost individual and state pockets.”

No doubt Ayade means well. Should all his dreams and ideas be transformed to reality Cross River State would have become an industrial hub of the country.

Cross River Government speaks

Reacting to why the factories are not yet functional the senior special adviser to the governor on media and publicity Christian Ita said all the 38 firms initiated by the present administration would see the light of day.

He said some of them would have started operation but they were affected by the global COVID-19 lockdown.

According to him the foreign experts who were to install the machines in some of the factories could not come into the country until global movement became possible again.

He said one of the factories Calachika had started producing.

He added “Rice seeds and seedlings are producing. This factory only produces on demand because of the lifespan of the seedlings which is just 15 days. So you don’t produce and keep on the shelf.

“The garment factory has been producing since 2016 with at least 3000 women going to work daily.

“The noodles factory is ready and has undergone test production. It is awaiting certification by the National Agency for Food Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).

“The ultramodern rice mill Ogoja and the cocoa processing plant in Ikom are ready and will soon be commissioned by President Buhari.

“Piles and pylons in Akamkpa is already producing.”

He continued “Also Calapharm which is the pharmaceutical factory is undergoing minor design adjustment based on the recommendation of the World Health Organisation so as to meet its standard for drugs from the factory to be sold globally. Factories or industries are not built in a day.

“However the challenge is on the funding of the production phase. Factories don’t start making money the moment they start production. It is known as the gestation period. And the state does not have money.

“And since the governor has vowed not to sell any of the state’s asset government may be inclined to look at the option of concessioning in a bid to inject funding into them.

“This government still has one year to go and that’s enough time to tidy up the industries

“We had dreams beyond the carrying capacity of the state and that’s the way to go if we must develop and move forward.”"

Several local students competed in the State MATHCOUNTS competition held March 12 at Saginaw Valley State University.

Students from Mason Middle School and Bedford Junior High along with Martha Spencer from HIS Homeschool in Monroe participated in the competition. Mason which is coached by teachers Carson Manthey and Tara Stubleski punched its ticket to the state competition by winning the Southeastern Chapter contest held in February. Mason's Joanne Cai took first as an individual in that competition while Spencer from HIS Homeschool took second.

Bedford was the winner of an additional virtual competition that was held later in February.

While no local individuals placed in the top ten Patrick Lewis MATHCOUNTS Southeastern Chapter Coordinator said that everyone had fun.

The MATHCOUNTS Foundation is a nationwide program that was founded in 1983 to promote excellence in mathematics. The program also extends beyond simply the competition series by supplementing regular classroom exercises with challenging real-world engineering-type problems.

More than 5000 schools typically participate nationwide in the competition series with another 2500 club schools also benefiting from program materials. The MATHCOUNTS program title sponsors are Raytheon Technologies and the U.S. Department of Defense and is also sponsored nationally by the National Society of Professional Engineers the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics CNA Foundation Northrop Grumman Foundation Texas Instruments the 3M Foundation and the Art of Problem Solving. Further information is available at www.mathcounts.org.

The competition consists of four rounds three written and one oral. In the Sprint Round students have 40 minutes to answer 30 questions without the aid of calculators. Target Round problems are multi-step and students have 6 minutes to answer each of 4 pairs. In the Team Round students have 20 minutes to answer 10 questions and must work as a team to reach mutually agreeable solutions.

The Countdown Round is a fast-paced oral round in which the top ten individuals based on the written portions square off for place standing and advancement to the State competition. Students are read a question which they have 60 seconds to answer. They must answer three questions correctly to advance to the next round.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMjA0MDMtdXMtZGVmZW5zZS1jb250cmFjdG9ycy1zZWUtbG9uZ2VyLXRlcm0tYmVuZWZpdHMtZnJvbS13YXItaW4tdWtyYWluZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US defense contractors see longer term benefits from war in Ukraine,"New York (AFP) – US arms manufacturers are not cashing in directly from the thousands of missiles drones and other weapons being sent to Ukraine but they do stand to profit big-time over the long run by supplying countries eager to boost their defenses against Russia.

Like other Western countries the United States has turned to its own stocks to furnish Ukraine with shoulder-fired Stinger and Javelin missiles for instance. These weapons from Lockheed-Martin and Raytheon Technologies were paid for some time ago.

So these companies' first quarter results due to be released in coming weeks should not be especially fatter because of the rush to arm Ukraine as it fights off the Russian invasion.

But those US military weapons stockpiles being tapped for Kyiv will need to be replenished.

The Pentagon plans to use $3.5 billion earmarked for this purpose in a spending bill approved in mid-March a Defense Department spokesman told AFP.

The Javelin anti-tank missile is made by a joint venture between Lockheed and Raytheon. The latter's Stinger anti-aircraft missile had ceased to be produced until the Pentagon ordered $340 million of them last summer.

""We are exploring options to more quickly replenish US inventories and backfill depleted stocks of allies and partners"" the spokesman said.

""It will take time to revive the industrial base -- at the prime and at sub-tier suppliers -- to enable production to resume"" he added.

The profits that the companies make from these missiles known for being simple to use will not exactly be staggering defense industry experts told AFP.

""If 1000 Stingers and 1000 Javelins get shipped to Eastern Europe each month for the next year which is not unlikely given the current pace in our view we think it would equate to $1 billion to $2 billion in revenue for both program manufacturers which is material"" said Colin Scarola of CFRA an investment research firm.

Raytheon's and Lockheed's revenue figures last year dwarf that amount however: $64 billion and $67 billion respectively.

""Raytheon probably made more money off selling a Patriot missile system to Saudi Arabia than they will from making Stinger missiles"" said Jordan Cohen an arms sales specialist at the Cato Institute.

""They're only going to put so much effort into producing those weapons that are not that valuable"" Cohen told AFP.

Lockheed Raytheon and another arms manufacturer Northrop Grumman did not respond to AFP requests for comment.

General Dynamics said it has not raised its financial outlook since January while Boeing just said it is up to governments to decide how to spend money earmarked for defense.

- Competition among major powers -

Some weapons manufacturing executives hinted when they last released quarterly results in late January that the situation around the world would benefit them.

Greg Hayes Raytheon's CEO said that rising tensions in Asia the Middle East and Eastern Europe would lead to higher international sales -- not right away but later in 2022 and beyond.

His counterpart at Lockheed-Martin James Taiclet said he observed ""renewed great power competition"" that could trigger higher US military spending.

""The war in Ukraine reshuffles the geopolitical order in a way that hasn't really been seen in the past 30 years"" said Burkett Huey of Morningstar a financial services company.

""People are starting to realize that the world is a lot less safe and there's probably going to need to be increased investment in defense products which would benefit the contractors"" Huey said.

Eric Heginbotham a researcher at the MIT Center for International Studies said that for Western governments -- as has been the case for years in Asia -- ""there will be much less appetite for decreases"" in military spending.

In the United States President Joe Biden has proposed a four percent increase in the Pentagon budget. Inflation in America is running much higher but Biden at least did not propose spending cuts.

Germany long wary of high military budgets announced a major policy shift in late February after the Russian invasion of Ukraine saying it would immediately free up 100 billion euros to modernize its armed forces.

""Countries are going to be looking to increase interoperability with the United States which is really sort of the central pillar in NATO"" said Heginbotham.

In mid-March Germany said it would acquire F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed. It will take several years for them to be delivered and it is then when manufacturers get paid for the most part.

This ""sort of F-35-ification of European armies"" is good business for US military contractors and the US military also likes it because it means common operating platforms said Eric Gomez a defense policy expert at the Cato Institute.

""But on the other side it makes it harder for the United States to kind of ever consider stepping back from Europe as the Biden administration keeps saying that China is the big game in town"" said Gomez.

On 31 March 2022 the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) has awarded contracts to the Boeing ABILITI Consortium the Airbus and Northrop Grumman ASPAARO team and General Atomics to conduct Risk Reduction and Feasibility Studies (RRFS) as part of the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control (AFSC) initiative.

These studies will help redefine the next steps on how North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) will conduct surveillance and control after the planned retirement of the current Boeing E-3A Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) fleet around 2035.

In July 2021 NSPA launched the competition for Risk Reduction and Feasibility Studies to develop and analyse the feasibility of three promising concepts identified during the initial high-level concept studies. 65 companies were nominated to participate in the bidding. The Agency awarded three contracts one per study from the seven bids received. Each contractor has been awarded a EUR 155 million contract to develop and detail a realistic Technical Concept and analyse its feasibility and risks for implementation.

The industry team led by Boeing will study how best to replace NATO’s E-3A AWACS system which will retire in 13 years. Boeing is doing a similar study for the USAF centered on the Boeing E-7 Wedgetail platform which Air Force leaders recently hinted could be the replacement for retiring the E-3 AWACS with the USAF. It is not known on what type of asset the other two teams are concentrating.

The E-3A AWACS has been NATO's key surveillance and control asset since the 1980s and will retire around 2035 after 50 years of service.

Manufacturer GA-ASI says that Australia’s Department of Defence (DoD) has advised it of the decision.

“The cancellation is disappointing for a number of reasons” says GA-ASI president David Alexander.

“Project Air 7003 offered a cost-effective multi-domain capability that is deeply relevant to Australia’s future strategic environment. Equally disappointing our many Team SkyGuardian Australia partner companies have invested in the start-up and future support for this capability in Australia and will lose considerable sovereign capability opportunities following this decision.”

In response to a query from FlightGlobal the DoD had this to say about the decision: “Based on advice from Defence the Government has decided to not proceed with Project AIR 7003 – Armed Medium Altitude Long Endurance Remotely Piloted Aircraft System. The decision allows Government to allocate that money to expand our response to attacks against Australia online through the REDSPICE program. A mix of other joint capabilities such as [Northrop Grumman] MQ-4C Triton and [Gulfstream] MC-55A Peregrine aircraft Teaming Air Vehicles and [Boeing] Apache Helicopters will conduct roles expected of the SkyGuardian.”

REDSPICE is a major investment the Australian government is making to beef up the Australian Signals Directorate.

In November 2019 Canberra selected the MQ-9B under its AIR 7003 requirement for an armed UAV with the MQ-9B pipping another GA-ASI system the MQ-9A Reaper. Previously the two UAVs had seen off a rival offering in the form of the Israel Aerospace Industries Heron TP.

At the time of the MQ-9B’s selection then defence minister Linda Reynolds said a proposal would be drawn up for the government to consider in the 2021-2022 timeframe.

Adds Alexander: “Project AIR 7003 was expected to provide the Australian Defence Force with a reliable and desperately needed capability: an armed medium-altitude long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft system providing persistent airborne intelligence surveillance reconnaissance [ISR] electronic warfare and precision strike capability for both land and maritime environments.”

Separately Canberra’s acquisition of the Northrop MQ-4C Triton remains intact with its three contracted examples being manufactured in the USA. This acquisition will ultimately amount to six or seven examples.

In addition Boeing and the Royal Australian Air Force continue joint development work on the Boeing MQ-28A Ghost Bat known internationally as the Airpower Teaming System.

Canberra has ordered six examples of the system which is designed as low-cost ‘attritable’ aircraft aimed at building out force numbers. The MQ-28A allows for different mission payloads – including those optimised for ISR work – to be swapped in and out of its nose.

Canberra is also obtaining four Gulfstream G550s equipped for the electronic warfare mission with these designated as the MC-55A Peregrine.

A total of 56 Solo Oceanview Staterooms will be available on four vessels starting in September this year

Oceania Cruises recently announced in a press release on Wednesday the addition of dozens of dedicated staterooms for solo travelers.

The cruise line also disclosed the debut of “Go Green” and “Beyond Blueprints” shore excursion series.

As the solo travel trend continues to grow Oceania Cruises — Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd— sees great potential in these independant travelers. Starting in a few months four company vessels will include 14 solo oceanview staterooms. A total of 56 staterooms for independent explorers.

The new architectural design will be first seen on deck 6 aboard the Regatta on September 25 then on Nautica on September 26 and on Insignia and Sirena on October 1 this year.

Howard Sherman President & CEO of Oceania Cruises explained more about this decision: “One of the greatest factors in Oceania Cruises' success is that we not only listen to the feedback our guests and travel partners provide we act on it. Our guests and travel partners wanted more options for solo travelers and more diverse tour offerings and we are delighted to deliver.”

Oceania Cruises is digging deeper into its customers’ needs and going beyond providing a luxurious cruise service the possibility to explore impressive destinations worldwide —including around the world cruises— and outstanding culinary experiences.

Now the company includes solo travelers' cabins environmentally respectful tours and thoughtful excursions that allow visitors to connect more with the culture nature and environment of the destinations visited.

The Solo Oceanview Staterooms

The idea to offer solo travelers their own cabin has been on Oceania Cruises’ plans for some time now. The company first experimented to offer this service on their Vista vessel earlier this year and the result was a great success. After that sell-out triumph the cruise line decided to implement it on more ships.

The new staterooms have been created bearing in mind a solo traveler's needs: to feel comfortable relaxed and taken care of. The cabins have been carefully designed including soothing tones luxurious furnishing artwork a refrigerated minibar ample storage space and a convenient Tranquility Bed.

Sherman said: “These new single-occupancy staterooms are ideal for guests seeking the joy of traveling solo while experiencing all the comfort cuisine and destination expertise that Oceania Cruises is renowned for.”

The prices for these new single-occupancy cabins have not been revealed yet. According to the information shared by the cruise line the new oceanview staterooms will be available for reservations within a few days on April 11 for sailings beginning in September.

Go Green And Beyond Blueprints Tours

Oceania Cruises will be offering over 150 Go Green tours across different countries and destinations to allow travelers the possibility to engage with residents and local businesses who have developed projects to conserve and sustain the environment.

These tours promise to be entertaining educational and life-changing. The cruise line shared a few examples of what their customers can expect. One of the Go Green tours takes place in Bordeaux France and travelers will be able to visit the Château de La Dauphine a biodynamic and organic vineyard that has improved its wine quality by respecting the cycles of nature —including the moon and planets movements— and applies pesticide-free agricultural methods.

From visiting a sanctuary for sloths in Costa Rica to a fascinating hike at the Bach Ma National Park in Vietnam the Go Green tours are designed to please different interests and provide a great variety of experiences.

The Beyond Blueprints tours on the other hand will focus on “the world’s most iconic architectural landmarks” and include in-depth encounters. Travelers will be able to choose from 10 tours in Europe which include The Royal Library in Copenhagen Denmark; La Villa Méditerranée and MUCEM Marseille France; and the Equinor office building and the Munchmuseet in Oslo Norway.

At the center of it all this year is Dua Lipa the pop star who keeps getting better and better. Based on Dua Lipa’s Grammys 2022 look she knows it too. Dua Lipa attends the 64th annual Grammy Awards as a three-time award winner and eight-time nominee.

Though Dua Lipa isn’t nominated for any awards this year she is presenting at the show. She’s had plenty of time on stage this year—she just finished the US leg of her Future Nostalgia tour this week. The singer is known for having iconic looks for her on-stage performances but also has quite the knack for street style. It’s impossible to turn on the radio right now and not hear one of Dua Lipa’s incredibly catchy songs. It’s getting just as hard to open Instagram without seeing Lipa in a trend-setting outfit.

More from StyleCaster

From white sandy beaches to award show red carpets it’s evident that Dua Lipa knows exactly what she’s doing. Tonight she wore a vintage Versace gown which screams ’90s. The black floor-length gown is one of my all-time favorites as it has an element of edge while still remaining elegant. The top features a bondage-style criss-cross bra and the gold chains seriously have me drooling.

The dress was originally worn by Cindy Crawford back in the ’90s who rocked it with her long signature brown locks. Dua Lipa switched up the look a bit by rocking a platinum blonde ‘do that extended down to her torso. Her matte burgundy lipstick and razor-sharp nails added a modern twist to the vintage gown.

This outfit is a total 180 from Dua Lipa’s Grammy vibe from last year. Although she stuck with Versace the dress had a much softer vibe. Lipa wore a shimmering Atelier Versace dress in soft pink and blue hues.

And while Kate certainly left her mark as a romantic heroine in the most recent episodes we can’t stop thinking about another jewel of the season: Queen Charlotte and her luxurious hair.

Her Royal Highness again served up memorable looks in Season 2 highlighted by her seemingly endless supply of opulent wigs. Ranging in length texture and even color these heavenly hairpieces command as much attention as their sovereign head bearer.

“I make sure I stay hydrated becaus​e it’s such an intense wear” Golda Roshuvel who plays Queen Charlotte told TVLine. “I weighed myself one day with a light costume and a light wig and I gained two stone (28 pounds). I’m carrying around that weight all day and that’s a big toll on the body.”

In honor of those efforts we’re spotlighting Her Majesty’s unforgettable tresses throughout both seasons. Here are Queen Charlotte’s 25 royally fabulous wigs ranked.

The singer’s dress looks like it was lifted straight out of a watercolor painting with a variety of colors like bold yellow red and green tones. The look featured capped shoulders and the sleeves flowing at the wrist.

Jackson further styled the look with a top-knot bun burgundy nails and a multitude of rings.

Jackson can often be seen wearing more structured outfits featuring a corset or similar tailoring. One designer that is often Jackson’s go-to for the red carpet would be none other than punk-fashion legend Vivienne Westwood.

Nvidia's (NVDA 3.77%) dividend yield an afterthought for most investors is currently sitting at 0.06%. That is partly due to a stock price that has climbed faster than the company's dividend payments. On that score the company hasn't increased its dividend in over two years. As the company's profits have climbed on the back of strong demand for advanced graphics chips and data center systems the dividend payout ratio has dropped to less than 5%.

Here are a few reasons the company should consider returning more income to shareholders.

Nvidia's cash flow and payout history

Nvidia's profit margin improved significantly in recent years as the mix of revenue shifted to data center chips and high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) for gamers that command steep selling prices.

Over the last five years the company's free cash flow which is the amount of cash the company can spend on reinvestment in operations acquisitions dividends and share repurchases climbed 457% to $8.1 billion. That represents a high margin of 30% on $26.9 billion in fiscal 2022 revenue.

Management seems to have anticipated the company's fortunes nine years ago. Nvidia initiated its first quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share in fiscal 2012 (ended in January 2013). That year Nvidia generated $640 million in free cash flow on $4.3 billion in revenue or a free cash flow margin of about 15%.

But over the last five years Nvidia's free cash flow has increased more than 400% while the dividend has only increased 25%. Other companies that design or manufacture chips such as Apple Intel and Broadcom pay out anywhere from 14% to 58% of their free cash flow in dividends. These companies face just as much competition for their products yet they far outspend Nvidia in returning cash to shareholders through dividends.

Nvidia can afford a higher payout

Nvidia can certainly afford to double its payout to at least 10%. The total spent on dividends last year was $399 million but Nvidia has spent far more on share repurchases. Since August 2004 management has spent over $7 billion repurchasing shares. After spending $2 billion to repurchase shares in the recent quarter they currently have another $5 billion left on their share repurchase authorization through the end of December 2022.

The recent $2 billion buyback at these high valuation levels is questionable. Nvidia previously spent $1.6 billion to buy back shares in 2018 when the stock traded at an attractive valuation of around 20 times earnings. Management did not repurchase any shares between 2020 and 2021 as the stock's valuation soared.

So why did management repurchase shares recently with the stock trading at a nosebleed valuation of 69 times trailing earnings? It would have made more sense from a capital allocation perspective to shift at least some of that cash return to dividends as opposed to buying back shares at these levels.

Furthermore Nvidia's share repurchases have been completely ineffective in enhancing shareholder returns over the last 18 years. The annual diluted share count has increased 20% over that time which means the amount spent on buybacks has only partially offset the dilution to shareholders.

At the end of January Nvidia was sitting on a net cash balance of $10.3 billion and given management's anticipation of further growth in free cash flow that cash balance should continue to pile up over the long term.

Demand trends in data centers and gaming should continue to lift gross margin and Nvidia's profitability. Management expects new software opportunities with Nvidia AI Enterprise and Nvidia Omniverse will benefit the company's bottom line. ""Each one of these software offerings has a multibillion-dollar revenue potential and should contribute positively to our gross margins over time"" said CFO Colette Kress at Nvidia's recent investor day.

Given Nvidia's expanding margins and opportunities Nvidia should reconsider its capital return priorities. If the company is not going to reduce the share count and boost returns to investors with repurchases it should shift more of its capital returns to dividends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL252aWRpYS1zaGllbGQtcHJvLTIwMTktcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia Shield Pro (2019) review: As powerful as it is expensive,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL252aWRpYS1zaGllbGQtcHJvLTIwMTktcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9waWNrcy9maXJzdC1sb29rLWFsbC10aGUtbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwOTAtdGktY2FyZHMtc28tZmFy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Look: All the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Cards So Far,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.pcmag.com/picks/first-look-all-the-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-cards-so-far on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9waWNrcy9maXJzdC1sb29rLWFsbC10aGUtbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwOTAtdGktY2FyZHMtc28tZmFy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2FpL2plbnNlbi1odWFuZy1wcmVzcy1xYS1udmlkaWFzLXBsYW5zLWZvci10aGUtb21uaXZlcnNlLWVhcnRoLTItYW5kLWNwdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jensen Huang press Q&A: Nvidia's plans for the Omniverse Earth-2 and CPUs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/ai/jensen-huang-press-qa-nvidias-plans-for-the-omniverse-earth-2-and-cpus/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2FpL2plbnNlbi1odWFuZy1wcmVzcy1xYS1udmlkaWFzLXBsYW5zLWZvci10aGUtb21uaXZlcnNlLWVhcnRoLTItYW5kLWNwdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Stanley began her coaching career when ODU hired her at age 23 in 1977. The Monarchs captured back-to-back AIAW national titles in 1979 and 1980. ODU went 35-1 in 1978-79 and 37-1 in 1979-80. In 1985 the Monarchs topped Georgia 70-65 for their first NCAA title. ODU also won the WNIT crown in 1978.

Stanley was named the AIAW National Coach of the Year in 1979 and was a five-time Virginia Coach of the Year. Two of her ODU players Nancy Lieberman and the late Anne Donovan are in both the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame and Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame. Stanley was also inducted into the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002.

After ODU Stanley went on to coach at Penn USC Stanford and Cal. She then moved on to the WNBA where she started as an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Sparks in 2000 and Washington Mystics in 2001.

The 2022 class will be enshrined into the Naismith Hall of Fame on Sept. 10 in Springfield Massachusetts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL2NhbC9iYXNrZXRiYWxsL21hcmlhbm5lLXN0YW5sZXktaGFsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cal Women's Basketball: Ex-Bears Coach Marianne Stanley Voted into Hall of Fame,"One-time Cal women’s coach Marianne Stanley was part of a 13-member class 2022 elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame it was announced on Saturday.

Stanley currently the coach of the WNBA’s Indiana Fever is best known for winning three national championships while coaching Old Dominion — back-to-back 1979-80 AIAW crowns and the 1984 NCAA title.

“Still pinching myself"" Stanley said at a news conference Saturday.

The new Hall of Fame class is headlined by four-time NBA champion Manu Ginobili five-time NBA All-Star Tim Hardaway three-time WNBA champion and two-time gold medalist Swin Cash and five-time WNBA All-Star and four-time WNBA champion Lindsay Whalen.

Others in the 2022 class include two-time NCAA Coach of the Year Bob Huggins and longtime NBA coach George Karl.

The enshrinement ceremony is set for Sept. 10 in Springfield Massachusetts.

""The Class of 2022 is ripe with individuals who have had a significant historical impact on the game we love"" Hall of Fame president and CEO John L. Doleva said in a statement. ""We congratulate and thank them for everything they've done to better the sport and look forward to honoring them during Enshrinement this fall.”

Stanley’s time at Cal made no real contribution to her Hall of Fame honor. She coached the Bears for four seasons (1996-97 through 1999-2000) compiling a record of 35-75 overall and 16-56 in Pac-10 play

Her stint coaching the Bears’ was in the midst of 12 consecutive losing seasons that ended when Joanne Boyle arrived for the 2005-06 campaign and posted an 18-12 record including a 10-8 conference mark.

Regarded as a pioneer in women’s coaching Stanley 67 became head coach at Old Dominion in 1977-78 leading the Monarchs to the WNIT. In 1979 and ’80 ODU won AIAW titles and in ’85 she coached the team to a 31-3 record an an NCAA crown.

Stanley was named WNBA Coach of the Year with the Washington Mystics in 2002 her first season as the franchise’s head coach. She was named to the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame that same year.

Stanley also coached at Penn USC and Stanford and overall has spent 45 years as a head coach or assistant at the college or professional level.

In 1993 she filed an equal-pay lawsuit against USC contending Trojans men’s coach George Raveling was unfairly paid more. Stanley eventually lost the suit.

Stanley played at Immaculata College (1972-76) leading the team to the first three official national championships in the very early era of women's college basketball. Those 1972-74 Immaculata teams were part of the 2014 Naismith Hall of Fame class.

In 1975 the team played in the first nationally televised women’s college basketball game beating Maryland 80-48 at Cole Field House.

A month later Stanley played in the first women’s game ever staged at Madison Square Garden with Immaculata beating Queens College 65-61.

“It was my junior year when I actually said ‘You know what? I might be able to make this a career’” Stanley said of her first thoughts she might go into coaching.

“My undergrad degree is in sociology. I just wanted to help young people. How that was going to play out I had no idea. After Title IX became law and things started to change and that took a few years that career path actually was there. Prior to that no.”

This is achieved using a process called lithography. First a sacrificial light-sensitive material known as a photoresist is placed onto the surface of the chip. Next a mask is placed over the chip to only allow light onto certain areas of the chip. When the light hits the photoresist a reaction occurs that chemically alters the material. The chip is then exposed to a developer which removes only the material that was exposed to the light. As a result the pattern from the mask is transferred onto the photoresist on the chip. This pattern is then used to layer on other materials such as metals and insulators using a method called etching. The entire process is repeated multiple times until the semiconductor is built. Each time a new material is added to the chip the photoresist material must be completely dissolved through a process known as “wafer cleaning” before the next layer is added.

Manufacturers build chips using either a “positive tone” or a ""negative tone” process. During the positive tone process the photoresist material that’s been exposed to the light is dissolved and removed. During the negative tone process the areas that interact with the light are made insoluble and remain behind. However the underlying chemistry of the negative tone process is different and is much harder to remove in the wafer cleaning step. Traditional solvents used for the positive tone process are no longer effective for these negative-tone resists and longer cleaning processes using more aggressive chemicals are required.

“There are a number of problems that can happen with using negative-tone resist processes in manufacturing” explains David Rennie US Technical Service Manager. “First if you don’t dissolve the photoresist materials fully within each step you end up with leftover particles which can produce defective chips. It also can clog filters in the cleaning equipment which are expensive to replace and requires the production line to stop and the whole batch of cleaning solvent — around 10 gallons of chemicals — to be discarded. Undissolved resist will also shorten the effective life of the solvent which increases chemical consumption. Second if you use more aggressive chemicals you can damage the metallic components of the chip rendering them unusable. And third the number of wafers produced each hour will decrease because the cleaning step in the negative tone process takes longer. Overall this means fewer usable semi-conductors are produced for each batch of solvent and more chemical waste is generated.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZW50ZXJwcmlzZS5wcmVzcy93aGF0c25leHRzL2xvY2FsLWNoaXAtZGVzaWduLXNlY3Rvci1nZXR0aW5nLWJvb3N0LWNoaXAtc2hvcnRhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The local chip design sector is getting a boost from the chip shortage,"Egyptian chip designers aren’t letting a good crisis go to waste: While the global semiconductor shortage has posed a threat to many businesses working in electronics assembly and manufacturing there’s a sector that has been flourishing due to the current situation. Semiconductor chip design — a sector that has many players in the Egyptian market — has seen increased growth prospects as electronics companies abroad try to ensure that they have a viable semiconductor scene within the company or through outsourcing. Enterprise talked to a number of these semiconductor companies to judge the appetite for the local sector and the challenges they face to reach their full potential.

The local chip design industry is getting a boost from the increased demand: Vidatronic — a US firm which has an office in Egypt specializing in creating semiconductor IPs for companies abroad — has seen demand for its services increase since the chip shortage started Director of Design Engineering Sameh Ibrahim told Enterprise. “The added interest in semiconductor design globally has put more focus on Egypt due to the high quality of engineers we have” he said. Vidatronic has clients such as Samsung and more recently Intel Foundry Services (IFS) as part of its IFS Accelerator – IP Alliance.

So much so that new players are entering the semiconductor design market: At least three new chip design companies are launching in Egypt in the coming period Ibrahim told us. One of these companies is InfiniLink which came on the back of the chip shortage driven by the huge demand for engineering talent who can build those chips Co-founder and CTO Botros George said. InfiniLink is an independent semiconductor design company that is being launched in partnership with MediaTek — one of the largest fabless semiconductor companies in the world Co-founder and CEO Ahmed Aboul Ella explained. The company will begin working with its customers to build next-generation connectivity chips for hyper scale data centers and enterprise application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). “There’s a lot of room in the semiconductor space to create value at the moment especially if you have the know-how” Aboul Ella said.

Will VCs jump on this new space? There’s a big chance they will Pearl Semiconductors Vice President of Marketing & Business Development Mostafa El Khouly told Enterprise. Pearl – which is backed by Sawari Ventures and Si-Ware Systems — has seen interest in the field grow since the semiconductor shortage showed the importance of investing in hardware. “For a long time the focus was on software but this software is also running on necessary hardware” Botros said.

Globally investors are funneling bns of USD into startups that design chips especially for AI-powered applications. In 2021 these startups secured an estimated USD 9.9 bn in VC funding more than triple the total funding for AI chip startups in 2020 according to research from PitchBook Data Inc. picked up by the WSJ.

Brain drain is the biggest challenge facing the local industry the industry figures we talked to agreed. The expansion of the chip sector is a worldwide phenomenon and the demand for Egyptian engineers has increased. The compensation packages offered to engineers by overseas companies are far larger and local firms often can’t compete they said. Egyptian chip design companies offer competitive salaries and other benefits such as stock options but many engineers still opt to travel to countries such as Ireland and Germany El Khouly and Ibrahim said. This increases the cost for local firms who need to restart the hiring process and train new employees due to high turnover.

Nonetheless there’s a lot of optimism for the field going forward especially in light of the government’s focus on digitizing parts of the economy. Egypt’s digital transformation agenda in recent years has seen the government make their services available online increase investments in data centers and upgrade the digital infrastructure to name a few.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine spotlighted the value of semiconductors in the global economy and Taiwan’s crucial role in manufacturing the chips.

They have also showed that the island’s role in producing the crucial components which are used in everything from smartphones to medical devices and cars would be hard to fill.

Taiwan’s vital importance to global supply chains is especially pressing amid growing speculation that China could try to take the self-ruled island which Beijing considers a renegade province by force in the coming years.

Among Taiwan’s manufacturers the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) alone accounts for more than half of global revenue generated by semiconductor foundries thanks largely to a business model that focuses exclusively on manufacturing chips designed by other companies.

Douglas Fuller an expert in technological development at the City University of Hong Kong said Taiwan got a “first-mover advantage” and retained it by recruiting a strong team of engineers – and making sure its education system emphasises engineering – and receiving “a lot of government support” in the form of cheap access to water subsidised loans and low taxes.

Part of how TSMC maintains such support Fuller told Al Jazeera is in the implicit threat that it could move its operations elsewhere.

Taiwan’s role in semiconductor manufacturing is so important that as demand grew with the onset of the pandemic – during which technology kept education and the professional world running – economies including the United States and Germany asked for Taiwan’s help in stepping up production.

Experts have pointed to its semiconductor manufacturing industry as a key factor in Taiwan’s rising stature that helps distinguish the island from China.

Such recognition is crucial for Taiwan which has full diplomatic ties with just 14 states and many countries have been hesitant to deal with Taipei out of fear of angering Beijing in light of its statements that the island must be reunited with the mainland by force if necessary.

Antoine Bondaz research fellow at France’s Fondation pour la Recherche Stratégique says European countries in particular have started speaking about the need for greater cooperation with Taiwan something he attributes to semiconductors specifically. “Semiconductors played a key role in making Taiwan visible” Bondaz told Al Jazeera.

“It’s completely new that Taiwan can be talked about openly.”

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month Taiwan joined the US and its allies in imposing economic penalties on Moscow by playing the highest card in its deck – cutting off semiconductor exports.

The move is likely to leave Russia struggling to find alternatives according to industry experts.

“It’s important to note that semiconductors are not just used for computer processors – they’re required for a range of other functions such as data storage sensing and signal conversion” John Lee director of the East West Futures consulting firm in Germany told Al Jazeera.

“So the potential impact on Russia’s economy is very severe if the current sanctions coalition can be maintained.”

While supply chain disruptions prompted by COVID – not to mention the ongoing great power competition between the US and China – may cause other countries to reevaluate their dependence on Taiwan analysts question whether TSMC can be replaced in the foreseeable future.

South Korea’s Samsung the No. 2 player comes a very distant second in terms of semiconductor foundry revenue. Beyond Samsung United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) also of Taiwan vies with GlobalFoundries of the US for third place.

‘Cannot be surpassed’

Chien-huei Wu an associate research fellow at Academia Sinica in Taipei questioned whether another country could replicate Taiwan’s role pointing to the island’s special institutions for training semiconductor engineers and TSMC’s 24-hour research and development operations.

“This cannot be surpassed even compared to Samsung” Wu said adding that diversification efforts elsewhere would sooner or later run into pitfalls related to energy costs labour costs and the inability to replicate Taiwanese engineers’ efficiency.

Eric Yi-hung Chiou an associate professor of international relations at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taipei concurred.

“It’s not about the money it’s not about the technology” Chiou told Al Jazeera. “It’s about the talent. … working five days a week eight hours a day that will be very difficult. We have more engineers more willing to sacrifice their private time.”

There is one potential threat to TSMC’s position in the market that security analysts are increasingly talking about – the possibility of Beijing launching an invasion of Taiwan.

With Taiwan’s pro-independence President Tsai Ing-wen now in her second term Taiwanese political culture becoming more assertive of its distinct democratic identity and China’s efforts at both cooperation and intimidation falling flat there is growing speculation Beijing may choose to attempt reunification by force.

Most security analysts believe the likelihood of such a scenario is low in the short term but may increase over time.

Beijing has in the meantime sought to claim a greater share of the semiconductor market though Fuller of the City University of Hong Kong for one questions whether or not it will be successful.

Fuller also expressed doubt that it can seize Taiwan’s capacity for semiconductor production by force even if it successfully suppresses Taiwanese resistance: Facilities such as TSMC’s might be destroyed in such an outcome and if not their equipment requires continual servicing including from the US and partner nations.

But Taiwan’s importance in the semiconductor supply chain would not necessarily offer a “silicon shield” should Beijing decide to invade according to Lee.

“Most countries are not going to come to Taiwan’s defence against an attack from China on account of Taiwanese firms’ role in the semiconductor supply chain” he said.

Fuller said semiconductors would be “pretty low down on the priority list for Chinese reasons to attack.”

Such an event would deal a blow to the industry as a whole inflicting a short-term crunch in supply should operations need to shift from Taiwan to another location such as South Korea.

Taiwan’s annexation would likely also raise major questions about regional security – manufacturers would “need to question if moving capacity to Korea is that safe anyway” Fuller said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsbGFib3V0Y2lyY3VpdHMuY29tL25ld3MvMmQtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3RvcnMtbWF5LWJlLWtleS10by0zZC1pbnRlZ3JhdGlvbi1zYXktc3RhbmZvcmQtcmVzZWFyY2hlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2D Semiconductors May Be Key to 3D Integration Say Stanford Researchers - News,"“Finding good metal contacts to semiconductors is a problem as old as semiconductors themselves” said researcher Aravindh Kumar of Stanford University. “With every new semiconductor that is discovered (in our case atomically-thin semiconductors like molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 )) the problem of finding good contacts resurfaces again.”

The problem before Kumar and his fellow researchers Katie Neilson and Kirstin Schauble was finding metal contacts with nearly zero contact resistance (RC). The alternative would be wasted voltage and power at the metal-semiconductor junctions when these materials are integrated into circuits LEDs or solar cells.

To address this challenge these Stanford researchers recently developed a novel technique to make alloyed metal contacts on monolayer 2D semiconductors. The improved metal-semiconductor contact resistance on the 2D semiconductors combined with transition metal dichalcogenides' (TMD) optical properties may pave the way for next-generation logic and memory technologies.

The Promise of 2D-semiconductor Transistors

According to the researchers 2D semiconductors hold promise for solving the problem of channel control in highly-scaled transistors: decreasing the size of the device also decreases the channel length. Interface defects (because of the small size of the transistor gate channel) causes the carrier mobility to degrade.

The researchers say transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoS 2 are preferable materials for sub-10nm channel transistors because of their high mobility at extremely low thickness.

Speaking to All About Circuits the researchers explained the precedence of their latest research:

A previous study in our group showed that metals with high melting points such as nickel (Ni) and palladium (Pd) caused damage when deposited on monolayer MoS 2 . Being a delicate three-atom-thick material this severely degrades its electronic performance. Therefore we and other groups tried metals with low melting points such as indium (In) and tin (Sn) to see if they would reduce damage to MoS 2 . Raman spectroscopy showed that they in fact induce negligible damage on monolayer MoS 2 . In and Sn are very prone to oxidation so we capped these low melting metal contacts with gold (Au) and found that these contacts performed very well.

Electrical Characteristics of Alloy Contacts

To prevent wasted electrical voltage and power the researchers sought out metal contacts with close to no contact resistance (RC). Currently the best-known contacts with the least RC in the market are silver/gold (Ag/Au) gold (Au) and tin (Sn).

The Stanford researchers successfully created In/Au and Sn/Au alloy contacts with a contact resistance as low as 190 ohm.µm and 270 ohm.µm respectively.

“I would say we came up with this alloying technique serendipitously” the team explained. “Then we focused on the alloying aspect because that would ensure both thermal and chemical stability of these contacts. In/Au alloys for example would have a higher melting point than pure In which makes them more industry friendly for any subsequent processing in transistor fabrication.”

Striving for Scalability

The most challenging aspect of the research according to the team was getting these 2D semiconductor transistors to work reliably and reproducibly. “We were not just shooting for one-off ‘hero’ devices—that is single transistors that behaved very well” the researchers noted. “Instead we wanted to demonstrate statistically-relevant improvements in contact resistance across an entire chip. So while we had excellent hero devices in our initial experiments the yield or success rate was low.”

As an example the researchers posited that if they made 100 devices initially only two or three of them would perform well. Over months of trial and error the team tried to nail down a device fabrication process and the testing methodology to ensure they were creating reproducible chip-wide results.

In the early stages of the team's research they could only achieve good electrical performance with transistors at only one to three atom-thick 2D channels. Because 2D TMDs are atomically thin by nature they are grown at low temperatures to avoid melting metals often used for chip interconnects—a contrast to crystalline silicon.

While the researchers concede that silicon is “still the gold standard when it comes to high-performance logic transistors” they expressed optimism about the future of 2D TMD transistors which may be useful for stacking layers of logic and memory on top of the base silicon CMOS layer.

2D Semiconductors: A Key to 3D Integration?

There are many indications that the future of Moore’s law will be driven by stacking transistors in the form of 3D-integrated chips which can mitigate the memory-bandwidth problem or the ""memory wall."" 3D-integrated chips may also revolutionize design and routing methodologies.

2D semiconductors may be a key solution for creating such 3D-integrated chips because they can be readily grown at low temperatures while keeping the electrical properties intact. Because high-resistance contacts have always been a roadblock to adopting 2D semiconductors this research could be groundbreaking for creating good industrial-grade 2D semiconductors on a large scale.

The researchers elaborated “If or when high-quality low-temperature growths can be scaled up to 12” wafers TMDs will play a role in memory and computing layers stacked on top of silicon logic. They could also play a role as access transistors in embedded DRAM in the SRAM cache or as 3D-Flash memory transistors.”

They added “The first two examples benefit from lower off-state currents than are possible with silicon transistors because monolayer TMDs have larger energy band gaps than silicon.”

The Roadmap Ahead for 2D TMDs

In 2019 TSMC announced that it will start manufacturing SiGe as its PMOS channel material for 5nm technology. The research on Ge started around the early 2000s and it took almost 20 years for this study to reach the production units. 2D semiconductor research started around 2011 and has shown tremendous progress since then.

According to the Stanford researchers it is fair to deduce from the Ge timeline that the 2D TMDs may appear in consumer electronics as early as 2030. However some open challenges remain like improving channel mobility and exploring P-type channel candidates. Until these issues are resolved there is serious competition from other new 2D-semiconductor materials.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAyMjA0LzAyL1dTNjI0N2E4YWJhMzEwZmQyYjI5ZTU0Y2RiLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Homegrown auto chips seen as key - Chinadaily.com.cn,"By MA SICHENG YU and LI FUSHENG | China Daily | Updated: 2022-04-02 09:36

More efforts are needed to beef up the development of the auto chip industry in the Chinese mainland as semiconductors become essential to vehicles that are increasingly getting electric connected and smarter experts said on Friday.

Dong Yang co-chairman of the China Automotive Chip Industry Innovation Strategic Alliance an organization dedicated to promoting the development of the homegrown auto semiconductor sector said:""Currently we rely heavily on the import of crucial auto chips. Though the Chinese mainland accounts for more than 30 percent of global sales of cars homegrown companies produce only about 5 percent of the global auto chips.""

According to him it is important to cultivate competitive local auto chip companies that can help carmakers better deal with chip supply challenges and possible export restrictions imposed by other countries amid geopolitical uncertainties.

This week South Korean online news publisher Business Korea cited anonymous sources as saying that the US government proposed setting up a semiconductor industry alliance with its allies including South Korea and Japan to keep the Chinese mainland's fledgling semiconductor industry at bay.

Dong said:""We are striving for a healthier proportion of local chip production so that we can rely on ourselves whenever an emergency arises. Meanwhile we will continue expanding international cooperation given that chips and cars are both highly globalized industries.""

Miao Wei former minister of industry and information technology also said at a conference last week that the auto industry in the Chinese mainland lacks ""chips and souls"" or crucial chips and operating systems especially in vehicle regulation-level components.

Vehicle regulations are requirements that automobiles must satisfy in order to be approved for sale or use in a particular country or region.

""In the past automakers basically ignored the production of chips and (the research and development of) operating systems and left them to suppliers. While our automakers did little foreign automakers have begun to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company a major chipmaker for more production capacity"" he said.

Miao also said the auto industry in the Chinese mainland had gained some momentum in the first half of the ""game"" or in the development of new energy vehicles but the winning hand still lies in the second half of the game which is the development of intelligent connected vehicles.

""We are confident and capable of doing well in the second half of the game so long as more efforts can be made to give full play to our advantages in institutional systems and mechanisms market potential as well as information and communication technologies"" he said.

Roy Lu an independent auto analyst based in Shanghai said local carmakers have shown much interest in latest chips for smart vehicles but they are little involved in the production of micro controller units better known as MCUs that assist automotive applications from motor control to infotainment systems and auto body control.

He explained that MCUs are less profitable and the need for them will become smaller as vehicles are becoming computers on wheels.

""But carmakers cannot get enough chips by pressuring auto parts makers alone. They should at least invest together to scale up capacities. Such investment is necessary for the time being"" Lu said.

Some largest Chinese carmakers have started efforts in that direction already. Gan Jiayue CEO of Geely Auto said the company is optimizing its supply chain by strengthening cooperation with chipmakers.

""In fact we now have set up dialogues with over 130 chipmakers and we are purchasing some chips directly from them"" said Gan."

While Elon Musk held the number one slot Mukesh Ambani is the only Indian to make the top ten.

Billionaires have a disproportionate impact on the world economy politics and philanthropy. According to Forbes there are 2755 billionaires in the world. The wealthiest of them are members of an even more elite club and hold even more power. Many of these billionaires are the founders of technology behemoths with a large portion of their fortune still invested in the firms they founded.

They can however borrow against that wealth to avoid selling stock so deferring (or eliminating for heirs) taxes on unrealized capital gains.

Multi-billionaires can also use a variety of tax breaks to offset reported income resulting in some on this list paying no income tax in recent years.

With so much of their wealth invested in publicly traded assets the richest people’s net worth might change with market prices. For example Elon Musk the creator and CEO of Tesla Inc. (TSLA) and the world’s richest person saw his net worth increase in 2021 due to an increase in the share price of Tesla (of which he now owns 17 percent)—with Tesla shares climbing about 50 percent in 2021.

In comparison Meta Platforms Inc. (FB) founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of the top ten in February 2022 when Meta’s share price plummeted following a dismal financial report. In 2022 Zuckerberg’s net worth will be $40 billion lower.

Production is set to commence in Sydney later this year and will premier on 10 in 2023.

Set in 2000 “Paper Dolls” which is produced by Helium Pictures follows the meteoric rise and fall of fictional girl band Indigo a manufactured pop group born on one of the first reality talent TV shows.

The drama focuses on five women aspiring for pop stardom only to find their dream of fame compromised by what it takes to achieve it. At first competitors and then confidants as Indigo achieves instant success and stardom their secrets threaten to tear the band apart particularly as one member returning to the music industry threatens to implode the group as she seeks revenge on a former record label that wronged her.

“Paper Dolls” is produced by Helium’s Mark Fennessy created and written by Ainslie Clouston (“Amazing Grace” “Playing for Keeps”) and developed with Claire Phillips (“RFDS” “Playing for Keeps”) with Belinda Chapple serving as co-executive producer.

Popular on Variety

Chapple herself was a member of the former girl band Bardot which was created on Australia’s first season of “Popstars” the popular international television reality franchise that set the stage for the explosion of talent shows such as “Pop Idol.”

“‘Paper Dolls” is a deeply fascinating female-driven drama with a female-led creative team. This dramatic and compelling series is defined by its unique mix of fun and edge – equal parts gritty and aspirational” said Fennessy who founded Helium last year.

The company’s initial slate also includes for Paramount Plus drama series “Last King of the Cross” based on John Ibrahim’s best selling book and starring Ian McShane as well as coming-of-age feature film “6 Festivals.”.

Warner Bros/DC also has something to crow about as The Batman topped $700M worldwide.

Starting with Sony’s Daniel Espinosa-directed foray into its deeper Marvel cannon Morbius sank its fangs into $44.9M in 62 international box office markets. This is slightly higher than expected coming into the session and tops comp Birds Of Prey by 10% in like-for-likes at today’s rates (it’s 10% below Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings). Morbius sucked up $5.5M in IMAX globally including $2.5M from overseas screens.

There were No. 1s in 42 of the debut markets while Sonic came in No. 1 in several where there was overlap. Morbius is an origin story about an obscure character that plays like a vampire movie and one on which Sony kept the budget low at an estimated $75M before P&A.

The Top 5 bows were in the UK ($4.2M) Mexico ($3.8M/+45% on Shang-Chi). France ($3.3M/+34% vs Birds Of Prey) the Middle East ($2.7M) and Korea ($2.6M/+36% vs Birds Of Prey). Still to come are the Netherlands and Hong Kong while a China release has yet to be determined. That market is incredibly soft right now amid widespread cinema closures (Sony’s Hotel Transylvania: Transformania is releasing today grossing about $2M so far though the Qingming Festival is afoot this week).

Paramount

Ahead of his domestic bow Sonic The Hedgehog 2 got off to a fast-breaking early start in about 50% of the film’s overseas footprint. Paramount is delighted with the results which are 2% above the original 2020 movie in like-for-likes. Increases were strong over the weekend with very positive word of mouth and No. 1s in such key markets as the UK ($6.4M/651 locations) France ($5.7M/675) Australia ($2.8M/289) Spain ($2.2M/339) and Germany ($2.1M/553). Sweden Czech Republic Austria Norway Belgium New Zealand Slovakia and South Africa all also saw No. 1 starts.

Based on the video game franchise from Sega the Jeff Fowler-directed sequel held pre-release event screenings for families press and influencers to drive early word of mouth. Paramount also leveraged its parent company’s global synergy reach with multi-market integrations on Nickelodeon and in an effort to expand beyond the family audience to teen and young adult gamers the UK Germany and Australia executed Twitch livestream events with local influencers.

The film is still set for release in Mexico Brazil Italy and Japan among others.

School vacations begin this week in many markets which should ensure a long tail for Sonic and should also benefit Morbius even as offerings widen with Warner Bros’ Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets Of Dumbledore due to begin play in some markets this week.

Also from Warner Bros The Batman winged past $700M this session landing at $710.5M worldwide after an additional $13.4M from 76 offshore markets. The international cume is $361.5M and holds were strong in the fifth frame in some key markets including Germany (-6%) France (-27%) Italy (-28%) and the UK (-29%). The latter leads all play with $50.2M.

Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s The Bad Guys staked out new majors this weekend including the UK where the debut was $3.1M at No. 3 and in line with Encanto. In Australia the gang scored the best animated opening of the pandemic at $1.7M (the film is based on the books by Aussie author Aaron Blabey). Spain continues to lead play with $4.5M to date. In total the frame was $10.5M from 41 markets for a 35% drop. The international cume is now $28.8M with France China Korea and Japan still ahead as well as domestic.

Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello broke up in November of 2021 but they're still thinking about one another. Mendes’ new song “When You're Gone” was inspired by his former relationship as he told Extra’s Katie Krause in an interview to promote the single's music video.

“I wrote this song about a month after Camila and I broke up” said Mendes. “A month later you kind of start having all the memories of things that happened and all the memories of so many amazing things….And I was writing about that.”

Mendes says he's glad he took the time to “process” his split and that he was so candid about the experience discussing it on social media

“I'm really glad I did” he explained. “Because I think that's the only way that you get to you get to connect with people. There's only one way you can connect with actual people in a real way. And that's by being truthful and being vulnerable.”

The songwriter also talked to Cabello about the song saying “Camila and I have always been writers for as long as we've known each other so we understand what that means. And we respect what that means. And there'll always be transparency between us.”

He told Erin Lim of E! News during an episode of Daily Pop that he even gave his ex-girlfriend a preview.

“Camila heard this song months ago so we have a really honest relationship” he said. “I would never really put a song out about her before she would hear it.”

He added “She knows me and I know her and ultimately we both are writers and we both know what it is to make music and what the bigger picture of making art is. We're supportive of that always.”

The Oklahoma City Thunder is a family.

Since relocating to Oklahoma City in the 2008-09 season the Thunder organization has prided itself upon culture building. In the franchises’ 14 seasons they’ve become a staple for success placing a record of 626-481 (.565) birthing two MVPs and fielding a finals appearance in the 2011-12 season. Over a decade removed from their humble beginnings the services of those early members are still being commended.

During the Oklahoma City Thunder’s latest matchup versus the Detroit Pistons a collection of 14 previous Thunder members were recognized in the organization’s inaugural Thunder Legacy Network Weekend.

In the mid-game honors six members from the roster’s original 2008-09 were in attendance: Nick Collison Steven Hill Nenad Krstic Johan Petro Kyle Weaver and Chris Wilcox. Alongside Collison five other members of the roster’s finals team as Cole Aldrich Daequan Cook Lazar Hayward Nazr Mohammed and Eric Maynor were at the Paycom Center. Former G League breakouts Mustafa Shakur and Reggie Williams accepted their invite while Mike Wilks rounded out the lineup of former members.

This collection of attendees spans from Oklahoma City’s lone man in the rafters Nick Collison to Steven Hill – a center out of Arkansas who played two minutes in a Thunder jersey.

Addressing the collection of ex-Thunder members Thunder GM Sam Presti showed his appreciation for their time in Oklahoma City. “This is a place where you can come back to you’ll be appreciated you’ll be respected” said Presti. “No matter if you played here for one year or ten or finish your entire career here.”

Outside of attending last night’s game the legacy members partook in a basketball clinic Saturday with Big Brothers Big Sisters a non-profit youth organization.

The Thunder Legacy Network founded in 2020 hopes to shift OKC Legacy Weekend into an annual in-person event moving forward.

Pokusevski spotted the oncoming dousing out of the corner of his eye but it was too late.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Lu Dort Darius Bazley Josh Giddey and Aaron Wiggins jumped Pokusevski and showered him with cups of water.

“I mean I don’t know what to say” Pokusevski told Gallo. “That’s a team.”

Pokusevski deserved the celebration.

He notched his first NBA triple-double — 17 points 12 assists and 10 rebounds — in the Thunder’s 117-96 win over the Suns on Sunday night at Paycom Center.

Poku became the seventh player in Thunder history to record a triple-double. And at 20 years and 98 days old Pokusevski became the 12th-youngest player in NBA history to have a triple-double. His teammate Giddey became the youngest earlier this season.

“That’s a nice personal accomplishment” Pokusevski said “but that wouldn’t matter if we didn’t win.”

Pokusevski got off to a dreadful start which certainly didn’t foreshadow his splendid finish.

In the first half Poku was a team-worst minus-17. He had three points three assists two rebounds and five turnovers. He shot 1-of-5 from the floor.

In the second half Poku was a team-best plus-19. He scored 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting and he had nine assists and eight rebounds.

“The first half wasn’t the best for me” Pokusevski said. “I was thinking what should I do better and I was just being more aggressive in the second half.”

Pokusevski played 36 minutes in the victory and a good chunk of his playing time came at point guard.

Just a friendly reminder that he’s 7-feet tall.

“I mean he’s one of a kind” Thunder center Olivier Sarr said. “He’s as tall as me and can really see over the defense find the open guy great IQ really unselfish pushing on the break. That’s all we need. He’s an unbelievable talent and he had a great night.”

Theo Maledon is the Thunder’s primary point guard right now but with so many other guards out Pokusevski is one of the next-best options.

“He was playing point guard on offense but he’s also guarding perimeter players that are going to be playing deep into the playoffs this year” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “Obviously a really good showing for him.”

Here are four more takeaways:

Sarr steps outside

When Sarr converted a four-point play early in the fourth quarter you pretty much knew the game was over.

Just about everything was falling for the rookie Frenchman.

“Being a big you’re jealous when the guards have four-point plays all the time” Sarr said with a smile. “It felt great.”

Sarr shot 5-of-6 from 3-point range and 9-of-12 overall in his 22 minutes off the bench.

It’s a tiny sample but he’s shooting 13-of-27 (48%) from 3-point range this season.

Sarr is playing on a two-way contract and he’s trying to establish himself as an NBA player.

“Every night is a job interview for me” Sarr said.

As a team the Thunder shot 17-of-41 (42%) from 3-point range. The Suns were just 7-of-38 (18%).

That gap decided the game.

'We’re like brothers':Jaylen Hoard joins Thunder before loss to Pistons adds to OKC's French connection

CP3 returns to OKC

Daigneault’s first impression when he met Chris Paul?

“I couldn’t believe how small he was” Daigneault said. “Usually when you see the great players you can’t believe how big they are. When you first see LeBron James up close you’re like ‘Oh my god this guy’s the smartest player in the league and he’s that big?

“The fact that (Paul) has dominated the league for the time that he has at that size speaks to his intelligence his skill and then his toughness.”

Paul played in front of the Thunder’s home crowd Sunday night for the first time since being traded to Phoenix 16 months ago.

Fans weren’t allowed at Paycom Center last season and Paul didn’t play in the Suns’ first trip to Oklahoma City this season.

Paul is just two seasons removed from playing for the Thunder but Isaiah Roby was the only Thunder player suited up who was a teammate of Paul’s. Gilgeous-Alexander Dort Bazley and Mike Muscala are the other holdovers from the 2019-20 team but all are out for the rest of the season.

Bazley and Muscala greeted Paul with hugs before the game.

Bazley was a rookie in Paul’s lone season with the Thunder. Paul mentored Bazley.

“(Bazley) might have thought his rookie year that every team had a guy like that” Daigneault said. “The longer (Bazley) plays the more he’s going to understand that that’s pretty unique.”

Paul had a quiet night with 11 points and nine assists in his 30 minutes.

NBA draft lottery outlook

After the Pistons beat the Pacers on Sunday the Thunder rose to third from the bottom in the lottery standings.

That lasted all of a few hours as the Thunder turned around and stunned the Suns.

OKC shot the ball well and played tough defense but Phoenix wasn’t exactly playing to its usual standards.

Three Phoenix starters were resting: Deandre Ayton Jae Crowder and star shooting guard Devin Booker.

The Suns still had the far superior team but they don’t have much to play for having already locked up the No. 1 seed in the West.

The Thunder doesn’t have much to play for either but it does have eight guys who are fighting to stay in the NBA.

In meaningless April games that alone can swing a result.

Looking at the lottery standings Orlando and Houston comfortably occupy the bottom-two spots and it looks like OKC and Detroit are going to be jockeying for the third spot.

The Pistons (23-56) have won three games in a row one of which was against the Thunder (23-55). Half a game separates the two teams with only a week to play.

The difference between third and fourth in the reverse standings? Third has a 14% chance at the No. 1 pick. Fourth has a 12.5% chance.

The team that finishes fourth from the bottom can fall to eighth on lottery night while the team that finishes third can fall no lower than seventh.

Injury update

Gilgeous-Alexander Dort Bazley Giddey Muscala Derrick Favors and Ty Jerome are all out for the season.

Kenrich Williams is officially doubtful to return but he’s almost certainly done.

Tre Mann might be the next addition to the list with only four games to play. Mann has missed the Thunder’s last four games with a right hamstring strain and Daigneault didn’t sound confident that Mann will return this season.

“We’re working through it” Daigneault said before the game.

OKC had nine players available Sunday night which was one above the minimum.

Jaylen Hoard who signed a 10-day contract with the team will remain on the roster through the end of the season.",,,,,,

The Wildcatz (18-5-3 8-1-1) winner of the Pacific Coast Athletic League’s Gabilan Division beat Branham of San Jose 2-1 on Feb. 25 for the CCS Open Division title — the highest level in the CCS playoffs. They did so in front of 1000-plus fans at Del Mar High in San Jose.

They also won a pair of CIF NorCal Regional Division I games before falling to No. 1 seed Whitney in the championship match and finished ranked No. 15 in the state by maxpreps.com.

The MLS franchise began its tradition of honoring CCS and North Coast Section champions when PayPal Park opened in 2015. It was the second time the Wildcatz a 12-time section champion have been honored at PayPal Park and the program’s first time since 2016. They’ve previously been honored at Santa Clara University’s Buck Shaw Stadium.

“It means a lot” said forward Mateo Arias one of the Wildcatz’s senior standouts this season. “I’m having fun watching this game and spending time with everybody. It was a good experience walking on the field though. That was my first time ever on a professional field so that feels really good being appreciated by everybody here.”

A total of 18 section champions were invited to participate in the ceremony. Boys champions De La Salle (NCS D-I) Redwood (NCS D-II) Piedmont (NCS D-IV) and King City (CCS D-IV and NorCal D-V) and girls champions Los Altos (CCS D-I) and Salinas (CCS D-IV) were also part of the festivities.

While the majority of the teams were dressed casually the majority of Wildcatz took to the pitch wearing their jersey tops with “Watsonville” proudly emblazoned across their chests.

“Watsonville with all the support they gave they deserved to be put it on the map and recognized. That’s what we did” said Lombardo Flores who will attempt to play for San Jose State next season.

Watsonville’s players were into the game pulling for the Earthquakes and favorite player forward Cade Cowell an 18-year-old from Ceres.

Arias and Lombardo said that some of the things the Wildcatz try to do in competition played out on the field Saturday — but with higher execution and more speed. “They’re way quicker on everything” Arias said. “Being on that level that’s crazy. Their touching is crazy.”

Austin jumped out to a 2-0 lead on Maxi Urruti’s brilliant finish in the 11th minute and Sebastián Driussi’s penalty kick in the 52nd minute.

Jeremy Ebobisse got the ‘Quakes on the board with his penalty kick in the 70th minute and Cowell knotted up the score when he blasted in a loose ball in the 72nd minute for his first goal of the season.

“He’s like our age so he’d doing really great” said Arias before Cowell scored.

Many of the Wildcatz have dreams of playing professionally. Hedgepeth said it was awesome for his players to see this level up close.

“I think most of them have that goal” the coach said. “And you don’t want to take that away from them.”

The UK's Action Fraud body has revealed a new email phishing scam using the Norton brand in order to steal money and personal information from victims.

Action Fraud says it received 110 reports in just seven days relating to fake emails purporting to come from Norton showing the scale of the threat involved.

Fake Norton antivirus scam

In a tweet Action Fraud said that the fake emails claim the victim's antivirus subscription has either expired or is due for renewal.

Victims are urged to contact a fake support team in order to cancel the non-existent subscription but the contact number included is a scam with operators who will look to extract personal or financial information. The emails also often contain fake website links where victims will again be targeted for their valuable information which could lead to bank accounts being drained.

The emails sport official Norton branding and often even have an email sender address starting with the company's name but are purely malicious in intent.

Action Fraud says that if you receive a suspicious email you can report it by forwarding the email to report@phishing.gov.uk. It emphasises that your bank or other official organisations won't ever ask you to share personal information over email or text which can be spoofed or intercepted. If you have concerns over a suspicious message or request it's always best to contact the organisation directly.

Email phishing campaigns are a sadly common feature for many online users with criminals often hijacking the logo and branding of famous companies to try and trick people into exposing their information.

Most recently scammers looked to utilise PayPal branding to steal from victims setting up a landing page that looks almost identical to the PayPal login page whilst also creating an email that mimics the looks and the feels of a newsletter notification email or warning from the company.

However this email contains a link that instead of taking the victim towards the actual PayPal login page instead leads them to fake landing page where if they’re gullible they’ll give away their passwords to the attackers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGFjdXRlLmNvbS95b3V0dWJlLXRoZS1oaXN0b3J5LWFuZC1vcmlnaW5zLW9mLXRoZS12aWRlby1zaGFyaW5nLXdlYnNpdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,YouTube: The History and Origins of the Video Sharing Website,"Share this post save 6

This is because the North Korean government does not want its citizens to have access to any information that is not approved by the government. The platform is also blocked in a few other countries including Iran and Saudi Arabia and a few others.

He will replace Glen Walter who has been in the role since October 2017 and is leaving the company to become chief executive officer of the Tropicana Brands Group Chicago.

Mr. Valle was most recently executive vice president of Latin America for Mondelez. In his new role he will be responsible for the company’s $8.3 billion business in the United States and Canada.

“With more than three decades of experience in consumer-packaged goods and a strong track record of success growing brands and categories in the US and beyond Gustavo is an ideal leader to set our North America business on the path for future success” said Dirk Van de Put chairman and CEO. “I’ve worked very closely with Gustavo for many years and have seen his passion for consumers and operational excellence first-hand.”

Mr. Walter takes the helm of the recently formed Tropicana Brands Group which is a joint venture between PAI Partners and PepsiCo Inc. Purchase NY. The JV was formed when PAI completed the acquisition of a majority stake in PepsiCo’s juice business in January for $3.3 billion. PepsiCo retains a 39% stake in the business.

The business includes such beverage brands as Tropicana Naked Kevita Izze and others.

“We are excited to welcome Glen as CEO of Tropicana Brands Group” said Frédéric Stévenin a managing partner at PAI. “He is joining an already exceptional leadership team following a rigorous selection process. Tropicana Brands Group is a great addition to our portfolio as we believe there is strong potential for innovation in the growing fresh natural category and look forward to overseeing this growth alongside PepsiCo.”

PAI Partners is a private equity company that has approximately €15 billion ($17.8 billion) under its control. In 2016 PAI through its R&R ice cream company set up a joint venture with Nestle SA Vevey Switzerland called Froneri. The business combined Nestle and R&R’s ice cream businesses and included Nestle’s European frozen food business (excluding pizza and retail frozen food in Italy) as well as a chilled dairy business in the Philippines and had approximately $2.8 billion in sales.

In 2019 Nestle sold its US ice cream business to Froneri for $4 billion. The transaction made Froneri the second largest ice cream manufacturer in the world according to the company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbmRpYS9hcy13ZS10aGluay1vZi1mdXR1cmUtb2Ytd29yay1zdGFydC13aXRoLWZhbWlseS10aGVuLXdvcmstb3V0d2FyZHMtaW5kcmEtbm9veWktNzg0ODcwOS_SAYQBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2luZGlhL2FzLXdlLXRoaW5rLW9mLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi13b3JrLXN0YXJ0LXdpdGgtZmFtaWx5LXRoZW4td29yay1vdXR3YXJkcy1pbmRyYS1ub295aS03ODQ4NzA5L2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indra Nooyi: ‘As we think of future of work start with family then work outwards’,"On steering clear of a larger-than-life image

Leadership is a tough assignment and as you ascend to the top life is very difficult. If you try to craft an image that is not authentic that veneer will slip very often and people will see through you. So one of the things that I decided was that I’m not going to create a new veneer. Trying to juggle the priorities of work family and kids is just not easy. So I’m going to tell people how hard it is. I’m going to use a support system to help me manage all of this stuff. And things are going to fall through the cracks. But if I’m human and talk about it honestly then I don’t have to constantly think about what image I should create for myself.

On finding empathy

The empathy part was simple because all the people who worked for me and worked with me were first of all human beings who had their own families their own communities their issues which they couldn’t just leave behind. It never affected their work but you could feel it in their body language. They were emotional about certain issues. And I felt that if I reached out to them and understood them as people as opposed to tools of the trade they would give me more in terms of contribution to the workplace. So I got to know them as people.

On taking strong political positions

One of the reasons why people want corporate leaders to take a position is that they feel helpless. So they think that corporations can actually convince governments to do something different. Now here’s the problem. In a corporation whatever position I took one third of the employees agreed one third disagreed and one third were quiet. There was always this dilemma. What about the quiet group? If something violated the value statement or code of conduct we always took a position. If it did not relate to it we stayed out.

On her American story

The US is still the most open country in the world. In my book I talked about being in the UK with the prime minister at a luncheon and he asked me why I didn’t come to the UK many years ago. And I told him ‘Had I come to the UK I wouldn’t be having lunch with you’. In most countries an Indian immigrant from an emerging market a woman would have a tough time ascending to the CEOship. There’s no way to really work your way up the hierarchy in any country other than the US and get to the top and be accepted. If you look at the number of Indian American CEOs in the US it’s an unprecedented number.

On her ‘performance with purpose’ approach

Advertisement

ESG (Environmental Social and Governance) needs to move from being a lip service from the fringe to the core. When I did ‘performance with purpose’ I didn’t just do it because I thought it was nice to do or as corporate social responsibility. I wanted to de-risk the company because at that time there were a lot of taxes on our ‘fun for you’ products. And I wanted to keep the company growing so I had to shift the portfolio to ‘better for you’… Now fast forward to today. ESG metrics cannot be fringe from the company. I honestly believe a good subset of ESG metrics should drive shareholder value.

On mega global trends

I see five big mega trends which lead to two big issues and three big changes that need to happen. One over the next decade or two you’re going to see much bigger growth in population in Asia and Africa than the rest of the world. But if you look at the GDP it’s going to be mismatched. The second is that when you have so much growth in Asia and Africa you’re also going to have more consumption of protein and therefore more animals that are reared. That could result in more epidemics and pandemics. So we need public health systems that prepare us for epidemics and pandemics. Third climate change is going to impact us massively. The fourth is the ageing of the population. If you have an ageing population and you don’t create support structures for women to work you won’t be able to take care of the ageing population. And finally the dizzying pace at which technology is moving and changing. There are two big issues it raises. First I think we’re going to see a lot more geo-political upheavals because of where the population is growing and where the GDP is. People are going to want to retreat to nation states and national boundaries. And the second is because so much of the growth is going to be in knowledge jobs we’re going to have to do a grand rescaling of talent. And then it raises worrisome issues. Do regulators worldwide know how to regulate technology? Second in a world which could become more unequal what’s the role of capitalism? And finally if technology is going to overtake so much of our life

how are we going to put the human back in humanity?

On the gender gap in India

You’re seeing the rise of female talent and that has to be put to use for the country. How do you really take advantage of all of the talent not just a portion of the talent? I think women are part of that. Where it gets a little confusing is that as we look at the laws in the books India has the best laws and support for women but somehow in the implementation of the laws there are problems. I’m glad that the Prime Minister is talking to women. But I think it’s not just asking women to vote it’s also worrying about the issues that keep women unsafe. There’s also the question of talking to the men about how women should be treated in society. It’s not just about women talking to women it’s men in power and all men coming to the table and saying what needs to change.

On the unevenness of the Indian education system

Advertisement

The top education institutions are fantastic. And after that the fall off is pretty spectacular. So I think the focus has got to be on taking everything other than the top five per cent of institutions and figuring out how to improve the quality of the education that they impart to students… India has to really think about how to upgrade the entire education system and build it off what they’ve done with the top institutions.

On war and economic sanctions

This is an unprecedented time where most Western companies have come together to explore economic sanctions as a way to hopefully stop this terrible war. So let’s just say that after every major skirmish or war we find new behaviours and new ways of averting a war which may or may not succeed.

On bringing up her daughters

With my first daughter I put all kinds of restrictions — you can’t wear this and on weekends you have to be home by seven. It was not sensible for me to do that because she was in a different society. When I had my second daughter I changed how I interacted with both kids. So my first daughter will always say that her younger sister had the benefit of all the stuff that she didn’t because I learned over time that when in Rome do as the Romans do. So what I’ve tried to do is judiciously balance what I thought were child-rearing disciplines give up some and try to modify and moderate to come up with a new style.

On the definition of an ideal worker

The ideal worker was a nine-to-five job the male breadwinner and then the woman stayed home and kept things going. That existed for a long time. Families are fragile and messy. When something goes wrong what is that woman supposed to do? How was she supposed to take care of the family? So from a practical perspective we have to rethink the ideal worker. And my hope is that as we think about the future of work we put families in the centre and say how can we design the future of work that says parents need to give time to building and nurturing families as well as engaging in paid work? How do we engineer flexibility into the work day or the place of work to enable this blend of work and family to happen? I’m not suggesting lowering the productivity standards in companies. Neither am I saying you just give half your attention to the kids. I’m just saying that between the husband and wife there’s got to be a judicious balance of the two. So my hope is as we think post-Covid as to what the future of work should be start with where’s family in the future of work and then work outwards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vbmV3cy9idXp6L3BlcHNpLWluLXNvdXAtYW1pZC10ZXhhcy1hYm9ydGlvbi1yb3ctYnV0LWJveWNvdHQtY2FsbHMtYXJlbnQtbmV3LWZvci10aGUtYnJhbmQtNDcwNzMyMC5odG1s0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvYnV6ei9wZXBzaS1pbi1zb3VwLWFtaWQtdGV4YXMtYWJvcnRpb24tcm93LWJ1dC1ib3ljb3R0LWNhbGxzLWFyZW50LW5ldy1mb3ItdGhlLWJyYW5kLTQ3MDczMjAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BuzzFix: Pepsi in Soup Amid Texas Abortion Row. But Boycott Calls Aren't New for the Brand,"Last year the US state of Texas adopted a law that disallowed abortion after the foetus is in the sixth week of pregnancy when normally in most pregnancy cases the heartbeat becomes detectable. Pro-choice activists have made a vehement stand against it saying the law gives an ultimatum to women when in most cases they do not even have an idea of their pregnancies at that juncture. The law also termed as SB Act (Senate Bill) Heartbeat Act defies the precedent created by the US Supreme Court that says that abortion is allowed before foetal viability which happens usually between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy.

But what has Pepsi got to do with it?

WHY IS PEPSI FACING IRE ONLINE?

The snack and beverage corporation found itself at the receiving end of social media ire and threats of boycott from all over US after the company’s name was found in a report that mentioned top corporate donations made to political parties. The report by newsletter Popular Information included PepsiCo as one of the donors who gave $15000 to the Texas Republican Party after the bill banning abortions was brought and signed as law in the state.

The report said that Pepsi kept donating to the Texas GOP after the ‘heartbeat bill’ was brought in even though they kept promoting a message to “empowering women in the workplace marketplace and community” Newsweek reported.

WRITERS POLITICIANS JOIN IN

Hashtag #BoycottPepsi started trending on US Twitter after the report emerged with many prominent faces also coming out in support of the boycott of the soft drink brand. Writer E Jean Carroll tweeted “Need ANOTHER reason to stop drinking Pepsi? @PepsiCo sent a big fat check to the GOP legislators who got the TEXAS ABORTION BILL passed.”

Totally agree Pepsi and other companies. Americans needs to send messages to contributors and elected officials voting and boycotts will send clear msgs.— Mary Martin Blackmon (@MaryBla62964006) January 26 2022

Melanie D’Arrigo a Democrat running for Congress in New York explained it in a tweet as well “One more time louder for the people in the back: Corporations are not people and they are not our friends. Nothing that has ever furthered our rights or helped working families started with a corporate lobbyist cutting a check. #BoycottPepsi.”

WHAT DOES PEPSI SAY?

Pepsi however has clarified that the timing of the donation has caused some confusion. The Independent quoted a spokesperson as saying “During presidential election years PepsiCo has typically made donations supporting both the Democratic and Republican conventions in several states. In the summer of 2020 we donated to both the Democratic and Republican parties in Texas to support those state conventions” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson added that due to the check not being processed until August last year the donation wasn’t recorded before that. They also said no donations to the Texas state political party were made since 2020 and called any report saying so as false.

NOT The FIRST TIME

This however isn’t the first time the beverage giant has faced boycotts from states or countries. Closer home in India the brand found itself in trouble back in the early 2000s when Kerala Tamil Nadu decided to ban the sale of Pepsi and Coca-Cola at schools and colleges after reports said many samples of drinks sold by the beverage companies were found having pesticides in them.

“There are lots of reports which prove that these drinks have certain ingredients that are harmful to the human body” the then-Kerala CM VS Achuthanandan had said.

The Center for Science and Environment in New Delhi had at that time said they found pesticide residues in samples of Pepsi and Coca-Cola that were several notches above the limits set by the Indian regulatory authorities.

The centre had said tests on 57 samples taken from 11 soft drink brands made by Coca-Cola India and PepsiCo India had found to contain a ‘cocktail of 3 to 5 different pesticides’ which seems to have entered the drinks through the groundwater used in making them an Al Jazeera report had said.

Following the ban by the southern states 5-6 more Indian states had also temporarily banned the sale of the beverages.

In 2017 traders in Tamil Nadu had again sought to ban the sale of Pepsi and Coca-Cola and advocated local products. The state’s top two trading associations had alleged that the soft drink companies take too much water from rivers which leaves farmers struggling to irrigate their land.

The same year the beverage giant had to also roll back an advertisement that featured supermodel Kendall Jenner after they faced accusations of trivializing protest movements. The advertisement showed Jenner stepping away from a modeling shoot to join a crowd of young protesters. The group cheer after the former gives a can of Pepsi to a cop who drinks from the can.

Pepsi had released a statement where it said “Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity peace and understanding. Clearly we missed the mark and we apologize.”

BY MTHANDAZO NYONI

ZIMBABWE’S fastest growing beverages maker Varun Beverages says it plans to grow its domestic operation into a group of companies worth US$500 million as it responds to growing demand for its soft drink brands.

The strategy announced by chief executive officer (CEO) Vijay Kumar Bahl last week gives the business impetus to extend its growing influence in the southern African country where it has shaken the status quo within four years.

Varun produces a range of soft drink brands under the PepsiCo franchise in Zimbabwe and is majority controlled by billionaire Indian tycoon Ravi Jaipuria.

Bahl who spoke during the Zimbabwe-Rwanda investment conference in Harare said Varun had so far injected about US$80 million into modern beverage production technologies and exponential demand along with an improved investment climate had given it confidence to inject more resources.

Varun came onto the scene during the period of dramatic political transition in Zimbabwe with President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administration making serious investment policy shifts under the ‘Zimbabwe is Open for Business’ mantra after assuming office in 2017.

The Varun CEO said his expansion strategy was testimony to the changes.

The firm’s first locally produced products came into the market in February 2018.

“As an Indian investor I can tell all of you from my own experience that Zimbabwe’s ‘Open for Business’ (mantra) is not just a dialogue” Kumar Bahl said.

“It is a reality and as an Indian investor CEO and shareholder I can tell you that this US$75 million to US$80 million (that we have invested) is just a start of business here. We have a vision to create a group of companies in Zimbabwe. This should not be less than US$500 million” the Varun CEO said.

Varun’s aggressive market penetration pricing has been credited for maintaining beverage prices fairly stable in Zimbabwe where a decades — long monopolies priced as they saw fit.

The 7UP and Mirinda brands maker has been leveraging on its special economic zone (SEZ) designation to expand the business.

Firms licensed by SEZ enjoy a string of benefits that help them manage costs.

The company’s SEZ designation is set to expire next year in February.

“We started in Zimbabwe with one production line and a production of 12 million bottles per month. Today we have seven production lines. Four production lines and three backward integration. So in four years’ time (we have expanded) from one production line to seven production lines” he said.

“We are very happy working here. When we had one production line the total capacity that we had was 12 million bottles in a month. Today with seven production lines we have capacity to produce 58 million bottles and cans in a month. We have three preform manufacturing machines” he said.

The firm is currently investing US$20 million for additional lines which will be launched by President Emmerson Mnangagwa “very soon”.

“We are setting up two more production lines to take the total production capacity to 76 million bottles and cans per month” he said.

Bahl said the firm had also set up a plastic ware plant.

The billionaire flew into Harare in October last year to commission new production assets after which he indicated that more resources were on the way.

“We want to expand into juices” said Jaipuria who spoke to Standardbusiness after the commissioning.

“But as you can see there is no more space left. We want to do more backward integration and we are running out of capacity here. As I said we are going to put up a juice line and we would require land for that. It depends with how fast government it going to give us land. We have already announced between US$10 million and US$15 million investment for next year (2022). I think by the end of 2023 we will be able to do what we are saying” Jaipuria said."

He Also Says He Invented Some.,"MADISON Va. — “I haven’t been able to ride a horse in months” Dr. Robert Malone said from his 50-acre horse farm about two hours southwest of Washington. “It’s just a constant barrage of requests for assistance.”

Dr. Malone 62 was sitting barefoot at his kitchen table wearing a navy tie decorated with dark red spikes of the coronavirus in the middle of another busy day of appearances on conservative television shows and podcasts. Just that week he had appeared on “Hannity” a hit on Fox News that averages over three million viewers and on One America News. He joined “Candace” an online talk show hosted by the right-wing media personality Candace Owens. And he was a guest on the podcasts “America First With Sebastian Gorka” and “The Joe Pags Show.”

Dr. Malone spent decades working in academic centers and with start-ups seeking to bring new medical treatments to market and to combat the Zika and Ebola outbreaks. But in recent months as the coronavirus pandemic has persisted he has taken up an entirely different role: spreading misinformation about the virus and vaccines on conservative programs.

In many of his appearances Dr. Malone questions the severity of the coronavirus which has now killed nearly one million people in the United States and the safety of the coronavirus vaccines which have been widely found to be safe and effective at preventing serious illness and death. His statements in late December on “The Joe Rogan Experience” one of the most popular podcasts in the country with 11 million listeners per episode on average were at the center of the uproar over Mr. Rogan’s role in spreading bad information about the virus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jdXJldXMuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzkwMzExLWNhc2Utc2VyaWVzLW9mLXRocmVlLW5ldXJvbG9naWNhbC1zaWRlLWVmZmVjdHMtaW4teW91bmdlci1hZ2VkLWluZGl2aWR1YWxzLWFmdGVyLXBmaXplcnMtbXJuYS12YWNjaW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Case Series of Three Neurological Side Effects in Younger-Aged Individuals After Pfizer's mRNA Vaccine,"Please choose I'm not a medical professional.

Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome is the fatal late-stage complication from untreated Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection which attacks the immune system over time.

Tenpenny – who was banned from Twitter last summer for peddling vaccine misinformation – cited a debunked Exposé story that circulated earlier this year on Facebook which claimed that the German government had conducted a study that determined that coronavirus inoculations lead to AIDS. It did not.

This was not the first time that Tenpenny a licensed osteopathic physician from Cleveland Ohio has promoted such a bizarre conspiracy theory. In January Tenpenny asserted that coronavirus vaccines ""are creating 'quantum entanglement' between those who take them and 'the Google credit scores and the dematrix and all of those things.'""

She was also busted a year ago for teaching an online ""COVID-19 conspiracy 'boot camp'"" on ""how to target vaccine-hesitant"" people as well as the ""potential hacking of vaccine passports"" according to a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation report.

Nevertheless there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause AIDS. But that has not stopped Tenpenny from promulgating the lie.

""The more shots you get the more – the more you destroy your immune system and the faster that happens. And it's anticipated the German data says that by the end of 2022 every fully vaccinated person over the age of 30 may have the equivalent of full-blown vaccine-induced immune-suppressed AIDS"" said Tenpenny who in November admitted to traveling on airplanes while displaying COVID-19 symptoms."

Point guard Deivon Smith is transferring to St. John's from Utah giving Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino a veteran replacement for Daniss Jenkins next season.

A fifth-year senior Smith ranked sixth in the country with 7.1 assists per game last season. He averaged 13.3 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Utes compiling five triple-doubles -- second most during a single season in NCAA history and the most by any Pac-12 player.

In a St. John's news release Monday Pitino said the 6-foot Smith reminds him of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier a standout player for Pitino at Louisville.

""Super excited to have Deivon Smith joining the Johnnies"" Pitino said. ""Total dog who rebounds creates and scores.""

Smith from Decatur Georgia played his freshman season at Mississippi State and then spent two years with Georgia Tech. He shot a career-high 46.7% from the field in 28 games during his only season at Utah.

Two of his triple-doubles came during Utah's run to the NIT semifinals and he scored a career-best 28 points against tournament runner-up Indiana State on April 2.

Smith becomes the third notable transfer the Red Storm have landed this offseason joining 7-foot-1 center Vincent Iwuchukwu from USC and 6-foot-7 forward Aaron Scott from North Texas. They both committed last month.

At point guard St. John's also returns sophomore Simeon Wilcher a touted recruit who began to show marked improvement late last season in his limited role as a freshman. Wilcher averaged 2.8 points and 9.1 minutes in 28 games as Jenkins' understudy.

Jenkins followed Pitino from Iona to St. John's for his senior season and propelled the Red Storm to a 20-13 record including 11-9 in conference play for their most Big East wins in 14 years. They reached the Big East tournament semifinals for the first time since 2000 losing 95-90 to eventual NCAA champion UConn.

Jenkins led the team in scoring (14.9 points per game) assists (5.4) steals (1.6) and minutes (30.7) earning second-team All-Big East honors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uYmEvamF6ei9uZXdzL2VuZC1zZWFzb24tZ3JhZGVzLWV2YWx1YXRpbmctamF6ei1rZXlvbnRlLWdlb3JnZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,End of Season Grades: Evaluating Jazz PG Keyonte George,"Despite the Utah Jazz going just 31-51 on the year there were plenty of memorable and enjoyable pieces to the season. One of the brightest was Keyonte George the rookie out of Baylor who burst onto the scene from day one and seized the Jazz starting point guard role.

It’s hard to expect any more from the 20-year-old who was taken with the 16th pick in last summer's draft. George averaged 13.0 points 4.4 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game for the Jazz. Those numbers were good for fourth in scoring and second in total assists amongst all rookies this year. The passing in particular was a lot better than advertised after not being asked to do much of that while at Baylor.

George’s scoring remains the most intriguing piece of his game. He recorded three games in which he scored over 30 points and went over 20 points in nine others. When he’s playing confidently he can get buckets from all three levels and has plenty of juice from long-range. On February 15 George etched his name into the record books when he knocked down nine three-pointers which tied him for the rookie record and put him all alone for Jazz rookies.

An underrated storyline from the season was the leadership role the rookie took on as the season progressed. Jazz head coach Will Hardy thrust him into the starting point guard role early on and along with this came added responsibility- a responsibility that George seemed comfortable with. Heading into his first full offseason George will have even more of an opportunity to be a leader for this Jazz team that is looking to improve.

Despite all the positives it wasn’t a perfect season for George. He like the Jazz's other guards struggled with efficiency. There was a point in the middle of March where George seemed to have figured out how to get to his spots and score more efficiently but those numbers dipped as his teammates missed games and his name became more prominent on opposing scouting reports. Judging by his end-of-season comments he’s not worried about the misses. George said getting stronger and in better shape would result in the shots falling at a higher clip.

Defensively George is still a work in progress. Although his length stands out there's still plenty of room to grow. He has enough size to play either backcourt position which he used to showcase some nice individual defensive sequences. His off-ball awareness needs to improve as does his general focus on that end but he certainly has the potential to be a fine defender in this league.

One area where George can improve is in his words emotional intelligence. He’s immensely talented but he needs to keep his head up when he misses a shot or makes a silly turnover. He’s young though and there’s so much good that it’s hard to dwell on the bad.

Overall it was a very promising season for George. He’ll head into a big offseason with a lot to learn but a great foundation of skills & intelligence to build on. In a postgame press conference Hardy said that Keyonte could become the future of the Jazz program. That is high praise from his head coach but it is certainly a quote that should make you feel good as a Jazz fan.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRydW0uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9zdGV2ZS1tY3F1ZWVuLWRpcmVjdHMtMTJtLXBnLXRpcHMtdHYtcmV0dXJuLXN0YXJyaW5nLWFzaGxleS13YWx0ZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steve McQueen directs £12m PG Tips TV return starring Ashley Walters,"After an eight-year hiatus the brand is back with a hefty investment a new agency in London indie shop Calling and a determination to make tea cooler than coffee.

PG Tips has long been a household staple in Britain. Initially celebrated for its memorable advertising campaigns featuring its iconic monkeys and renowned comedians like Peter Sellers Bob Monkhouse and Johnny Vegas the tea brand gradually lost its resonance with modern audiences.

Around a decade ago it fell into severe neglect. The monkeys were retired the brand ambassadors appeared outdated and its parent company Unilever significantly reduced its advertising investments.

Today it’s back on TV screens for the first time in eight years with a new brand campaign aptly titled ‘It’s Not Just Tea. It’s Progress’. For its huge return PG Tips has enlisted legendary director Steve McQueen with Top Boy actor and acclaimed musician Ashley Walters in front of the camera to excite a nation of tea drinkers. It’s the brainchild of indie agency Calling which is making a name for itself by modernizing heritage brands.

“We separated the tea business from Unilever just under two years ago” explains Karen Owen global senior marketing executive at Lipton Teas and Infusions. “PG Tips hasn’t really been invested in for many many years. So we said no this is the nation’s tea. It is the nation’s favorite tea.”

‘Rock Solid’ which is the first ad in this new approach forms part of a £12m marketing push that aims to help PG Tips reclaim a place at the heart of modern British culture as well as connect with a younger demographic of tea drinkers.

Owen continues: “When you look at Gen Z culture there’s a real fear of burnout. They are not interested in coffee because that’s burnout culture; it’s pushing the problem down the road. They are much more about recovery and reconnecting with their self.”

It's an idea that Calling brought to the table in the formative chats with PG Tips. Owen says the initial storyboard had relatively few tweaks and the whole team was beyond excited. “The way we positioned it in our strategy is that tea is recovery not a drug” says Calling co-founder and executive creative director Josh Tenser. “And that felt like a massive unlock for the value system of those younger audiences. And then we were like OK so what is it about recovery that people might want to lean into?”

Tea tends to have lower caffeine levels than coffee. Tenser says that this thought process led them to having a cup of tea while reconnecting and having a conversation with themselves.

What transpired in a powerful 70-second film tells the story of overcoming self-doubt and finding inner courage. In the spot viewers watch as Walters coaches himself out of the doldrums over a cup of PG Tips before inviting the nation to summon their self-belief and positivity too.

Tenser continues: “We wanted to use talent that shows the world what a progressive modern Britain could be like and that’s why Ashley is so great. He’s had ups and downs in life they’re well publicized. He’s a hero to so many people because he isn’t perfect but he’s been very open about his mental health.”

The other aspect that makes Walters such a brilliant choice to bring PG Tips back to the nation is that he connects with many audiences the ones that remember him from his music career and the newer fans that know him from acting in Top Boy.

Tenser says they knew that if they were going to bring back this heritage brand they had to have someone equally iconic behind the camera and that person was Steve McQueen. The 12 Years A Slave director doesn’t do a lot of commercials but apparently this one didn’t take a lot of convincing.

“One of the first comments Steve made when he started talking with us was that tea is the lifeblood of the nation” recalls Owen. “He grew up with PG Tips and he said ‘You know what it’s really important that we write something together that is about creating moments of progress.’ So we showed him the draft storyboard that we had and he came up with some amazing additions.”

It wasn’t like working with a typical commercial director; everyone on the team thought about this as more of a film than an ad. Walters talking directly to the audience through the TV screen feels personal and refreshing.

“It was amazing to work with Steve; he’s a wizard” adds Tenser. “There was just such a deep level of respect between Ashley and Steve that it made the whole thing. They both felt totally invested in each other. A different director talent combo wouldn’t have given you that beautiful comfort that you could feel in the performance.”

The ad is an address to the nation in a way. Gone are the days of the dreary grey day being made slightly better by a cuppa this is people’s moment to take a moment of reflection with themselves rain or shine.

“It’s a real honor to be working with such an iconic British brand and be part of a campaign that encourages taking time out putting the kettle on taking a break and giving ourselves some time to re-calibrate” added Walters. “We’ve all grown up with tea being a big part of our lives marking every occasion from starting the day to a family celebration. For me enjoying a cuppa is a moment to pause re-gather re-energize focus and then press play.”

It’s a long-term play for the brand. Recently there’s been a further £40m investment in new machinery training and blends at its Trafford Park site in Manchester. Owen says aside from traditional media they will be launching this campaign across social platforms too which is a key area for reaching younger audiences that are invested in the rising wellness trends. She believes firmly that tea can play a role in that.

“We’re not looking for everything to be perfect and polished. We want to understand what matters. And that’s how we’ll see the campaign evolve” she concludes.

“We don’t know quite what’s going to happen next but what we do know is it’s going to be about progress. And Steve when I was with him last week he’s said ‘So what are we going to do next?’”"

Experts say the problem isn’t about the safety or efficacy of the vaccine but allowing a tobacco company to profit from it.

This is an excerpt from Second Opinion a weekly health and medical science newsletter. If you haven't subscribed yet you can do that by clicking here.

Canada should have known the World Health Organization likely wouldn't accept Medicago's COVID-19 vaccine over its close ties with tobacco giant Philip Morris — before deciding to invest millions of dollars of taxpayer money in the company.

The WHO told CBC News on March 25 the biopharmaceutical firm's request for emergency use authorization of its Covifenz vaccine had "" not been accepted "" due to the company's ""linkage with the tobacco industry"" and was now ""on hold.""

Marlboro cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris International owns 21 per cent of Medicago shares and the WHO reiterated it has long had a ""strict policy"" on ""not engaging with companies that promote tobacco"" and that Medicago had been informed of the decision.

That leaves Medicago's vaccine in limbo after the federal government gave the company $173 million in 2020 to develop the vaccine build a new production facility and purchase 20 million doses with an option for 56 million more.

Canada has approved the vaccine and is expected to distribute it next month but it's the only country so far and use of the shot worldwide would be severely hampered without WHO approval.

""Medicago now has to face the consequences of their choice"" said Dr. Gaston De Serres a medical epidemiologist at the Quebec National Institute of Public Health (INSPQ).

""It's not something they overlooked. It's a decision they took understanding its implications understanding this would come with big problems when dealing with WHO.""

Medicago knew working with WHO would be 'difficult'

De Serres said the problems Medicago would have had in getting a COVID-19 vaccine with close ties to the tobacco industry approved by the WHO were ""quite obvious"" and that the federal government ""should have known"" this issue would arise before investing in it.

""They wouldn't have to work hard to know that Philip Morris was also an important shareholder"" he said.

""And WHO I think is fully entitled to say tobacco is the largest preventable cause of premature death and we don't want to have anything to do with the tobacco industry.""

Since the beginning of the pandemic there have been over six million confirmed deaths from COVID-19 worldwide. The WHO estimates tobacco kills more than eight million people each year.

Medicago produces its vaccine with the plant species Nicotiana benthamiana a close relative of the tobacco plant that is used for pharmaceutical development — largely because of the high number of viruses that can successfully infect it.

But the WHO's policy on Big Tobacco is no secret and Canada signed the legally binding WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2005 committing to ""protect"" public health policies ""from the commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry.""

A spokesperson for the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) told CBC News the federal government ""studied the matter of its investment in Medicago carefully"" and believes it is still ""compliant with its treaty obligations related to tobacco control"" with the WHO.

But Medicago told Global News last year that it even had trouble getting a ""formal invitation"" to attend WHO meetings and was never able to get in ""through the big door.""

""WHO although they love the product and the technology they have to deal with the fact that we're supported by tobacco"" Nathalie Landry executive vice president of scientific and medical affairs at Medicago said in the January 2021 interview.

""It's difficult for Medicago to be associated with WHO.""

Can tobacco companies 'redeem themselves'?

This also isn't the first time a Canadian health product has faced challenges getting WHO approval over controversial tobacco industry ties.

The experimental Ebola drug ZMapp  which was partially developed in PHAC's National Microbiology Lab faced similar hurdles getting WHO authorization for emergency use during the devastating West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014 before finally getting approved .

""We've seen this problem before with the WHO and it may be that they are going to need to look at this policy that they have around involvement with tobacco"" said Alison Thompson an associate professor of bioethics at the University of Toronto.

""It's not as simple anymore as saying we're not going to get into bed with tobacco or nobody in tobacco should be profiting from this because it's one possible way for tobacco companies to redeem themselves.""

But Dr. Gary Kobinger a Canadian immunologist and virologist at the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas who helped develop Zmapp said investors were similarly hesitant to fund the drug over its ties to the Reynolds American tobacco company.

The solution is to get Philip Morris out of Medicago and if WHO still will not approve the vaccine … then it's going to be an expensive lesson. - Cynthia Callard Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada

""I do understand the policy [the WHO] has in place. We all do. The question is what is the solution?"" he said.

""Can entities that were found guilty of causing so many human deaths be redeemed ? Can they produce live-saving solutions and contribute with or without profit to now save lives?""

Kobinger said he does not believe the tobacco industry is ""essential to vaccine development"" but that if they do get involved in developing new shots they should at least ensure that they can get WHO approval before bringing them to market.

WHO debating tobacco industry investment 'trend'

WHO officials now say they have yet to make a final decision on whether or not to continue reviewing the Medicago vaccine and are holding ongoing talks about how to better address the ""general trend"" of tobacco companies investing in the health industry.

When asked by CBC News during a virtual press conference Wednesday when a final decision on the shot could be made Mariangela Simao WHO's assistant director-general for drug access vaccines and pharmaceuticals said it could be coming soon.

""We're seeing an increasing trend globally of the tobacco industry diversifying their portfolio by engaging with the pharma industry"" she said.

""So this process is still on hold but we should have a decision on the continuation or not of the process in the next few weeks.""

Quebec's Medicago COVID-19 vaccine faces WHO rejection over company's tobacco ties Duration 5:08 Canada Tonight medical contributor Dr. Samir Gupta speaks with Ginella Massa about Quebec's Medicago COVID-19 vaccine facing rejection from the WHO and what it means for Canadians.

'Throw away' technology due to tobacco ties?

Alyson Kelvin a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) at the University of Saskatchewan said that tobacco plants have been used for scientific discovery for years and could lead to a promising vaccine technology going forward.

""We understand that tobacco is probably the most dangerous plant in the world causing the most deaths — but do we throw away all that technology because of that?"" she said.

""Medicago's technology is robust. It's led to a fantastic vaccine with a good safety profile and good effectiveness. I feel that there's a path forward that needs to be explored and it's unfortunate that there are ties to tobacco companies.""

The efficacy of the vaccine against all variants studied prior to the emergence of Omicron was 71 per cent and even slightly higher for the Delta variant at 75 per cent against infections of any severity according to data released by Medicago in December.

International Development Minister Harjit Sajjan urged the WHO to approve the Medicago shot so that 20 million doses could be donated to the global vaccine-sharing initiative COVAX and used in countries with lower vaccination rates.

But WHO officials said Wednesday that COVID-19 vaccine supply in lower income countries has actually ""stabilized"" this year due to donations from COVAX despite the fact that one-third of the world still hasn't had a first dose — including 83 per cent of Africa.

Thompson the bioethicist said if the WHO were to ultimately approve the Medicago shot it would be one way for Canada to address the global inequities it has contributed to by vaccine hoarding.

""There are competing harms here — there's the harm of allowing Philip Morris to potentially profit from this but there's also the harm of withdrawing the opportunity for millions of people to receive a vaccine"" she said.

""And I think I know which side I would come down on — I think the moral importance of saving a life is greater.""

Canada working on 'solutions' with Medicago

Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne said last week that the federal government is working with Medicago to find a solution ""because we want that vaccine to be available for the world.

Conservative MPs called on Champagne and Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos this week to answer to the health committee on the WHO decision and explain what the federal government's plan is moving forward.

""There needs to be transparency when the government invests $173 million"" Conservative MP and health critic Michael Barrett said in a statement.

Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne said last week that the federal government is working with Medicago to find a solution 'because we want that vaccine to be available for the world.' (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)

Champagne said the company is aware that its involvement with the tobacco industry presents a problem and implied it was talking to Phillip Morris about divesting. Philip Morris International did not respond to a request for comment.

""With respect to shareholding there'll be solutions"" he said. ""The company is aware and they're working on that.""

Cynthia Callard executive director for Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada said the government should try to resolve the situation with the WHO by ensuring Philip Morris is no longer an investor in the company — and hope for the best with the pending approval.

""Medicago is not a one off"" she said. ""The solution is to get Philip Morris out of Medicago and if WHO still will not approve the vaccine … then it's going to be an expensive lesson.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA0LzAyL21hcmxib3JvLW1ha2VyLXBsb3RzLW1lZGljYWwtY2FubmFiaXMtaW5oYWxlci11ay1waGFybWEtZmlybS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marlboro maker plots major push into cannabis with Vectura,"Philip Morris the company behind Marlboro cigarettes is plotting a major push into the cannabis sector with the inhaler maker it bought for £1bn in a heavily-criticised takeover last year.

The world’s biggest tobacco seller wants to develop “cannabinoid products that help people take wellbeing into their own hands” following its purchase of Vectura a pharmaceutical business that makes drugs to combat diseases caused by smoking for the NHS.

The pair along with Danish company Fertin Pharma also want to roll out medical cannabis to treat heart attacks and chronic pain.

Philip Morris’s £1.2bn acquisition of Chippenham-based Vectura last year sparked indignation among anti-smoking campaigners.

In response to the criticism and threats that Vectura would be ejected from medical research groups Philip Morris pledged to run the pharmaceuticals firm separately from its tobacco business.

But marketing material published last week read: “Vectura Fertin Pharma brings together Vectura’s expertise in inhalation Fertin Pharma’s leadership in oral and intra-oral delivery systems and Philip Morris International’s pre-clinical expertise and worldwide reach and scale.”

Deborah Arnott chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) said: “Last August PMI [Philip Morris International] gave a public commitment ‘to operate Vectura as an autonomous business unit’.

“Less than nine months later Vectura and PMI are closely entwined in a joint venture.”

A spokesman for Philip Morris said: “PMI has created an autonomous wellness and healthcare business unit – Vectura Fertin Pharma – that brings together recent acquisitions. Vectura and Fertin will now operate as wholly owned subsidiaries of Vectura Fertin Pharma and maintain their own leadership teams.

“Vectura Fertin Pharma has no plan to roll out any recreational cannabis product.”

It comes after Will Downie and Paul Fry quit their respective roles as chief executive and finance head of Vectura last week following the deal’s completion.

Jorge Insuasty chief life sciences officer at Philip Morris praised the two executives for turning Vectura “into a leading inhaled therapeutic products company”.",,,,,,,,,

King Family,"Special to the E-E

The Bartlesville Community Foundation will again recognize the impactful contributions of three local families during its annual Legacy Hall of Fame gala. The event will be held on Saturday May 14 at the Bartlesville Community Center. During the event the BCF will present one of two Legacy Awards to the David B. King family.

The second of four sons David King was born in Okmulgee in 1955 to Joe and Peggy King. Ten years later the family moved to Enid where David’s father continued his career in banking. Joe King also became actively involved in local civic clubs and the chamber of commerce just as he had done in Okmulgee.

Upon graduating high school David followed in his father’s footsteps by attending Westminster College in Fulton Mo. where he studied history and business administration. During his time there he continued to date Marilyn Moore an Enid native who received a Bachelor of Fine Arts with an emphasis in painting and advertising design from Phillips University. After earning their degrees the couple married in the summer of 1977 and moved to Norman where David attended law school at the University of Oklahoma while Marilyn worked in OU Publications as a graphic artist.

In 1980 the couple arrived in Bartlesville. David interviewed with the Brewer Worten Robinett law firm (now Robinett King) while Marilyn interviewed with Phillips Petroleum Company in public and governmental affairs. Both were offered jobs and have lived in Bartlesville ever since.

Following in his father’s footsteps again David became very active in the community. His civic involvement has included the Bartlesville Chamber of Commerce Bartlesville Development Authority and Elder Care. He’s also led and participated in numerous elections for the City of Bartlesville and Bartlesville Public Schools. David is also one of the founders of the Bartlesville Community Foundation. He currently serves as chairman of the board at Jane Phillips Medical Center. Marilyn designed the Phillips – The First 66 Years book logos for the Bartlesville Centennial Sunfest and Service League cookbook along with promotional materials for the Bartlesville Symphony local arts groups and the Tulsa Opera. Marilyn also painted the buffalo outside First Presbyterian Church. She has taught Bible studies for local churches and facilitated small prayer/study groups in the community. Both David and Marilyn have been long-time public school volunteers.

The Kings are parents of three adult sons all of whom attended Bartlesville schools.

Brice works for Wells Fargo in Tulsa. He and his wife Christie are the parents of twin girls. Spencer is a CPA for Phillips 66. He and his wife Camie have a son and a daughter. Jason is a neurologist for the local hospital. He and his wife Shannon are the parents of two boys. All three of the adult sons and their families continue the family legacy of civic and charitable involvement.

The Bartlesville Community Foundation will also honor the Keleher family with a Legacy Hall of Fame Award. And the third annual Heritage Family Award will be given to the Creel family which traces its Washington County roots to 1899 eight years before statehood.

National Water Safety Month is an annual awareness campaign coordinated by PHTA the American Red Cross the National Drowning Prevention Alliance (NDPA) the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) and the World Waterpark Association (WWA) with the purpose of highlighting the importance of water safety education and sharing best practices for both children and adults when they are in and around water.

Since 2003 National Water Safety Month has been celebrated every May by thousands of aquatics facilities businesses and professionals around the country. The public awareness campaign provides educational programming public service announcements government proclamations business promotions and water safety-themed materials designed to help prevent water-related illnesses injuries and fatalities.

PHTA joined the Coalition in 2009 and has been leading the conversation about how to promote safe and healthy aquatic environments. PHTA’s involvement in National Water Safety Month has led to national media coverage; improved legislation at the federal state and local levels; and critical advocacy efforts throughout the United States.

“The pool spa and hot tub industry plays an important role in sharing the lifesaving messaging around water safety to those who work in the industry as well as to their customers” says Sabeena Hickman CAE President and CEO of PHTA. “We are proud to offer resources such as our national standards for pool and spa construction and maintenance our consumer safety brochures and our Step Into Swim drowning prevention initiative to further raise awareness during National Water Safety Month.”

The Coalition supports water safety activities throughout the month and during peak swim season including:

International Water Safety Day

International Water Safety Day (May 15 2024) is designed to help spread global awareness about drowning prevention and educate youth about becoming safer in and around water. May 15th is a day to share drowning awareness and water safety education by any means possible.

World’s Largest Swimming Lesson

Celebrating its 15th anniversary in 2024 the World’s Largest Swimming Lesson™ (June 20 2024) is a global event that includes tens of thousands of participants on six continents working to raise awareness about the fundamental importance of teaching children to swim. Aquatic facilities are encouraged to register as Host Locations during the month of May.

State Proclamations

In preparation for National Water Safety Month the Coalition works to secure gubernatorial proclamations to draw attention to this issue at the state level. Annually 45-50 Governors proclaim May as National Water Safety Month to support this important work. Proclamations are added throughout the month.

Safe Swimmer Pledge

Anyone can join the movement to reinforce the importance of water safety and become an advocate in the community. For example the Safe Swimmer Pledge encourages children to practice safe swimming behaviors such as never swimming alone and obeying pool rules.

Social Media Conversations

The Coalition will share safety tips and resources across its social media channels throughout the month. Follow along on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook and join the #watersafetymonth #NWSM2024 conversations. Shareable content is also available through the NDPA’s Water Safety Season Toolkit.

May marks the beginning of swim season as beaches pools waterparks and community center pools begin to open and people begin to spend more time outdoors. The National Water Safety Month Coalition is determined to increase awareness about vital water safety practices to help keep children and their families safer around all kinds of water. Learning to swim and practicing safe behaviors are critical first steps.

“Drowning is the leading cause of death among children ages 1–4. It is an epidemic but a preventable one” says Olympic Gold Medalist Rowdy Gaines Vice President of Partnerships & Development at PHTA who leads the Step Into Swim drowning prevention initiative. “I want everyone to experience the joy that swimming can bring and that starts with raising awareness of the importance of swim lessons and water safety best practices. The work done during National Water Safety Month is truly lifesaving.”

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzNWNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy9vaGlvLXBvbGl0aWNzL3Byb2N0ZXItYW5kLWdhbWJsZS1oZWlyZXNzLXByb3Bvc2VzLWJpbGwtdG8tc3RvcC10aGUtdHlwZS1vZi1hbmltYWwtdGVzdGluZy1wLWctaGFzLWRvbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter and Gamble heiress proposes bill to stop type of animal testing,"COLUMBUS Ohio — The heiress of Procter and Gamble a multi-billion dollar consumer goods company is proposing legislation in the Ohio House to stop cosmetics testing on animals. P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials. It is therefore unclear whether the proposed state bill HB 495 could have a negative impact on new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual - cosmetic and medical - application.""

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

Don Bacon • Nebraska Examiner,"A campaign called “Unrig Our Economy Nebraska” launched Saturday saying it wants to educate voters about how those in power favor corporations and the wealthy at the expense of working people.

The group is part of a national effort that plans to spend more than $1 million in Nebraska to educate voters according to Kevin Cass the group’s campaign manager.

It is aiming its publicity campaign at positions taken by U.S. Rep. Don Bacon a Republican who represents the 2nd Congressional District. The group cited his votes for decreasing corporate income taxes and against the American Rescue Plan Act which Unrig our Economy says will help middle-class families and avoid a recession.

‘Corporate cronies’

“The big Republican elephant in the room is Representative Don Bacon’s complicity with his corporate cronies to rig our economy against working Nebraskans” Cass said in a news release. “The working people of Nebraska deserve a leader who stands up for working people.”

Unrig Our Economy Nebraska announced its campaign Saturday morning during a news conference at Omaha’s Turner Park.

As a 501(c)4 nonprofit political group the organization does not have to report its donors or report its expenditures maintaining that they are “educating” voters and not calling for a vote for or against a politician. Cass declined to say who is supporting Unrig the Economy Nebraska.

Similar campaign in Iowa

A similar campaign that launched Thursday in Iowa lists labor unions and progressive groups as supporters. The Iowa group is targeting decisions of U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson a Republican who represents a northeast Iowa district.

Cass said progressive economic policies are widely popular with Americans but they do not realize that their elected officials are not backing them with votes in Congress.

Since 2017 Bacon has represented the Omaha-area’s 2nd District which is seen as a swing district that could go Republican or Democrat. In 2020 for instance 2nd District voters backed Democrat Joe Biden for president while voting for Donald Trump in 2018.

Bacon is opposed in the GOP primary by Steve Kuehl of Gretna. The Democratic Party has two primary election candidates State Sen. Tony Vargas and Alisha Shelton.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbW1vbmRyZWFtcy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA0LzAyL3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlLWxhd21ha2Vycy11cy1hbmQtamFwYW4tY2FsbC1iaWRlbi1jbGFyaWZ5LW5vLWZpcnN0LXVzZS1udWNsZWFyLXBvbGljedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Progressive Lawmakers in US and Japan Call on Biden to Clarify 'No-First-Use Nuclear Policy',"Dozens of progressive lawmakers in the United States and Japan are urging President Joe Biden to make a ""sensible"" shift and commit the U.S. to a policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons ""at any time or under any circumstances.""

""It is never too late to commit to a no-first-use policy.""

The demand which is also directed at Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida came in a letter dated Friday.

The effort was led by lawmakers including Congressional Progressive Caucus chair U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as well as Progressive Caucus of Japan chair and Diet House of Representatives member Masaharu Nakagawa.

The group's call comes as Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine has escalated fears of atomic warfare especially as Russian President Vladimir Putin has waved a ""nuclear saber"" with recent declarations.

Biden last month signed off on his administration's Nuclear Posture Review a policy which to the disappointment of nonproliferation advocates walks back his 2020 campaign promise of no-first-use. The NPR according to U.S. officials instead leaves open the possible use of nuclear weapons in response to non-nuclear warfare.

But the lawmakers stressed in their letter ""it is never too late to commit to a no-first-use policy.""

Addressing the ""nuclear umbrella"" security alliance between the two nations the letter states: ""A no-first-use policy would not weaken the U.S. ability to protect Japan and itself from a nuclear attack. That protection is based on the promise of U.S. nuclear retaliation not on the ability to strike first. In fact a no-first-use policy would increase protection against a nuclear attack by reducing doubt miscalculation and the possibility of an accidental nuclear launch.""

Additionally ""a U.S. declaration stating that it would never start a nuclear war supported by Japan would breathe new life into international efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate the danger of nuclear war"" the lawmakers assert. ""This is especially important at a time when tensions between the nuclear-weapons-possessing states especially between the United States and China are increasing.""

As The Associated Pressreported Saturday Russia's attack on Ukraine has added new fears of a nuclear exchange.

""For U.S. officials and world leaders discussions of how to respond to a limited nuclear attack are no longer theoretical"" AP reported.

""One overarching concern is that by casting some nuclear weapons as tactical weapons to be used in battle Russia could break the nearly eight-decade global taboo against using a nuclear weapon against another country."" Yet AP added ""even comparatively small tactical nuclear weapons approach the strength of the atomic bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima Japan in World War II.""

The demand to the U.S. and Japanese leaders came a week after 16 Nobel Peace Prize winners released an open letter calling for an immediate end to the assault of Ukraine and the total elimination of nuclear weapons.

""The time to ban and eliminate nuclear weapons is now. It is the only way to guarantee that the inhabitants of the planet will be safe from this existential threat"" they wrote.

Christopher Anderson/Magnum for The New York Times Talk Thomas Piketty Thinks America Is Primed for Wealth Redistribution

In 2013 the French economist Thomas Piketty in his best seller “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” a book eagerly received in the wake of the 2008 economic collapse put forth the notion that returns on capital historically outstrip economic growth (his famous r>g formula). The upshot? The rich get richer while the rest of us stay stuck in the mud. Now nearly a decade later Piketty is set to publish “A Brief History of Equality” in which he argues that we’re on a trajectory of greater not less equality and lays out his prescriptions for remedying our current corrosive wealth disparities. (In short: Tax the rich.) If the line from one book to the other looks slightly askew given the state of the world then Piketty suggests you’re looking from the wrong vantage point. “I am relatively optimistic” says Piketty who is 50 “about the fact that there is a long-run movement toward more equality which goes beyond the little details of what happens within a specific decade.”

In the time since “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” was published there has been a huge proliferation in the number of American billionaires. Something like 130 new ones were added between 2020 and 2021 alone. That happened in the context of growing public discussion — and anger — about economic inequality. So what the hell happened? What enabled the ultrawealthy to flourish in the face of such widespread antipathy? Let me put this very clearly: I understand that each year and each decade is tremendously important but it’s also important not to forget about the general evolution. We have become much more equal societies in terms of political equality economic equality social equality as compared with 100 years ago 200 years ago. This movement which began with the French and U.S. revolutions I think it is going to continue.

Of course there are structural factors that make it difficult: the system of political finance the structure of media finance the basic democratic institutions are less democratic than they should be. This makes things complicated. But it’s always been complicated. The Supreme Court for decades made it impossible to create a progressive income tax. They were fine with the racial segregation but having a progressive income tax was unconstitutional. In the end it took 20 years to change the Constitution but then it happened and contributed to reduced inequality.

OK so you’re saying that the long-term trend is toward more equality. But in 1990 there were 66 U.S. billionaires. Now there are more than 700. Over the last 40 years or so chief-executive pay is up more than 900 percent even accounting for inflation. The average worker’s pay over the same period is up only 12 percent. You believe we should be thinking of those facts as road bumps on the path to greater economic equality? If you take the big picture yes. But the other lesson from the big picture from history is that it takes major political mobilization to keep moving in the direction of equality. In the United States today the democratic institutions the rules of the game are set up in a manner that indeed the rich are entrenched. But if you look at opinion polls about a billionaire tax in the U.S. — among Democratic and also Republican voters — you have huge approval. So is the political system able to respond to this or is it rigged? The lesson from history is that when the political system is rigged at some point you have a reaction you have a mobilization.

What did you think of the billionaire tax that Biden just proposed? It would have been better before his election. If you had told the American public before the elections that he wanted a wealth tax — which again is something that is very high in opinion polls — this would have been much easier. This could have forced the Democratic Congress to take a stand. It’s more complicated now. But if it works it’s better than nothing.

I understand what you’re saying about the popularity of a proposed billionaire tax but do you believe America is at a place where a phrase like “wealth redistribution” which is what you’re talking about is broadly politically plausible? When you say Americans don’t like redistribution some certainly don’t like it but in the 20th century high progressive taxation of income and inherited wealth was to a large extent invented in the United States. That’s why it always makes me skeptical when people say Americans don’t like this don’t like that. Look at history! There’s no deterministic reason why a given country should be this or that. Sometimes in my country and in the U.S. also people tell you “Look we are not Swedes.” This is used as an argument to say that there is a culture of equality in Sweden which we would never have.

But Swedes themselves weren’t always “Swedes.” Exactly. Sweden until 1910 1920 was one of the most unequal countries in the world with a special sophistication in the way inequality was organized. You could have between one and 100 votes depending on the size of your wealth. Even corporations had the right to vote in municipal elections in Sweden until 1910. Sweden was like this but then moved to something else.

This is only a half-joking question: Let’s say in the United States the billionaires get sick of being the bad guys and don’t want to be taxed the way Biden is proposing so they move to Ireland or some other tax haven. Then what happens? But that’s the point: These people don’t live in an autarchy. They rely on the rest of the world which means that we have to impose rules on the conditions in which they can enjoy these assets — which were produced by the collective. All wealth is collective by nature in the sense that it relies on the work of hundreds thousands millions of engineers technicians the accumulation of knowledge. Then private property is a social construction that we invent in order to organize economic and social relations. It’s a very useful social invention as long as you keep under control how much you can accumulate how much power you can concentrate etc. But none of these assets are their assets. They are a product of a collective process. No one invented anything by himself or herself.

That kind of ontological argument might be a hard sell for some Americans. For some but this has nothing to do with the American spirit American values. It has something to do with a small subset of people who are just pushing their interests. If you ask the American public about who is working hard is it the normal people or the elite? Whose effort created everything? You will be surprised by the answer.

My sense is that in the very recent past a lot of the growth in wealth has resulted from entrepreneurship rather than the accumulation of inherited wealth. That’s in conjunction with skyrocketing rates of return for the wealthy. Do those factors have any implications for how we understand the accumulation of capital generally or r>g specifically? If you go back to the beginning of the 20th century late 19th century you also had lots of new innovation and new wealth. We invented the automobile electricity trans-Atlantic radio. People in every time period tend to say today is different this is big innovation new wealth but in a changing economy where we make technological discoveries you always have this process. But the thing is if it’s not regulated if we don’t design institutions in order to spread the wealth — on the contrary we have an institutional setup where you accumulate wealth by using public infrastructure public education the health system and then once you have accumulated the wealth you push a button and you transfer it somewhere else. Remember the ProPublica study before the summer of 2021 where they looked at billionaires in the U.S.? They pay almost zero federal income tax as compared with their wealth. If you pay no tax it’s easier to accumulate more wealth and that’s what continues.

An economic argument in favor of billionaires is that their doing well is a sign that our system of capitalism is working and that it means growth for everyone. But growth has been slowing down at the exact same time that billionaires have been rolling in it. Has that given definitive lie to the idea that the success of the 0.1 percent is good for the rest of us too? It’s proof as far as proof can get in the social and political sciences. The evidence that we have is that if you take the United States the growth rate of national income per capita has been divided by two following the Reagan decade. It’s been a little more than 1 to 1.2 percent per year — the national income per capita real growth rate between 1990 and 2020. It used to be more than 2 2.5 percent between 1950 and 1980. The tax performance in the Reagan decade was supposed to boost growth: Maybe you would have more inequality but the size of the pie is going to grow so much faster than before that the average wages and income of average Americans will grow like you’ve never seen. This is not what we’ve seen.

The big lesson from this is that the period of maximum prosperity of the U.S. economy in the middle of the century was a period where you had a top income-tax rate of 90 percent 80 percent and this was not a problem because income gaps of 1 to 100 or 1 to 200 are not necessary for growth. The other big conclusion is that what really matters for economic prosperity is education and relative equality in education. The key reason the U.S. economy was so productive historically in the middle of the 20th century was because of a huge educational advance over Europe. In the 1950s you have 90 percent of the young generation going to high school in the U.S. At the same time it’s 20 to 30 percent in Germany France Britain Japan. The story that Reagan tried to tell the country in the ’80s which is basically forget about equality the key to prosperity is to let the top become richer and richer — it doesn’t work.

Have you seen any structural or ideological changes that you think make our moment different from historically comparable ones? Well the dominant ideology has been moving toward the view that we’ve gone too far in terms of market liberalization in terms of globalization without regulation and the superrich getting richer. The problem is that we’re still stuck with institutions that were set up in the ’80s and ’90s in terms of limited tax progressivity free capital flows without any common collective regulation without financial cadastre so that you can track who owns what where — which is a big problem when you want to impose sanctions on oligarchs.

In the United States this institutional setup has been reinforced because of Trump’s big tax cut on corporations. There are many dramas we associated with Trump but part of the drama is that he has been able to tell the middle class and lower middle class “Look we are going to continue with tax dumping but I’m going to protect you in another way by protecting you against Chinese and Mexicans the Muslims.” He was able to be elected on an ideology where you don’t redistribute between the rich and the poor but rather you protect Americans especially white male Americans against anybody who looks foreign. The risk is that neoliberalism is replaced by this form of neo-nationalism in order to avoid redistribution. Sometimes people like Trump can be successful with this strategy because it’s a much clearer message than saying “Let’s look at the history of progressive taxation.”

You mentioned oligarchs. In America we don’t like to think that we have them — that’s for a country like Russia. Instead we like to think we have entrepreneurs who achieved through merit. But the similarities are obvious: They’re all taking advantage of the free global movement of capital and have a disproportionate amount of political influence. Do you see America as being as securely in the grip of the oligarchic class as other countries we think of as being less democratic? The U.S. oligarchs have less control of the political system than the Putin clique in Russia that’s for sure. In terms of what fraction of wealth accumulation is due to individual effort individual merit as opposed to a legal and institutional system that is working for them more than for the rest of the country it’s difficult to say. Many Russian oligarchs bought the right assets at the right time resold it. This is business life.

To me maybe the best comparison between the U.S. is not so much with Russia today but with Europe and the Belle Époque before 1914: a system which is nominally democratic but where the concentration of wealth is so high and lacking proper rules about political finance political influence that the democratic system is not enabled to have a common-sense reaction to this excessive level of inequality that in the long run is not good for U.S. prosperity. Particularly because when other countries get more educated than the U.S. then its economic leadership will be gone forever. U.S. economic leadership came from mass education not from a small elite of billionaires. They have never been the source of U.S. prosperity and they will never be.

You know I do find it hard to wrap my head around the idea that after 40 years of worsening inequality you — the inequality guy Mr. r>g — are publishing a book saying we’re on the right track historically. It’s sort of cold comfort to know we’re more equal today than we were 100 or 200 years ago. Really give me a reason to feel as optimistic as you do. “Give me a reason to be optimistic?” By looking at my historical evidence by thinking about the big picture I have become more optimistic. I was a bit puzzled that many people looking at “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” came away with a pessimistic conclusion. I’m trying to show that the key in history is not the big catastrophes but the positive political construction of an alternative and this process started with the French Revolution the U.S. revolution. This process toward more equality is more deeply rooted in our modern ethos and modern political cultures than most people believe. I remember in 2014 having a public discussion with Elizabeth Warren in Boston. I was talking about a progressive wealth tax with a rate of 5 percent per year or 10 percent per year on billionaires. She looked at me like Wow that’s too much. Joe Biden today a centrist Democrat — who voted for the Tax Reform Act of 1986 — is coming in with a wealth tax. Things can change pretty fast.

This interview has been edited and condensed from two conversations.

David Marchese is a staff writer for the magazine and the columnist for Talk. Recently he interviewed Neal Stephenson about portraying a utopian future Laurie Santos about happiness and Christopher Walken about acting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3doYXQtdGhlLWxlZnQta2VlcHMtZ2V0dGluZy13cm9uZy1hYm91dC1mcmVlLXNwZWVjaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What the Left Keeps Getting Wrong About Free Speech,"Free speech is a left-wing value.

As a matter of self-preservation any movement arrayed against the most powerful forces in our society needs to care about the right of free expression. And as a matter of principle it’s not possible to separate the goal of empowering the working class from the necessity of opposing those who think ordinary working-class people are too dumb to be trusted to listen to different points of view and make up their own minds.

As such I’m always disturbed when I see some of my friends and comrades on the left dismissing concerns about the weakening of free speech norms as merely an unserious preoccupation of elites who just don’t like being criticized.

Our position should be to zealously defend what few free speech protections already exist in a late capitalist society where most employment is “at-will” and most political speech happens on platforms controlled by a few corporations. And we should pledge to fight like hell to deepen and extend such rights to all the tens of millions of anonymous people who enjoy no meaningful safeguards against being fired or deplatformed for speaking their minds.

When the New York Times’ editorial board recently declared that “America has a free speech problem” the responses were more interesting than the essay itself. The Times tried to give its discussion a sheen of objectivity by commissioning a poll (with Siena College) but the wording of the questions was sometimes too sloppy for the results to mean much.

Several questions focus on whether people hold their tongues out of “fear of retaliation or harsh criticism”—but there’s a world of difference between the two. I’ve been fired and I’ve been harshly criticized and of the two I’ll take harsh criticism every time. You can reasonably hold that the incidents described in Jon Ronson’s book So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed for example go far beyond “criticism” and into a troubling form of retaliation—but if this is what the Times/Siena College poll questions meant to refer to the wording didn’t succeed in making that clear.

The Times’ writers also didn’t clarify whether they were saying that free speech is in worse shape in America now than it’s ever been before or just that it’s in worse shape now than it was say a few years ago. The first claim would clearly be false. The second is a lot more plausible. But the question of whether either is true misses the larger point.

The reality is that whether or not you think there’s a “problem” with something is a question that concerns values and not just facts.

Does America have a lack-of-health-insurance problem? I certainly think so. But someone who wanted to dismiss that could point out that tens of millions more people who were uninsured before Congress passed Obamacare are insured now or for that matter that hospitals have been legally prevented since the 1980s from refusing entrance to emergency rooms to patients who are unable to pay. Of course doctors and hospitals can still deny you life-saving preventative care and if you return from the hospital alive you can be bankrupted by the bill but there’s no denying that the situation has improved. The question is whether it’s improved enough.

The same argument could be applied to police brutality. Anyone who knows a little about the history of the civil rights movement for example knows that police violence was often far more brazen and openly racist in the relatively recent past. But I wouldn’t tell anyone outraged at how few unjustified police shootings result in successful prosecutions to stop complaining because by historical standards it’s not that much of a problem.

The New York Times editorial mentioned both attempts to shut down controversial speakers on campuses and efforts by Republican state legislatures to ban discussion of controversial ideas in the classroom and explicitly said the latter was worse—but they were still widely criticized for “false equivalence” for even mentioning both the large threats and the small ones at the same time.

A clumsy turn of phrase in the New York Times editorial about a “right” to speak one’s mind without fear of shaming or shunning was widely attacked as a misrepresentation of the legal right to free speech. But the real question is whether we care about the corrosive effect of the widespread use of shunning and shaming tactics when it comes to avoiding debate about controversial issues.

“ We shouldn’t shrug our shoulders when someone famous is fired or deplatformed. We should seize the opportunity to talk about how much less protection is afforded to the average person against such things happening to them. ”

Firing people deplatforming them on social media or canceling their lectures on campuses are clear-cut free speech issues. But even slightly more nebulous concerns over shaming and shunning shouldn’t be dismissed quite so easily.

The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (and various laws in other countries protecting free speech) are important because they offer a safeguard against one particularly egregious category of threats to the values of open debate and a free flow of information—direct retaliation by the government. But saying that something isn’t a free speech issue because nothing anyone does is violating the First Amendment is like saying that environmentalists protesting corporate pollution must be wrong if the polluters aren’t violating any provisions of the Environmental Protection Act.

I’m not surprised that some mainstream progressives make excuses for attempts to shut down events on college campuses that offend some students or even advocate for corporations to change the rules to make it easier to deplatform social media users.

As Thomas Frank argued in his book Listen Liberal: Or What Ever Happened to the Party of the People? the dominant ideology of the contemporary Democratic Party isn’t left-populism rooted in organized labor but a kind of technocratic liberalism—within which ideological battles are understood as “problems” best “solved” through the application of technocratic expertise.

This kind of liberalism reinterprets “social justice” not as raising the floor for the working-class majority but as removing every barrier to the best and brightest from each group rising through the ranks to join this class of benevolent experts. Within this framework it makes perfect sense to spend your time worrying that ignorant proles will have their minds warped by “disinformation” or other “dangerous” ideas.

What’s more disturbing is seeing people whose politics basically align with mine echo the culture-war talking points of the technocratic liberals on free speech issues.

I’d beg people who’ve learned to roll their eyes (or make jokes about frozen peaches) when they hear the phrase “free speech” to look into the history of Ida B. Wells’ newspaper The Memphis Free Speech or the “free speech fights” waged by radical labor unionists in the early 20th century or the role of the Free Speech Movement at UC-Berkeley in giving birth to the New Left.

If you think American society as it exists is fundamentally flawed and should be transformed in a radically more egalitarian direction your first instinct should be to push for broader protections of dissent rather than narrower ones. We should be less worried about “bad” ideas being spread within the current limits of mainstream discourse than about better ones not being heard.

As Noam Chomsky pointed out in an interview with my late friend Michael Brooks (shortly before Chomsky signed the 2020 “Harper’s Letter” on free speech and open debate) people who shrug off attempts to stop speakers from speaking on campuses as “just more speech” should think a little harder about the long history of leftist speakers being stopped from speaking on campuses—to cite just one obvious example during the McCarthy era and immediately afterward.

There’s also a deep question of principle here. Historically the left has certainly had its share of hypocrites who claimed to care about empowering the working class while actually supporting Stalinist regimes that trampled free speech and every other democratic ideal.

But what about the part of the left that’s always been serious about its stated values? If we share in the belief of the great 20th-century Marxist and pan-Africanist writer CLR James that every cook can govern that egalitarianism should shape how we respond to discussions of free speech.

When The New York Times in 2020 published a genuinely disturbing editorial by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton calling for then-President Donald Trump to send troops to quell post-George Floyd unrest in American cities the left missed an opportunity. Instead of adding our voices to those of mainstream liberals scolding the “Paper of Record” and pressuring the then-opinion editor to resign we should have asked why they didn’t publish it side by side with a response by someone like the leftist academic Cornel West. Do we really not believe that West would have been more persuasive than Sen. Cotton?

Was the “Harper’s Letter” signed not just by people like Noam Chomsky who has a long history of defending the free speech of even his most extreme enemies but by various figures with a history of hypocrisy on the issue? Instead of using the latter to completely dismiss the concerns expressed in the letter itself we should have praised the letter’s simple message and criticized some of its signatories for not living up to its stated principles.

We shouldn’t shrug our shoulders when someone famous is fired or deplatformed. We should seize the opportunity to talk about how much less protection is afforded to the average person against such things happening to them. And we should push to rebuild the labor movement at American workplaces as well as acting politically to change employment law so everyone is free to speak their mind.

The results of this won’t always be pretty. Ignorance and bigotry are very real.

But in a world marred by runaway levels of economic inequality and a military-industrial complex that literally threatens the continued existence of human civilization it’s hard to accept the idea that we should be more worried about too many dissenting ideas being freely expressed or elite actors having too little power to shape the limits of public discourse. Now more than ever the left needs to fight for free speech.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlc29sdXRpb25mb3VuZGF0aW9uLm9yZy9wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMvaGFwcHktbmV3LXRheC15ZWFyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Happy new tax year? • Resolution Foundation,"The start of the new tax year brings with it one of Rishi Sunak’s major tax reforms: the rise in National Insurance announced last September and linked to additional support for the NHS and social care. This spotlight explores what this rate rise – together with freezes in the Income Tax personal allowance the newly-announced National Insurance threshold rise due in July and an Income Tax rate cut due in 2024-25 – will mean for workers households the tax system and the public finances.

What changes are happening?

The new fiscal year 2022-23 brings a number of immediate changes that will affect household incomes. Most benefits are rising by (only) 3.1 per cent; the National Living Wage is rising by 6.6 per cent to £9.50 an hour; and the energy price cap is rising by 54 per cent. Around four in every five households are due to receive a £150 rebate in April through the Council Tax system (although English Council Tax bills will also rise by an average of 3.4 per cent); a 5p Fuel Duty cut has already taken effect; and VAT on hospitality has now returned to its pre-pandemic rate of 20 per cent. But there are also a number of changes occurring in the direct tax system:

The four-year freezing of Income Tax thresholds begins (alongside a freezing of Inheritance Tax Capital Gains Tax and VAT thresholds). This will not mean a nominal jump in anyone’s tax bills but means that the personal allowance will remain at £12570 rather than rising (by the 3.1 per cent that it would have done had the Treasury followed its usual rules) to £12960 and the higher-rate threshold will remain at £50270. Tax rates for dividend income are rising by 1.25 percentage points as part of the ‘Health and Social Care Levy’ package. This only affects people with over £2000 of dividend income – not including anything received within ISAs or pensions – and raises only around £600 million a year and so is not a focus of this spotlight. Most significantly all National Insurance (NI) rates will rise by 1.25 percentage points in April (ahead of the true ‘Health and Social Care Levy’ being introduced in April 2023). This effects employers employees and the self-employed and means that the basic NI rate for employees will rise from 12 per cent to 13.25 per cent. Working in the opposite direction however the starting point for paying non-employer NI is rising in April from an annual equivalent of £9568 to £9880 – in line with the rate of inflation last autumn – but will then as announced in the Spring Statement jump to £12570 in July.

What effect will 2022’s National Insurance and Income Tax changes have on people?

The overall impact of these policy choices on people’s incomes will be complex as changes in allowances and thresholds interact in complicated ways with changes in rates. However in isolation they are more straightforward. We can characterise their effects as follows:

The freezing of the Income Tax personal allowance will leave (almost all of) the 33 million people who pay Income Tax each year around £80 worse off compared to a world where the Chancellor had followed the usual rules for uprating it (as well as bring around 400000 extra people into Income Tax) and the freezing of the higher-rate threshold will leave higher (and additional) rate payers an extra £160 worse off.

The personal NI rate rise will only affect earnings but as an extra 1.25 per cent tax on annual earnings above £9880 (in April) it will mean additional tax of around £200 a year for someone earning £27000 and around £1100 for someone earning £100000.

The significant increase in the NI threshold will mean a tax cut of £270 across 2022-23 (accounting for the fact that it does not take effect until July) for employees earning above the new threshold and will also take around 2 million workers out of direct tax altogether.

Those affected by these changes and also receiving Universal Credit (UC) will only get 45 per cent of any tax cut (or pay 45 per cent of any tax rise) as the benefit is tapered against net earnings so higher net earnings lead to a reduced UC award.

Figure 1 shows the combined impact of the three big changes for employees (ignoring the interaction with UC and excluding any impacts from increases in employer NI – although we discuss that further below). In the period from 6 April to 5 July workers will clearly be worse off with most losing around 1 per cent of their gross pay to higher NI and Income Tax (relative to a world where none of these changes was made). But when the starting point for NI increases in July everyone earning less than £32000 a year will be better off from the combination of these policies. In absolute and proportional terms the biggest winners will be those with earnings near £12570 a year (note that those earning below £9880 will be unaffected by any of these changes).

Figure 1: In 2022 the increase in the National Insurance threshold will more than offset other tax rises for many workers

Looking over 2022-23 as a whole those employees (below State Pension Age) earning between £9880 and £25000 – around 1-in-3 or 9 million employees – will pay less tax overall from the policy changes with around 15 million worse-off. Among the self-employed (who pay a lower rate of NI and therefore benefit less from the threshold increase) those earning below £20000 will be better off.

Given that the median retiree income is around £12000 the majority pay no Income Tax and are therefore unaffected by the personal allowance freeze at least for now (note that pensioners’ household incomes after housing costs are no lower than the rest of the population’s despite these low individual incomes).

Moving from individual to household-level incomes – in Figure 2 – also shows a progressive pattern for 2022-23’s personal tax changes with negligible or even positive average impacts on lower-income households and the greatest impacts (both in absolute and relative terms) for the highest-income households.

Figure 2: The total effect of personal tax changes in 2022-23 will be progressive

What effect will the changes have on the tax system?

The most significant impacts of these changes will undoubtedly be the direct effects on household incomes and on the funding of public services but the impacts on the tax system and its incentives should also be considered. A higher NI threshold will reduce participation tax rates increasing the incentive to start or remain in work while higher NI rates will reduce the incentive to earn extra though these are no doubt small effects.

It is welcome that the starting points for Income Tax and personal (but not employer) NI will now be aligned at £12570 (this will also be the starting point for the Health and Social Care Levy from April 2023). One difference between these thresholds however is that NI operates on a per job basis – whereas Income Tax is based on total income – and therefore people with two jobs get double the benefit from the threshold rise so April’s changes slightly increase the incentive to have multiple jobs.

A more important area of concern is that increasing employer NI worsens the tax system’s bias against employment. Following the April 2022 changes a market income of £30000 would attract over £2000 less tax if structured as self-employment rather than employment – as illustrated in Figure 3 – and there are even lower-tax possibilities via incorporation.

Figure 3: Increasing employer National Insurance exacerbates the tax system’s bias against employees

So far we have ignored the impact of the rise in employer NI. In the long-run much of the rise in employer NI will be passed on to employees in the form of lower pre-tax wages. The OBR estimate that April’s increase in employer NI will leave nominal earnings 0.5 per cent lower and prices 0.1 per cent higher than they would otherwise have been (though a small fraction of this may be offset by the increase in employers’ Employment Allowance that was announced in the Spring Statement).

What effect will the changes have on tax receipts and what is still to come?

Figure 4 sets out how much revenue these tax changes are expected to raise – or lose – in 2022-23 and beyond. This year’s Income Tax threshold freezes will raise around £3 billion a year for the Treasury but it is the April 2023 freeze that will doubtless be more significant given that under the current forecast for inflation this autumn these would ordinarily rise by around 7.5 per cent. The fact that inflation is currently forecast for be much higher than when the policy was announced means that while the four-year freeze was originally forecast (in 2021) to raise £8 billion in 2025-26 it is now forecast to raise £18 billion. One could argue that some of this revenue windfall has been redirected to cutting the basic rate of Income Tax which the Chancellor has announced will fall from 20 per cent to 19 per cent in April 2024 at a cost of around £6 billion a year.

The NI rate rise this year is expected to raise around £17 billion (although some of this is offset by extra funding provided to government departments to cover their own tax increases and the yield is also impacted by the assumption that the rise in employer NI will suppress wages which has fiscal implications). Raising the NI threshold will cost £6 billion in 2022-23 but this cost reduces over time as the threshold will be frozen until April 2026.

Figure 4: Beyond 2022-23 the most significant personal tax changes are expected to be the continued threshold freezes and the cut to the basic rate of Income Tax

Thinking about all these tax changes together almost all direct taxpayers will pay higher taxes in 2025-26 – with the exception being a small group of workers (with earnings of around £11000 to 13000) who earn enough to benefit from the raised NI threshold but not enough for that to be offset by the personal allowance freeze. The net impact on different groups will vary enormously however.

Looking first at retirees (or others whose income is not liable for NI) high inflation means that the four-year personal allowance freeze is now projected to cost them around £400 in 2025-26. For a retiree with an income of £50000 this is largely offset by the basic rate cut (worth £370 for them) but for someone on £15000 this only provides a £20 offset leading to a regressive pattern with the former losing only 0.1 per cent of their income but the latter losing 2.6 per cent (as shown in Figure 5). Higher-rate taxpayers however are additionally hit by the higher-rate threshold freeze.

The picture is broadly similar for employees despite the progressive combination of the NI threshold rise and NI rate rise. The net tax rise in 2025-26 is projected to be 1.7 per cent for an employee on £15000 but only 0.7 per cent for someone on £50000.

Figure 5: The confusing combination of income-related tax changes creates inequities between income groups and between sources of income

In terms of the overall household income distribution the package of tax changes is still progressive (most tax rises are). But it is hard to imagine that the pattern shown in Figure 4 is a deliberate optimal outcome. In the Spring Statement rather than cutting the basic rate of tax the Chancellor could have announced – for the same cost – that the starting point for tax would not be frozen at £12570 in 2024-25 and 2025-26 but would instead rise with inflation to £13200. This may not have been as memorable as a rate cut but it would have avoided this regressive pattern and would have been a better deal for employees earning below £34000 and retirees with incomes below £26000. As it stands there is set to be both an Income Tax rise and Income Tax cut in 2024-25 and a further tax rise in 2025-26 with a net transfer from lower- to higher-income individuals.

For now though it is the NI rate rise and (from July) the subsequent NI threshold rise that will have the biggest impact on workers’ pay checks alongside the even more significant impact of very high inflation on real incomes. As others at Resolution Foundation have noted: “promising a tax cut tomorrow while allowing benefits to fall today as prices soar just isn’t serious policy making”."

The DA recently released a controversial election ad in which the national flag is consumed by flames. Many took to social media to criticise the party with former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela expressing disappointment saying the DA could have used other ways to send its message. Do you think the DA took it too far with this ad?

Ram's appointment was opposed by management including CEO Khandani Msibi which mounted arguments that she was not a suitable curator.

As curator she paid the insurer's claims and planned the return to solvency.

But investigations prompted by Msibi's complaints showed that she had misled the Prudential Authority about her qualifications.

On 15 February the regulator applied to have her removed on 22 February but this application failed.

In the meantime she completed her report in which she suddenly said she didn't think the company should have been placed under curatorship at all.

The provisional curator of insolvent insurer 3Sixty Life which is owned by the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (Numsa) doesn't believe that the insolvent insurer should have been placed under curatorship. This is the story of how this conclusion came to be.

In late December 2021 the Prudential Authority launched an urgent application in the Johannesburg High Court to place 3Sixty Life under curatorship. The Prudential Authority argued that this was needed to prevent the collapse of the insurer and secure the claims of policyholders. The authority made an ex parte court application — meaning without the input of 3Sixty Life to ""avoid the risk of 3Sixty taking steps to misappropriate funds or otherwise act improperly or unlawfully upon gaining knowledge that a curator is on her way"".

Acting Judge Allyson Crutchfield agreed and the Prudential Authority was granted the order on 21 January.

From that point a curator — BDO Advisory Services' Head of Actuarial Predictive Analytics and Insurance Innovation Yashoda Ram – was in charge of the insurer's business. Through her claims were paid and a return to solvency planned.

The curatorship did not go down well in the ranks of Numsa's commercial empire. Khandani Msibi acting CEO of 3Sixty Life and grandee of Numsa's investment company launched a court attempt to regain control taking exception to Ram's appointment as curator.

In the Prudential Authority's founding affidavit Ram was presented to the court as their proposed curator — a person with 16 years of experience in the insurance sector. She is described as a ""member of the Actuarial Society of South Africa (ASSA)"" and the court is directed towards a brief CV in the annexures.

Here Ram is represented as a member of ASSA since 2009. She is also listed as a Certified Enterprise Risk Actuary since 2016. Ram provided a confirmatory affidavit to the founding affidavit confirming that she has seen the contents of the application that they were true and correct and repeats that she is a member of ASSA. This satisfied Acting Judge Crutchfield and she was appointed.

But Msibi's lengthy criticism of Ram's experience and performance as curator required a response from the Prudential Authority which was submitted to the court on 31 January.

Here the Prudential Authority presents Ram's experience in the financial sector more fully and places an emphasis on the team from BDO that was chosen to surround and support her.

Ram busters

But behind the scenes certain events during the drafting of this affidavit had rattled the Prudential Authority's confidence in Ram. On 29 February 2022 according to five people who submitted confirmatory affidavits to the court Ram had stated in a meeting held to finalise the Prudential Authority's reply to Msibi that she held an undergraduate degree in Actuarial Science from the University of Pretoria.

But Ram did not hold a degree in actuarial science; she did not hold an undergraduate degree of any sort. It was also not the case that Ram was a member proper of ASSA nor that she was a certified actuary.

According to the Prudential Authority Ram only corrected this mistake in the afternoon of 31 January as the Prudential Authority was finalising its affidavit.

She had by the Prudential Authority's estimation seven opportunities to correct her claim to possess an undergraduate degree before finally doing just so hours before the submission deadline for the affidavit. Further contended the regulator Ram could on several occasions have corrected the assertions that she was a fully-fledged member of ASSA and a certified auditor.

According to an affidavit by BDO's Head of Financial Services Pierre Jacobs he and a manager in BDO's financial services division Dylan Bywater began putting together a presentation on BDO's suitability to assume the role of curator in early October 2021.

In Jacobs's account which is supported by emails Ram provided them with an updated CV for the presentation which now contained the claim that she held ASSA membership and was a certified auditor. This CV was then sent to the Prudential Authority as part of BDO's pitch to take over the curatorship and was then used in the founding affidavit. Ram in her affidavit called this ""an easy spelling error to mistakenly overlook being the difference between 'completed' and 'completing'"".

Jacobs's affidavit makes it clear that BDO was aware that Ram did not have an undergraduate degree when they hired her in August 2021. But this was not communicated to the Prudential Authority clearly. In a now-removed webpage Ram's résumé on the BDO website present from 13 January 2022 stated that her qualifications included a BA in Actuarial Science and a BSc in Psychology.

In the days that followed the 31 January affidavit Msibi and 3Sixty Life's team continued to target Ram's suitability for the curatorship.

Ranti Mothapo of Matlotlo Group 3Sixty Life's First Line Actuarial Function corresponded with BDO actuary Tinashe Mashoko and strongly suggested that Mothapo would report Ram's breaches of ASSA code.

In February Ram forwarded the correspondence which had been copied to her by Mashoko to the Prudential Authority's legal team. The Prudential Authority's in-house legal counsel offered Ram some reassurance saying that there is no statutory requirement for a curator to also be an actuary.

But 3Sixty Life's claims that she was not fit for office clearly caused the Prudential Authority to reevaluate Ram - a candidate that they had promoted and defended at length in two separate affidavits.

On 9 February it became clear to the regulator after making inquiries with ASSA that Ram had not completed the coursework to qualify as a certified auditor and that Ram was a so-called ""student member"" of ASSA rather than a member proper. By ASSA's conventions Ram could not call herself an actuary.

Ram had in the Prudential Authority's eyes misrepresented herself and her proper qualifications. Further it appeared that 3Sixty Life was eyeing this apparent weakness in the curatorship as a way to restore control over its operations. The work of Ram and the BDO team had raised serious questions over the recapitalisation plans proposed by Msibi and had revealed mismanagement and many worrying breaches of regulation.

On 13 February the Prudential Authority contacted BDO to formally raise their concerns about Ram's qualifications. In its papers the Prudential Authority argued that at this point it had little choice but to seek her removal as curator and replace Ram with a BDO actuary with unimpeachable actuarial qualifications and standing.

On 15 February the Prudential Authority served Ram with papers seeking to have her removed as curator and replaced with Mashoko. Mashoko unlike Ram was in fact an actuary and had been working on the curatorship since the beginning.

On 16 February BDO served Ram with a letter of suspension. But Ram had been appointed as provisional curator of 3Sixty Life by order of court and her suspension did not change her status or responsibilities.

U-turn

On the same day at 13:45pm Ram sent an email to Msibi and other executives. She said she would be ""offline for the next few days"" and that her colleagues would complete the report to the court which was due five days later on 21 February. The following day on 22 February the application by the Prudential Authority to have her replaced as curator was set down to be heard by Judge Denise Fisher in the Johannesburg High Court.

But Ram did not hand over report writing duties to her colleagues. Instead she completed the report without discussing it with the BDO team that had been working on the curatorship alongside her and without considering their inputs. On 21 February Ram released her interim report which included no input from BDO's teams of actuaries accountants or lawyers.

As late as 11 February Ram had written that Msibi and 3Sixty Life management's ""disregard for curatorship is merely a symptom of their chronic lack of risk management and proper governance and of roles and responsibilities"". Ram had on several other occasions raised concerns about 3Sixty Life's proposed recapitalisation plan dire financial state and the company's disregard for regulations.

But now in this report Ram claimed that 3Sixty Life should never have been placed under curatorship. Ram wrote that if the regulator had ""considered the transaction prior to placing the licence under curatorship in all its merits the curatorship would not have been deemed necessary based on solvency alone and the outcomes of the Internal Recapitalisation Plan proposed at this time.""

The internal recapitalisation plan was the last-ditch proposal made by Msibi in early December to transfer over R100 million of property owned by 3Sixty Life's parent company Doves to the embattled insurer to boost its capital.

Ram's report continued to say that ""based on this report alone"" ""curatorship may have not been appropriate and notwithstanding other allegations put forward by the Prudential Authority should be opposed"".

The Prudential Authority saw this as spite.

""It seems she was reacting with vengeance and only wanted to try to embarrass the Authority"" wrote the Prudential Authority about Ram in a 12 March supplementary affidavit.

The Prudential Authority's urgent bid to replace Ram was not successful.

Following the 22 February hearing Judge Fisher ruled on 3 March that the approach taken by the Prudential Authority to remove Ram as curator was not the correct one and that the application failed for lack of urgency. Fisher said that the matter would be more properly addressed at the matter's next hearing on 22 March when Judge Fiona Dippenaar would hear arguments on whether the curatorship should remain in place.

Fisher noted that further written and oral submissions would be needed to determine whether Ram was in fact suitable to remain as curator.

Breakdown

The Prudential Authority's 12 March affidavit details the total breakdown of the relationship between Ram and her BDO colleagues and the regulator.

On 24 February Ram instructed 3Sixty Life's IT provider — the Numsa-owned UIPlay — to revoke the BDO team's access to 3Sixty Life's emails. This is followed the next day by the repeal of their access to 3Sixty Life's payroll and secure file transfer service.

According to a 4 March lawyers' letter from BDO to Ram Ram also forbade 3Sixty Life employees from contacting any member of the BDO team.

She demanded that the team from BDO that was working on the curatorship be replaced.

The team continued to try to work with her to no avail but without success. The terms of her suspension allowed her to continue to freely contact BDO employees work from BDO's offices and access BDO's internal computer systems. She also had a direct line to BDO's CEO Mark Stewart if she encountered any obstacles to discharging her work as curator.

In early March BDO offered Ram the use of a conference room at a hotel — and made explicit mention that this cost would be borne by the firm – as a neutral location for Ram and the team to work from. Ram declined.

On 7 March Ram ""had a black out at home"" was admitted to Sandton Mediclinic and discharged on the same evening. Unable to work and booked off until 14 March she handed over curatorship duties to Marnus Fourie a partner at BDO and head of their insurance desk. Fourie had been processing claims for 3SixtyLife since late January and had had access to the email system until it was blocked by Ram.

On 8 March Fourie tried to get back his access to 3Sixty Life's email server to perform his new duties. This was blocked by Ram though she was on sick leave. She said Fourie should send any request for emails through Ronelle Brits head of UIPlay 3Sixty Life's IT provider and fellow member of Numsa's stable of companies.

Following a visit to her doctor Ram's sick leave was extended from 14 March to 31 March ""as a result of a seizure disorder which onset was caused by these proceedings"" according to Ram's 18 March affidavit.

However Ram was well enough to provide the court with her final report just after its 15 March deadline had passed. This again argues that curatorship is not needed and that the internal recapitalisation plan — the transfer of property from parent company Doves to 3Sixty Life — was sufficient to restore the insurer to a solvent position. BDO's own findings were not included in Ram's report but attached with her comment that she disagreed with them.

Ram's secret releases

On 11 March the BDO team that had been working on the curatorship case came across emails sent from Ram's BDO email account to Micah Reddy a journalist at AmaBhungane.

Ram had used her company email to forward a number of confidential documents related to the curatorship to Reddy between 1 and 11 February. These emails all related to malfeasance at 3Sixty Life that Ram had been discovering during her term as curator. The picture she painted then was of a company in crisis.

The discovery of the emails prompted BDO to take further disciplinary action against Ram. The leaking of confidential documents to the press by a person entrusted with the rescue of a company in distress was in BDO's view an unacceptable breach of ethics. She was suspended by BDO on 16 March.

On 22 March Judge Dippenaar heard arguments in the curatorship matter. Judgment was reserved.",,,,,,,,,

I’ll be publishing this every Sunday so in between posts be sure to listen to the Equity podcast and hear Alex Wilhelm Natasha Mascarenhas and me riff on all things startups! And if you want to have this hit your inbox directly once it officially turns into a newsletter on May 1 sign up here.

Fintech M&A hasn’t been as robust as one might expect in recent months. So when Goldman Sachs announced this week it was buying NextCapital — a fintech company that provides automated advice to corporate retirement plan participants — my ears perked up.

NextCapital was a fintech company before fintech became cool. Founded in 2013 (or 2014 depending on the source) the Chicago-based company has raised over $82 million in funding over its lifetime from investors such as FinTech Collective and Oak HC/FT according to Crunchbase.

In a statement Luke Sarsfield co-head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management said: “Employers are looking to provide their employees tailored solutions and customizable advice that can better support individual saving and investing needs to help improve retirement savings outcomes. We believe personalization represents the future of retirement savings and will drive the next wave of innovative retirement solutions.”

The move is an interesting one as the investment giant has for years been strategically scooping up fintech companies. Again according to Crunchbase Goldman Sachs has acquired 27 companies over time. Last September it announced it was acquiring buy now buy later fintech GreenSky for $2.24 billion in an all-stock deal that was a reflection of its continued push into consumer finance. That deal closed last week.

In the case of NextCapital which uses algorithms and automation to allow users to invest in retirement funds Goldman didn’t say how much it was shelling out. But CNBC reported that “the acquisition ranks among the top five asset management deals New York-based Goldman has done according to the Financial Times.”

It’s another example of an incumbent recognizing that it makes more sense to buy a company that has developed technology that it wants rather than building it out itself — a process that would take far longer and require more resources than a simple acquisition would.

Early investor FinTech Collective said it backed NextCapital at a time when robo advisors were just coming to market.

“We felt that the underlying infrastructure supporting the shift from investment product to digital advice was a more durable interesting space to be allocating capital to” the firm said in a recent newsletter.

It also noted that Goldman’s intent to buy NextCapital “follows several moves by multiline incumbents (e.g. Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan) to diversify into steadier income streams and to build out their own stacks in wealth and asset management.”

Over the years Crunchbase data indicates that Goldman has also invested in more than 900 companies and led 343 of those investments. At the height of the dot.com boom in the first quarter of 2000 the bank had invested in a record 53 startups. In Q2 of 2000 that number dipped slightly to 46. And of course by Q3 it had plunged to just 13.

Its investment activity started picking up again starting in late 2018 and the bank backed 30 startups in the fourth quarter of 2019 alone. In Q1 of this year it wrote checks to 17 companies according to Crunchbase data including to a few that TechCrunch has covered including corporate spend startup Ramp tech-enabled homebuilder Homebound and Indian food delivery giant Swiggy.

I for one will be curious to see who else Goldman backs or buys in Q2.

Fast slows its roll

Last week The Information published a piece revealing that Fast which offers a one-click checkout service for online merchants generated just $600000 in revenue in 2021. Its biggest competitor Bolt raised “roughly 50 times that figure” according to The Information.

TechCrunch last reported on Fast in January of 2021 when the startup raised a $102 million Series B financing led by Stripe. Other backers include Index Ventures Susa Ventures and Global Founders Capital. When it tried later in the year to raise a $100 million Series C financing at a valuation of over $1 billion it didn’t find any takers according to the Information.

But wait there’s more. The publication went on to report on April 1 (and no it was not an April Fool’s joke) that Fast was seeking a buyer after its failed fundraise attempt.

Reportedly the startup hired about 400 employees last year and burned through about $10 million a month for most of that period; $600000 divided by 12 = $50000 in revenue a month. Spending $10 million a month when your product is only generating $50000 in the same time frame doesn’t seem smart. As my extremely talented colleague Ingrid Lunden put it: “This is the story for a lot of startups but maybe particularly ironic when it’s a fintech startup built to process and make money…A lot of these payment companies are built precisely on economies of scale. Margins are super thin on the transactions and the tech costs a lot to build and operate which is why growth/reach/size matter.”

Add to this equation a CEO — Domm Holland — who is known for his “brash style” and had his share of controversy in Australia prior to starting Fast. Holland’s former startup Tow.com.au which aimed to be “the Uber of towing” failed in what at least one person described as a “disaster.” In February NPR published an article noting that Holland’s previous venture was embroiled “in a multimillion-dollar billing dispute with the Australian state government over towing and impounding fees that led to the startup’s liquidation in 2018.”

It added that “the way Holland has rewritten and polished his past raises questions about how far the envelope can be pushed before crossing ethical lines.”

Also according to NPR as Ilya Strebulaev a professor of finance who studies the venture capital industry at Stanford University told NPR: “Failure is not a curse. But what’s important is how the failure happened.”

So what’s next for Fast? Will Holland resign? Will Bolt scoop it up? Or will some retailer just buy its technology? Or will it just die a slow death?

TechCrunch reached out to Fast for comment. It had not responded by the time of writing.

Fundings across the globe

Funding activity seemed to pick up some this week although still not as crazy as it felt last year.

Here’s just a trio that I covered:

I got the scoop on Cross River Bank raising $620 million in a round co-led by Andreessen Horowitz — going from “tiny to mighty with a $3B+ valuation and a crypto-first strategy.”

Cross River Bank is not just any bank. The Fort Lee New Jersey-based institution is also a technology infrastructure provider that quietly powers lending and payments for many of the fintechs that top VCs are also backing — a reverse of sorts of the more common fintech-powering-bank dynamic we’re used to. As fintech has exploded in recent years so has Cross River Bank’s business — as well as investor interest.

Founder and CEO Gilles Gade told me the company which powers the likes of Affirm and Coinbase views crypto as front and center of its future efforts. Profitable since 2010 the bank is also ready for an international expansion.

Notably David George general partner of the Growth Fund at Andreessen Horowitz told TechCrunch:

When Coinbase was first starting out and looking for a partner bank many traditional financial institutions had blanket policies that prevented them from participating in crypto. Cross River on the other hand had the foresight to lean into this new frontier and support Coinbase and many other leading crypto companies who are still happy partners to this day.

I also got the exclusive on a trio of Palantir alums who just raised $25 million in a Series B led by Founders Fund for their new finance startup Mosaic. This is interesting because both Palantir and Founders Fund were co-founded by Peter Thiel.

“Mosaic is born out of our experience as CFOs and as domain experts over the past decade” CEO Bijan Moallemi said. “We are trying to create a Strategic Finance category. If you think about the way that CFOs do their work 80% of their time is mostly manual right? It’s pulling down data from disparate systems it’s doing ad hoc Excel formulas it’s often one-off analyses. Only 20% of their time is more strategic making an impact on the business.”

Mosaic wants to flip that ratio on its head.

Meanwhile I also wrote about January which wants to use technology to make debt collection a more humane and efficient process. That company just raised $10 million to keep growing.

“We started off by solving the really really hard problem of how do you collect at scale in a really compliant manner or really compassionate but still really effective manner and that enabled us to solve some of the larger problems in the industry” CEO Jake Cahan told TechCrunch. “We have to stop treating individuals like criminals and start making the system work because debt isn’t going away.”

And here’s more that either my awesome colleagues wrote or that I thought were interesting but just couldn’t get to:

Yonder a U.K.-based fintech founded in 2021 raised £20 million ($26 million) in a round led by Northzone and LocalGlobe to bring its lifestyle credit card to market. The company says its vision is to “rebuild customers’ relationship with credit.” Its three co-founders are Clearscore alumni who have pulled in talent from (Transfer)Wise and Monzo to build out Yonder’s team.

CEO Tim Chong came up with the concept soon after he moved to the U.K. from Australia and attempted to apply for a credit card. Despite having a “solid” credit history back home the best he could qualify for was an Amex with a “child-safe” credit limit and hefty fees. Yonder’s first aim is to solve the problem of access to credit cards for expats and anyone with a thin credit file with a sign-up process and credit suitability evaluation based on transaction history from daily spending habits instead of relying entirely on traditional credit checks which Chong feels are discriminatory.

Payments and infrastructure oh my

From the wonderful and oh-so-talented Christine Hall: Payment cards provider CarbonPay which focuses on sustainability now has a corporate prepaid offering called CarbonPay Business Ctrl. Visa and Stripe are powering the card and businesses can get physical cards lodge cards or virtual cards and pay using ApplePay and GooglePay in the U.S.

Whenever company employees in the U.S. and U.K. use the card their carbon footprint is offset automatically. For example for every £1 or $1.50 spent CarbonPay says it will offset 1 kilogram of carbon dioxide at no extra cost. The company keeps track of carbon footprints through a partnership with sustainability-as-a-service company ecolytiq.

Later this year CarbonPay plans to unveil another business card option and personal card offering

Our own Romain Dillet reported on how ​​Visa surprised the European fintech industry last year when it announced that it would acquire Tink for €1.8 billion ($2.15 billion at the time of the deal). Klarna now wants to compete directly with Tink with a new business unit that has its own brand — Klarna Kosma.

Like Tink Klarna offers an open banking application programming interface (API) with Klarna Kosma. Tink and Klarna are also both headquartered in Stockholm Sweden. There are other open banking API companies such as TrueLayer and Plaid. And it’s been a competitive space as Visa also tried to acquire Plaid but that deal fell through.

With this new strategy Klarna is essentially saying that it’s open for business. If you’re building a financial product and need to interact with bank accounts you have one more option.

Also Fortune reported that payments giant Adyen on March 31 announced that it is moving into providing banking services — making it a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) provider. Alex Wilhelm and I talked about how this is another example of how so many companies are realizing the value of providing infrastructure. In this case Adyen says it is launching a suite of embedded financial products that will allow platforms and marketplaces to create tailored financial experiences for their users including small business owners and individual merchants. As Alex put it: “Stripe did this but now everyone is coming for banking infra I think as a way to drive more enterprise software revenues and get away from consumer incomes.”

Meanwhile fellow fintech enthusiast Ron Shevlin in February summed it up nicely in a recent Forbes piece writing that “the rise of interest in banking as a service is the result of the growing embedded finance trend.”

In other infrastructure news…

Plaid’s CTO detailed to Ron Miller how he grew his engineering team by 17.5x in 4 years.

Cross-border payments platform dLocal is one of the most notable Latin American startups in recent history — the company became Uruguay’s first unicorn in 2020 and went public on the Nasdaq in 2021. DLocal’s founders had first launched AstroPay another digital payments platform that now has over five million users.

Now dLocal and AstroPay co-founder Sergio Fogel has teamed up with AstroPay’s former head of product Gonzalo Strauss to launch another fintech out of Montevideo Uruguay called Datanomik. Datanomik’s goal is to connect financial institutions across LatAm through its B2B open finance API which gathers a company’s banking information on one platform Strauss told TechCrunch as told by Anita Ramaswamy who is starting a crypto-focused podcast with Lucas Matney (exciting!).

As the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues one fintech startup is doing its part to help people being affected by the war.

Igor Khmel is CEO of SaveChain a new neobank for underbanked people globally to open U.S. bank accounts. Khmel tells TechCrunch that while SaveChain is still in its infancy (the company plans to launch its app by July) he wants to use its technology to help Ukrainians now by powering a new fintech-humanitarian initiative called HelpUkrainedirect which provides “Temporary Basic Income” to Ukrainian refugees via direct donations in crypto and USD.

Through its initiative HelpUkraineDirect (HUD) the company says its goal is to provide Ukrainians with direct financial relief leveraging blockchain technology and existing banking and volunteer infrastructure to pioneer a “Temporary Basic Income” (TBI) scheme for refugees via direct donor-to-refugee money distribution. The aim is to provide hard-pressed individuals with $100/month for 3-6 months according to Khmel. Crypto and tax-deductible donations can be made at https://HelpUkraineDirect.org.

Photo: PTC

Like a warm summer breeze Fireflies slips into Pioneer Theatre Company’s season as a breather between the boisterous exclamation-pointed musicals Something Rotten! and Hello Dolly!

Fireflies is what you might get if Enchanted April were a sitcom. (Both are from novels adapted for the stage by playwright Matthew Barber.) Friday night’s Utah premiere was underscored by a steady beat of chuckles as the audience relaxed into the gentle tale of late-life romance set in small-town Texas near the turn of the 21st century.

The story takes place over roughly a week in the life of Eleanor Bannister a retired English teacher whose world is upended when drifter Abel Brown shows up and offers to renovate her nearby rental property in exchange for a place to stay.

What draws these mismatched souls together? We can easily surmise because the tropes are so familiar: set-in-her-ways schoolmarm meets mysterious free spirit; misunderstandings ensue; the odd couple learn from each other and fall in love.

But aside from an amusing but out-of-left-field dream/flashback sequence in which Eleanor visits a dinosaur museum and identifies a little too closely with the prehistoric creatures the script largely lets those tropes do the work for it. Occasionally an intriguing idea will pop up. (Why does a discussion of her late parents’ “honeymoon cottage” trigger Eleanor so violently?) But like the insects of the title the idea flashes briefly and is gone. Thus it falls to the four actors to carry the day.

Joy Franz channels the late Betty White’s sass-tinged sweetness in her portrayal of Eleanor. She bristles with indignation whenever she hears the English language being misused and she endures nosy neighbor Grace Bodell’s nonstop chatter with barely suppressed annoyance. When Eleanor softens as we know she must the audience reacts with a sigh of satisfaction.

Joy Lynn Jacobs plays the meddlesome Grace Eleanor’s best friend by default. The role appears to be written as comic relief but Jacobs and director Kareem Fahmy wisely lean harder into Grace’s friendly concern for Eleanor. Jacobs always found warmth behind the one-liners. She also earned Friday night’s biggest laugh with her spot-on timing: “There are many things I’d like to say to you Mr. Brown but I’m a Christian woman so I’m not going to say them … to your face.”

David Manis balances bluster and vulnerability as Abel. He takes an instant liking to Eleanor and is eager to please her but Manis delivers his lines with just enough ambiguity—a telling hesitation here and there—that the audience can share in Grace’s suspicion.

Salt Lake City-based actor Tito Livas makes a brief but endearing appearance as police officer Eugene Claymire a former student of Eleanor’s.

The script of Fireflies tends to tell more than show but the moment when Eugene begins to recite a poem Eleanor taught him is a delightful exception illustrating the lasting impact a good teacher can have.

Pioneer’s production is a handsome one. Paige Hathaway designed Eleanor’s cozy and inviting kitchen where all the action takes place. Brenda Van der Wiel’s costuming also deserves special mention as the clothing choices—Grace’s crayon-pink church suit and royal blue capris; Eleanor’s retro-cool dress and sturdy shoes; Abel’s progressively tidier jeans-and-shirt ensembles—wordlessly reveal the wearers’ personalities.

Fireflies runs through April 16 at the Roy W. and Elizabeth E. Simmons Pioneer Memorial Theatre. pioneertheatre.org.

Miss Punjaban Row: PTC strongly counters sexual exploitation charges; announces reward for proving link with main accused Nancy Ghuman ( Watch Video)

Categorically denied any link with main accused Nancy Ghuman

PTC announces a reward of Rs One Lakh to prove a link between Nancy Ghuman / Bhupinder Singh with company

Babushahi Bureau

Chandigarh March 2 2022: PTC Network which is under sharp attack by the Sikh Groups amid the ongoing sexual exploitation case has tried to counter the allegation by claiming no connection with Nancy Ghuman the main accused in the case. It has also announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh to prove a link between Nancy Ghuman with the company.

It may be mentioned that there is a lot of hues and cry to act against PTC Punjabi from many circles particularly some Sikh organizations and personalities demanding to stop the Gurbani Telacast from Harimandir Sahib by PTC keeping in view the allegations of sexual exploitation on the channel.

The contestant alleged confinement by the reality show organizers and sexual harassment by the management of the media company.

She also claimed that when she complained about the harassment the organizers threatened her that she can't leave the premises and quit as per her agreement with the company.

In her FIR she also complained that the show organizers make illicit videos of girls and force them into the sex trade. She also mentioned that the organizers attempted to sexually exploit her. The complainant further alleged that organizers demanded Rs 12 to 15 lakhs or sexual favors for making her part of the reality show.

The contestant added that girls' drinks were spiked by the organizers and they were locked in the room. Based on her complaint FIR was lodged in Mohali Police station on April 17. SSP Mohali has formed an SIT to inquire about the case.

The complainant filed a Habeas Corpus through her father in Punjab and Haryana High Court seeking the release of her ""illegal custody"" by the reality show organizers. The father also alleged that some senior functionaries were pressurizing her for sexual favors.

Acting on the plea the Punjab and Haryana High Court bench directed the registry to appoint a warrant officer. The court further directed that the warrant officer is to visit the premises in question and get the girl released. The officer was also asked to submit a report on March 17.

In a communication sent to SSP Mohali in response to the charges the PTC Network has claimed that the entire content of the complaint is false malicious and is made with an intent to harm the reputation of the organization.

PTC Network further stated that the main accused in the FIR namely Nancy Ghuman and Bhupinder Singh are not their employees.

The PTC Punjabi also announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh to anyone proving the link between PTC and Nancy Ghuman and Bhupinder Singh who is the main accused in the FIR.

""They are neither associated with us in any manner nor known to us. It should be investigated who these persons are and why they have been named the main accused in our organization"" stated the communication sent by PTC Network to SSP Mohali.

The company expressed that it is shocked at the ""baseless and false"" allegation made against them after having a track record of organizing talent shows and contests with the regularity of 13 years. It further claimed that never before such allegations have been leveled against the company.

On the allegation of confinement made by one of their female contestants the media network said that the complainant had free access to her mobile phone and was free to meet visitors from her family at any time with prior written intimation.

Sub: False FIR number 0002 dated 17.03.2022 in PS Women against PTC Network organisation and its employees

Dear Sir

It has come to our notice that an FIR (mentioned above) has been registered against us under your jurisdiction.

Please note:

1. That the entire contents based on the complaint of one Ms Rajvir Kaur d/o Gian Singh are false malicious and with intent to harm the reputation of our organisation.

2. That the main accused in the FIR namely Nancy Ghuman and Bhupinder Singh are not our employees. They are neither associated with us in any manner nor known to us. It should be investigated who these persons are and why they have been named main accused in our organisation.

3. That we have been fully co operating with your staff who visited us at oyr premises and we intend to extend full co operation .

4. That we are handing over our DVR machine with hard disk to your staff for proper study and investigation.

5. That we have provided free access to your staff to meet and record statements of rest of the contestants in a highly amicable and independent atmosphere.

6. That we are shocked at the baseless and false allegations against our organisation which has a track record of organising talent shows and contests with regularity for the last 13 years and never before any allegation of any wrong doing has been levelled. Most of our core team handling the show has been with the company for over a decade and have never faced any allegation of any nature whatsoever.

7. That we are unable to understand why the complainant levelled such allegations against our organisation whereas she had free access to her mobile phone and was free to meet visitors from her family at any time with prior written intimation.

8. That the complainant has been meeting outsiders despite giving written undertaking not to interact with outsiders or step out of the premises without intimation and written approval. This fact can be verified through CCTV footage handed over to your staff already.

9. That the complainant was free to call 100 or Women helpline at any time that she felt uncomfortable if ever. She never made any complaint to anyone.

10. That she was constantly in touch with her parents on phone and could have easily asked to be rescued if she ever felt any threat.

11. That she filed a Habeas Corpus through her father with the High Court to be rescued from our alleged confinement. It is very strange to note that a person in duress and under life threat would not call the polie or family but wait for Hon’ble High Court to appoint a Warrant Officer and then wait for 24 hours for the Warrant Officer to come and rescue her.

12. That a person avoiding calling the police and Women Helpline despite herself being a lawyer looks certain to have ulterior motives and for sure was under no threat or confinement.

13. That it is a fact that she always had her hotel room key in her possession and could have come and gone at her will and there was never any provision to bar any girl from going out of her room ever.

14. That keeping in view the above facts and many more that will come to light under your investigation we submit this representation to your good office to ensure a free and fair probe in the matter as we fear that this FIR has been lodged with an ulterior motive to damage the reputation of the global television network - PTC Network - which is the number one Punjabi television network all over the world and prides itself for propagating the cause of Punjab Punjabi and Punjabiyat.

Best regards

Update. Additional HYCU views added. 5 April 2022.

HYCU presented its update to a March IT Press Tour in Tel Aviv reminding attendees it began its life providing Nutanix-focussed backup then added VMware and subsequently added the Google Azure and AWS public clouds in that order with an agentless backup-as-a-service offering. Office 365 was supported in February last year and Kubernetes-orchestrated cloud-native workloads in April.

Subbiah Sundaram.

Subbiah Sundaram VP of product for HYCU told attendees: “We integrate with Isilon’s native API not using NDMP whose use impacts production systems. Ours does not.”

That’s because NDMP uses host server CPU and memory resources whereas HYCU’s agentless backup does not. HYCU’s Protégé software can backup Isilon and PowerScale systems to on-premises Data Domain and ECS targets but also to the three top public clouds. In this way it can aid a customer’s migration to the cloud.

When it was mentioned that Druva can also backup source systems to the public cloud and Dell has a tie-up with Druva HYCU SBP sales Justin Endres said that Druva was AWS-specific and customers would prefer multi-cloud support. He also suggested that Dell-Druva deal was done in haste and Dell might be looking to widen its SaaS backup supplier relationship so as to gain multi-cloud target support.

Endres also said that Isilon/PowerScale customers moved to HYCU because relying on replica copy-based rather than backup-based protection didn’t scale well or extend easily to the public cloud. HYCU fulfils both requirements. Also Isilon customers came to HYCU because extending their legacy backup to the cloud was hard and HYCU made it easier. Commvault and Veritas were singled out in this regard with Sundaram saying Commvault’s Metallic does not protect Isilon.

Other features in the March update were:

Expanded WORM (Write Once Read Many) support including S3 object lock and its equivalent for Azure Blob and Google Cloud Object Storage;

Zero trust security with partners offering services after education by HYCU;

Migration from on-premises backups to the to Azure Government Cloud.

HYCU Azure Government Cloud slide.

Asked if HYCU offered dedupe in the cloud Sundaram said: “We don’t do dedupe in the cloud. It requires compute there and compute is expensive while storage and networking are cheaper. We only ship unique blocks to the cloud with a first fill backup and only unique blocks from incremental changes.” This is marketed as Cloud Smart with savings in backup storage capacity and faster recovery than restoration from a deduplicated backup store in the cloud. In effect HYCU gets dedupe done on the source system.

In the future HYCU could introduce data protection plus security with integration of its software with the native security management of the source platform so it could work with the identity management features there.

HYCU has an R-Score ransomware attack readiness score with a 0 to 1000 rating and offers it as a free service to customers. It was created with help from Mandiant and so far it has been used more than 50000 times.

HYCU presentation slide.

It’s enabling its partners to offer this as a service with partners billing customers for its use. HYCU says this gives its partners something to compete against Google with its acquired Mandiant offering.

A HYCU spokesperson told us: “These new services for us are just a small but hopefully meaningful way in which our partners can add ransomware assessment to their ongoing practice areas – especially for those in that have security service and practice areas. I honestly don’t think any of us would ever think those capabilities for midsize enterprise-focused MSPs/MSSPs and CSPs would ever run up against the breadth and depth of what Mandiant currently offers and may offer now that they’re a part of Google. We still work with the Mandiant execs and engineers to fine tune R-Score that we introduced with them last August as well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyaW15Z29vZHMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMDIvaGFuYS12dS1tYWtlcy1yYXB0dXJpemluZy1oZWFkbGluaW5nLWRlYnV0LWF0LXRoZS1tb3JvY2Nhbi1sb3VuZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hana Vu makes rapturizing headlining debut at the Moroccan Lounge,"Hana Vu at the Moroccan Lounge by Steven Ward

Making her headlining debut at the Moroccan Lounge Hana Vu bathed the sold-out crowd in wave after wave of her kinetically existential songs. It would be a criminally short set with no encore (something she was upfront about from the beginning though you can appreciate her desire to not go through the nonsense of leaving the stage only to be cheered back on). All of which were probably symptoms of the fact there was a later show taking place after Hana Vu finished. But for the time she was onstage the 22-year-old and her band gave a kind of swift pummeling of the senses ego and soul. One that rapturized this sense amongst everyone present that Vu just tapped into something unspoken.

Playing majorly from her debut the viscerally introspective Public Space Vu’s music disarms with just how melodically jumbled it is. Mixing the peripheries of angsty rock swirling pop hooks and linking them together in jarring but spellbinding soundscapes. It’s the disco spin of “Aubade” and the devilishly melancholic “Everybody’s Birthday” the kind of jaunty music you weep over the lyrics as well as dance to. Not a body went unmoved while Hana Vu was onstage nor a heart unbroken.

Hana Vu at the Moroccan Lounge by Steven Ward

It’s no mistake that the album cover for Public Space is a high-contrast close-up of Vu’s mouth. Her songs mined voraciously from her own life. So it’s no surprise that every song plucked from the album to play at the Moroccan Lounge thundered in your head and left goosebumps on your skin an effect repeated evermore when listening to Vu’s music. From the shuddering lurches of “My Home” and “Maker” to the anthemic collapses of hammered riffs that drop on the title track “Public Storage.” It was via that last song that Vu launched her finale. One that buckles under its burningly potent declarations of disbelief (in failure family magic) searing pessimism and intense solipsism. But against and paradoxically in tandem with Hana Vu’s crushing lyricism the song’s invigorating chorus – a plea to “Everyone’s champion” an unnamed hero of the time perhaps so because they do not exist – found some nerve to gush hope from as it all exploded in a crescendo.

Langley will get a new five-storey self-storage depot although Township councillors debated whether it was a good use of scarce industrial land at a council meeting on Monday March 28.

The property in the 20500 block of 64th Avenue is zoned for industrial use and self-storage is one of the permitted uses.

“I still come back to the question is five storeys of storage the best use for this land?” said Councillor Kim Richter.

She said it did not fit in for the site.

“It is on an industrial site and so what I think we need to do is review what’s allowable in our industrial areas” said Coun. Petrina Arnason.

“We all know there’s a crisis and shortage of industrial land” Arnason added saying that was why she could not support it.

The shortage of industrial land has been a topic of debate in the Lower Mainland especially around the approval of the South Campbell Heights lands on the Langley-Surrey border becoming industrial land. The narrow vote at the Metro Vancouver board approving the land use change was highly controversial.

“I think it’s a brilliant use of the land because the way storage units are traditionally built they’re all sprawled out with little tiny garages” said Coun. Bob Long.

He said this one won’t do that because of its height noting the design includes eight elevators.

“If you can’t do it on industrial land where would you do it?” he added.

Arnason and Richter voted against the project but the rest of the council was in favour and it passed.",,,

The 500-plus guests that poured into the Cotton Holdings tent during the World’s Championship Bar-B-Que Contest at NRG Park were just as stunned by the swank Ralph Lauren-inspired decor as they were by the surprise entertainment Grammy-nominated country western band Midland.

Sure the barbecue cook-off teams competing during that first weekend of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo are known for creating special environments for their guests. But the “Cotton Q Club” was so over the top that those guests are still swooning.

Think crystal and antler chandeliers tartan plaid flooring leather and brass seating thousands of red roses and a cascade of red roses falling from the 50-foot bar. It was a rich combo of western chic and equestrian esthetics the latter played out in bars tufted in green velvet polo helmets on display and two 7-foot tall white mosaic horses. The stage where entertainment performed nightly during the cook-off was built of emerald green ship lap and tufted green velvet.

As CEO of multi-faceted Cotton Holdings Pete Bell wanted the firm’s first year as title sponsor of the barbecue competition to be a memorable one. This opening night party hosted by Cotton and Quanta Services was indeed one to remember.

Design and execution of the 9000 square foot tent paneled in cedar shakes and the sophisticated decor were in the able hands of the Cotton team. Under its wide umbrella the company provides property restoration and recovery construction roofing consulting temporary workforce housing and culinary services to public and private entities worldwide.

In fact Cotton Culinary led by executive chef Wade Schindler not only provided party foods and a full barbecue dinner for the throng but also won three HLSR awards. Cotton’s chefs took the People’s Choice Grand Champion honors at Rodeo Uncorked! Roundup & Best Bites competition second place in the Open Contest category at the World’s Championship Bar-B-Que Contest and Best Façade at the cook-off.

This chipset could well be branded as the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 may lock horns with the MediaTek Dimensity 8100 and looks set to be built with the same ARM architecture as current-gen flagship SoCs like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and MediaTek Dimensity 9000.

4 Reviews

After debuting the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 back in December Qualcomm finally looks set to bring a sub-premium chipset to the market. While it's currently unconfirmed what moniker the SoC will bear rumors indicate it could be the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 and a new leak has now provided some important details.

As revealed by Digital Chat Station the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1—as it will be referred to until further information on the contrary surfaces—will be an octa-core chipset with four Cortex-A710 cores and four Cortex-A510 cores. That means it will adopt ARM's V9 architecture as seen on chipset like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 MediaTek Dimensity 9000 and Exynos 2200 albeit without a Cortex-X2 super core.

On the GPU end the new chipset is said to feature an Adreno 662. One can assume that to be a direct successor to the Adreno 660 on the Snapdragon 888 although Qualcomm's naming scheme isn't always as straightforward as should be expected.

Naturally the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1's closest rival seems to be the MediaTek Dimensity 8100 a chipset that surprisingly betters last year's Snapdragon 888 in performance and efficiency. The Dimensity 8100 looks to be at a disadvantage as it uses older architecture in the form of Cortex-A78 and Cortex-A55 cores. Newer isn't always better though especially as ARM's current Cortex-A710 cores have displayed slightly worse efficiency than the older Cortex-A78 cores.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemJvdC5jb20vbW9iaWxlL25ld3MvcXVhbGNvbW0tc25hcGRyYWdvbi03NzhnLXZzLWV4eW5vcy0xMjgwLTA3OTk5Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G Vs Exynos 1280: Almost Similar?,"Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G Vs Exynos 1280: Almost Similar? News oi -Vivek

The Samsung Galaxy A73 5G and the Samsung Galaxy A53 5G are finally here. Although these are identical-looking smartphones there are two major differences between these devices. The primary difference between these devices is the camera. The more expensive Galaxy A73 5G has a 108MP primary camera while the Galaxy A53 5G has a 64MP primary camera.

Another important differentiator between these devices is the processor. The Samsung Galaxy A73 5G uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G SoC while the Samsung Galaxy A53 5G is based on the in-house Exynos 1280 SoC which is based on 5nm fabrication making it a bit more power-efficient than the Snapdragon 778G SoC which is based on 6nm fabrication.

Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G Vs Exynos 1280 Geekbench 5 Performance

When it comes to Geekbench the Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G outperforms the Exynos 1280 in both single-core and multi-core CPU tests. However if you look at the numbers they are actually not that far away from each other. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G is around 10 percent more powerful than the Exynos 1280 SoC.

Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G Vs Exynos 1280 AnTuTu Performance

AnTuTu is a holistic benchmark platform that tests the CPU GPU and APU capabilities of the processor. On the AnTuTu benchmark the Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G SoC posts over five lakhs and thirty thousand points (530000) while the Exynos 1280 scores around three lakhs and eighty thousand points (380000) with a difference of around 25 percent.

Samsung Galaxy A73 5G Vs Samsung Galaxy A53 5G

These numbers clearly represent that the Samsung Galaxy A73 5G is a better device at least when it comes to holistic performance. While the CPU performance difference between the two devices is pretty negligible the Snapdragon 778G definitely has a more powerful GPU which makes the Galaxy A73 5G a better gaming smartphone.

For normal day-to-day usage both devices offer similar performance. However when it comes to gaming performance the Samsung Galaxy A73 5G is a better device. Hence if you are looking for a gaming smartphone (amongst these two) we suggest the Galaxy A783 5G which costs Rs. 41999 for the base model.

On the other hand the brand is also gearing up for the launch of the Oppo F21 Pro series in India. While it is known that the Oppo F21 Pro 4G variant will be a rebranded version of the Oppo Reno 7 4G launched in Indonesia apparently the upcoming Oppo F21 Pro 5G will be a rebranded version of the Reno 7 Lite 5G.









Now according to a report from MySmartPrice tipster Sudhanshu Ambhore has provided intel on the price specifications and colour options of the Oppo Reno 7 Lite 5G arriving in Europe. The specifications shared by the tipster are quite similar to Oppo F21 Pro 5G smartphone that is going to be launched in India on April 12. Mentioned below are the price and specification details of the Reno 7 Lite 5G smartphone being introduced in Europe.

Oppo Reno 7 Lite 5G Specs

The upcoming Oppo Reno 7 Lite 5G will come with a 6.43-inch AMOLED display with a Full HD+ resolution of 2400x1080pixels along with 409ppi pixel density and can go bright up to 600nits. The device will operate on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 695 chipset which will be coupled with up to 8GB RAM and 128GB of internal storage.

For the camera part Oppo Reno7 Lite 5G will come with a triple rear camera setup headlined by a 64MP primary sensor along with a 2MP macro and a 2MP depth sensor.

The device will be backed by a 4500mAh battery unit and will support 33W fast charging. The phone will come with a 3.5mm headphone jack and a USB-C port.

Oppo Reno 7 Lite 5G Price

It is most likely that Oppo Reno 7 Lite 5G will be launched in Europe with a single storage variant – 8GB RAM + 128GB internal storage priced around EUR 350 which is roughly about Rs 29300. The smartphone will be available in Blue and Black colour options.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHN0b3J5LmluL2NvbXBhcmlzb24tcXVhbGNvbW0tc25hcGRyYWdvbi03NzhnLXNvYy12cy1zYW1zdW5nLWV4eW5vcy0xMjgwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comparison - Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G Soc VS Samsung Exynos 1280,"The Samsung Galaxy A73 5G and Samsung Galaxy A53 5G are now available. Even though these smartphones appear to be similar there are two significant discrepancies between them.

The camera is the key distinction between these gadgets. The Galaxy A53 5G features a 64MP primary camera while the Galaxy A73 5G has a 108MP primary camera.

The CPU is another significant difference between these devices. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G SoC is used in the Samsung Galaxy A73 5G whereas the Exynos 1280 SoC used in the Samsung Galaxy A53 5G is based on 5nm manufacture making it somewhat more power-efficient than the Snapdragon 778G SoC which is based on 6nm production.

Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G Vs Samsung Exynos 1280 – Geekbench Comparison

The Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G outperforms the Exynos 1280 in both single-core and multi-core CPU tests on Geekbench. However when you look at the figures you can see that they aren’t that far apart.

The Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G SoC outperforms the Exynos 1280 SoC by around 10%.

Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G Vs Samsung Exynos 1280 – AnTuTu Comparison

AnTuTu is a comprehensive benchmark platform that evaluates the processor’s CPU GPU and APU capabilities.

The Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G SoC scores over five lakhs and thirty thousand points (530000) on the AnTuTu benchmark whereas the Exynos 1280 scores approximately three lakhs and eighty thousand points (380000) a difference of around 25%.

Samsung Galaxy A73 5G compared with Samsung Galaxy A53 5G

These figures clearly show that the Samsung Galaxy A73 5G is a superior handset at least in terms of overall performance. While the difference in CPU speed between the two handsets is minor the Snapdragon 778G has a more powerful GPU making the Galaxy A73 5G a superior gaming smartphone.

Both gadgets provide comparable performance in routine day-to-day use. When it comes to gaming performance though the Samsung Galaxy A73 5G is superior.

As a result if you’re looking for a gaming smartphone (among these two) we recommend the Samsung Galaxy A783 5G which starts at Rs. 41999 for the basic variant.

Conclusion:

Looking at the comparison it is evident that Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets have consistently outperformed Samsung’s in-house Exynos chipsets in all categories including Geekbench and Antutu.

The smartphones that may be compared are the Samsung A535G which has an Exynos 1280 processor and the Samsung A73 5G which has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G chipset.

And based on the pricing it’s clear that the processor within the A53 5G isn’t as powerful as the one inside the A73 5G even if the price difference isn’t significant.

While many people may not be familiar with the name Outdoor America Images chances are they’ve seen OAI’s work which is prominently displayed at popular Bay Area venues.

""Most of the stuff you see around Tampa is done by OAI especially around the Bucs stadium"" shared Chris Barnes grand format and dye sub-manager at OAI.

OAI mainly focuses on billboards but they produce materials for a lot of sporting events as well. Many signs fans see at the Bucs Lightning Rowdies and Rays games are done by OAI.

""We do every part of the stadium"" Barnes stated. ""The big murals on the outside those are each 85 feet by 83 and there's four of them.""

OAI has three 16-foot grand format printers to produce the images.

""We just produce them every week every month whenever an event happens"" Barnes said. ""They print up to 16-feet wide and you print them in panels. We have a heat-sealing welder machine that welds these panels together and it creates a giant wall mural.""

When the SEC Tournament was held at Amalie Arena in February the exterior was decorated with OAI's work which often requires flexibility and a quick turnover time.

""Two of our clients are the Bucs and USF so we're flipping a stadium within 24 hours"" explained Kristina Lausier OAI sales account manager. ""USF has a game on Saturday and we're flipping that stadium for the Bucs on Sunday.""

While they are visually known for their many sports banners OAI has also lined the Riverwalk with banners and signs. The company can wrap a vehicle with a logo an ad or a sports message. It can also transform a personal indoor or outdoor home area with a total wall print without the need to bring in a professional painting team.

""We're getting hit from all angles but we have a 40000 square foot facility here and we're able to make it work"" shared Lausier.

""We're doing everything"" she added. ""I think that's the really cool part to see a project come to fruition from the very start to the very end. Transforming stadiums you know from a Bucs stadium to a wrestling arena for Wrestlemania.""

OAI’s work can be seen all over the nation and all around the Bay Area from the street signs on every light pole downtown to Clearwater Marine Aquarium's ""Legends of the Deep"" display.

""We did the Super Bowl which was huge"" exclaimed Lausier. ""In those scenarios too where we were having to print multiple teams and then the championship winner we pull out that banner at the end.""

For all of the visual majesty that their work brings to an arena venue or stadium there is a lot of work going on to make it look that way.

""Each job each billboard each banner produces a different output a different percentage of ink"" shared Barnes. ""You could go through so many liters of ink per job.""

But there's a definite upside to the work.

""Each job is different"" Barnes explained. ""We love to see our final outcome of what we do see it on TV or drive by and see it in person. It's a blast!""

At least to gamers the RTX 3090 made little sense since there was no need to have a massive 24GB VRAM buffer and despite Nvidia's best efforts 8K gaming just isn't a thing.

Unfortunately though ""boring and rather pointless"" would be a good way to summarize the entire graphics card segment over the past year and a half and you can probably include the word ""hopeless"" in there as well.

Since release and for months on end even pointless products like the RTX 3090 were nearly impossible to find unless you were willing to pay scalper prices of ~$3000 for the fastest GPUs on the market. Thankfully pricing has started to drop though in most cases it's still inflated.

You can now get an RTX 3090 starting at $1900 which is still 30% over MSRP but well down on the $3000+ prices we were faced with not that long ago.

The original RTX 3080 is currently selling for $1100 though meaning you're paying over 70% more for a 3090 for what amounts to 10-15% more performance at 4K.

You may want to argue that the RTX 3090 isn't ""pointless"" considering it's the most affordable graphics card with a 24GB VRAM buffer. Again that's worthless to gamers but for certain production workloads the big memory buffer could be a godsend so there's that.

But what about a GeForce RTX 3090 Ti? Would a Ti version packing 2.5% more cores clocked 10% higher with 8% more memory bandwidth be useful to anyone? I guess that depends on the price. But of course it's not replacing the original version at $1500.

This isn't a refresh where you get a small boost at the same price point before the next generation arrives rather this is what we'd call a ""milking."" A small performance bump for a big price hike a hike that sees the MSRP hit $2000.

Apart from a few extra cores the 3090 Ti is just an overclocked 3090 with a ludicrously high power rating of 450 watts nearly a 30% increase over the original 3090. Is that dumb? Surely sounds like it but to be sure let's first take a look at the three RTX 3090 Ti boards we have on hand and then on to the benchmarks.

The Cards: Asus MSI and Gainward

Starting with the Asus TUF Gaming OC the RTX 3090 version was already very large but the 3090 Ti is even bigger weighing 1677 grams which isn't that crazy but the dimensions are quite something measuring 325mm long 150mm tall and a whopping 63mm wide making this a 3-slot graphics card.

Externally it looks like any other 30-series TUF Gaming graphics card. There are three 100mm fans wrapped in an aluminium shroud and on the backside you get a full size aluminium backplate. The stainless steel I/O bracket features three DisplayPort outputs and two HDMI outputs.

Getting down to the PCB we find a PCIe 5.0 16-pin power connector and since no power supplies support this connector (at least none you can buy right now) the 3090 Ti cards come with an adapter that feeds three 8-pin PCIe cables into the PCIe 5.0 16-pin power connector.

This is basically the same 12-pin connector featured on the Nvidia Founders Edition models just with four extra 'sense' pins.

The biggest upgrade for all 3090 Ti graphics cards is arguably the memory. Capacity has not changed from the original so it's still 24GB but memory density and frequency has improved upgrading the memory modules capacity from 1GB to 2GB meaning there are just 12 modules and they're all on the front side of the PCB. This will significantly improve memory cooling performance.

That also means the backplate is just extracting heat from the rear PCB and not a dozen GDDR6X chips. Asus has still included plenty of thermal pads on the backplate though using it as a heat spreader.

The heatsink is massive as you'd expect and Asus has gone with a nickel plated copper base for extracting heat from the GPU and some of GDDR6X memory which is a bit of an odd choice for the memory.

Instead most of the memory chips are connected to an aluminum plate which won't be as efficient at extracting heat. Overall a very good looking card with an excellent mounting method for connecting with the PCB.

When put to the test installed inside the Corsair Obsidian 500D in a 21C room the TUF Gaming peaked at 79C for the hot spot with a peak memory temperature of 78C. The fans spun at 2400 RPM and the cores typically clocked at 1.99 GHz out of the box.

We also tested the MSI RTX 3090 Ti Suprim X and this thing is a beast. It's without question the biggest graphics card we've ever come across taking up 4 slots with a weight of 2145 grams. It measures 305mm long and stands 140mm tall but at 71mm wide it takes up 4 slots which is complete madness.

There are three 95mm fans encased in a bonkers-looking fan shroud and at the rear is an nice looking backplate that has a lot going on. There's brushed aluminium LED backlit logos vents and a neat little black skirt a the end. Oddly though despite the massive I/O bracket which takes up 3-slots MSI has only included three DisplayPort and a single HDMI output so one less HDMI port that you get with the Asus model.

Where the Suprim X appears to be in a league of its own is cooling. Whereas the TUF Gaming was a combination of heatsink fins and aluminium brackets the Suprim X is pretty much all fins. There's 8 nickel-plated heatpipes that extend through the fin stacks. Then connecting the GPU and GDDR6X memory to the heatsink is a large nickel-plated base making contact with all 12 memory modules.

When put to the test installed inside the Corsair Obsidian 500D in a 21C room the Suprim X peaked at 88C for the hot spot with a peak memory temperature of 82C. It's worth noting that the fans spun at just 1700 RPM so the Suprim X was virtually silent. The cores also typically clocked at 1.99 GHz out of the box.

We only received the Gainward RTX 3090 Ti Phantom GS the day before our review was going live which is why we didn't include any results in our graphs. But we did have time to install it and run it for an hour for a temperature analysis.

This is another triple-slot design with three 90mm fans embedded in a plastic shroud. It's a cool looking design with some black anodized pipes that run end to end. Around the back is a full-size backplate with some air vents cut outs towards the end. This is quite a large section of the backplate as the PCB is very short.

Gainward has managed to cram their premium RTX 3090 Ti graphics card onto a 205mm long PCB which is impressive given the card itself is 310mm long. This means there is quite a large section of the card that allows air to pass through it and this should help quite a lot with cooling performance.

Like MSI Gainward has gone with a single HDMI output and three DisplayPort outputs and of course there is a single 16-pin PCIe 5.0 power connector. Now the Phantom GS is quite heavy at 1837 grams thanks to a large triple-slot cooler packing eight heatpipes and a large copper base. Gainward has been generous with the thermal pads and there's a good amount of them also found on the backplate so overall a solid looking 3090 Ti.

When put to the test inside the Obsidian 500D case in a 21C room the Phantom GS peaked at 84C for the hot spot with a peak memory temperature of 76C. These temperatures were achieved with a fan speed of 1850 RPM so in terms of cooling performance the Phantom GS is similar to the massive MSI model. The cores also typically clocked at 2 GHz.

Gaming Benchmarks

For this review we've tested 12 games at 1080p 1440p and 4K. We'll mostly focus on the 4K data but you can see the performance summary for all resolutions further down below.

All benchmarks were run using our Ryzen 9 5950X test system configured with 32GB of dual-rank dual-channel DDR4-3200 CL14 memory. Resizable Bar was not enabled as we see this as more of a platform feature that isn't suitable for individual GPU tests or at least right now it doesn't accurately represent how Radeon and GeForce GPUs compare on older systems.

Starting with Assassin's Creed Valhalla we see that both the Asus and MSI 3090 Ti models we have on hand were good for 69 fps on average making them just 3% faster than the original RTX 3090 as well as the Radeon RX 6900 XT.

Next we have Far Cry 6 and here the new 3090 Ti models are just 5% faster than the RTX 3090 Founders Edition or just 2.5% faster than the Suprim X version of the standard 3090. So we're still looking at mid to low single digit gains for the new Ti model.

Watch Dogs Legion also shows a minor 5% increase over a stock 3090 or 3% over the Suprim X version as both the MSI and Asus 3090 Ti cards rendered 66 fps on average an impressive 4K result for sure but hardly earth shattering.

The margins grow a little in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Here the 3090 Ti Suprim X was 11% faster than the 3090 FE card and 8% faster than the Suprim X version. As far as the apples to apples comparisons go the 3090 Ti is up to 8% faster than the 3090. Pretty uninspiring gains so far.

At face value the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege results look more promising with larger margins but that's mostly down to the fact that we're playing with much larger numbers here.

Still the Suprim X 3090 Ti was 3.5% faster than the Asus TUF Gaming OC model though it was only 9% faster than the older Suprim X version of the original 3090.

F1 2021 sees an 8% margin from the 3090 Suprim X to the 3090 Ti version and that seems as good as it gets for the 3090 Ti. I should also note that the Radeon GPUs look quite weak here as ray tracing is enabled by default and therefore we test with this feature enabled.

No surprises found in Horizon Zero Dawn the 3090 Ti was 5% faster than comparable 3090 models rendering 98 fps on average.

Doom Eternal was no challenge for the 3090 Ti though the same was also true of the 3090 and here the Suprim X models are separated by a mere 4% margin.

The 3090 Ti Suprim X was 11% faster than the 3090 Suprim X our biggest margin yet. Clearly this game is enjoying the higher clocked cores and memory. We're not sure you'll notice going from 123 fps to 138 fps at 4K but you'll probably notice the $500+ missing from your wallet.

Moving on there's little to see in Death Stranding here the Suprim X models are separated by just a 6% margin.

Hitman 3 risks a little excitement with a 9% margin favoring the 3090 Ti Suprim X over the 3090 model almost double digits there.

Finally we have Cyberpunk 2077 with a 10% performance boost over the Suprim X 3090. Sadly we couldn't hit 60 fps in our test using the second highest quality settings. Maybe next-gen hardware will achieve that at 4K.

Performance Summary

1080p 1440p and 4K

Based on the tests we ran it sounds like the 3090 Ti is up to 10% faster than the original 3090 at 4K. Let's now also see how the 12 game average data looks for 1440p and 1080p gaming performance.

Starting at 1080p you can see that despite using the Ryzen 9 5950X with low latency memory we're still largely CPU bound at this lower resolution with average frame rates in excess of 200 fps. There's probably not much point comparing the 3090 and 3090 Ti here.

For those of you targeting 1440p with ultra-like quality settings the 3090 Ti appears to be on average 4% faster than equivalent 3090 models seen when comparing the MSI Suprim X cards.

Then at 4K we're looking at a 7% performance improvement when comparing the MSI Suprim X models which is rather underwhelming.

The 3090 Ti was 20% faster than the 6900 XT but we are talking about a stock 6900 XT. You could probably halve that margin with a good overclocker. In summary the 3090 Ti wasn't even 10% faster than the original 3090 but the MSRP has been jacked up by 33%.

Power Usage

The graphics board power rating was increased by almost 30% to 450 watts and that saw total system usage rise by an insane 18% to 702 watts with the Suprim X up from just shy of 600 watts with the original 3090.

That's a horrible increase for just 7% more performance on average.

What We Learned

We can already sense Nvidia fans asking ""what about ray tracing & DLSS? why haven't you talked about those?"" The reason is that the 3090 Ti will be no different than the 3090. Tack on a few percentage points and you have the 3090 Ti there's nothing truly new here.

And that's the problem with the RTX 3090 Ti in a nutshell. It's pretty much the same GPU that was launched 18 months ago but arriving way later to the party. Despite that it costs 33% more for ~10% more performance on the best of scenarios while sucking down ~30% more power. In my opinion the 3090 Ti defines modern overclocking for gamers: hot loud expensive and ultimately pointless.

The original RTX 3090 makes far more sense and it's quite something when a new Ti model makes the original dumb offering look all smart and sensible. But that's exactly what the 3090 Ti has done. It's made me look back at the 3090 and say well you weren't that bad after all. But then I remember it's just 14% faster than the RTX 3080 with a 114% increase in MSRP so I just get confused with all the silliness.

Speaking of silly... the Nvidia review guide for the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is truly something. Nvidia claims that the point of comparison for the 3090 Ti is the Titan RTX. You know that $2500 Turing GPU released in late 2018 almost 4 years ago now. Perhaps if the RTX 3090 with 24GB of VRAM didn't exist you could make that argument but it's been around for well over a year now.

Nvidia has also doubled down on pushing the 8K gaming angle. But why? No one bought it the first time (besides a few paid reviews). 8K gaming is not a thing for a few reasons... starting with where are the 8K gaming monitors they are promoting this for?

And I quote... ""The RTX 3090 Ti lets you play capture and watch your games in brilliant 8K HDR with DLSS Ultra Performance mode for 8K gaming."" But of course DLSS Ultra Performance mode isn't 8K gaming. 8K gaming would be 8K gaming not a scaled up version using DLSS.

Putting that aside for a second the fact remains that when using dialed down quality settings in Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing disabled the 3090 Ti couldn't achieve 60 fps at 4K so we don't think it's 8K ready with any level of DLSS support.

I will now quote myself ""if you're a PC gamer the RTX 3090 (Ti) doesn't really make much sense."" Had the new RTX 3090 Ti slotted into the original 3090's price point perhaps it'd have made for an okay release not amazing 18 months down the track but not horrible either.

In all honesty this was in dire need of updates in order to regain its competitiveness in the mid-range segment of performance/gaming notebooks which it topped at some point in the past.

They’ve brought changes to the design and overall ergonomics of this series updated the inputs and the screen choices and revamped the internals allowing for modern specs running at higher power a more complex cooling module and a larger battery. There’s also a MUX now on this series with Advanced Optimus support on some configurations but I would have hoped Acer would improve the audio quality at least to some extent as that’s been a known culprit of the past Helios and Nitro products – they did not.

In the detailed review down below we’ll discuss these and all the other important aspects that you should know about the 2022 Predator Helios 300 series before jumping on it.

Update: I’ve edited an error in the initial article claiming there is no MUX on this design (thanks for pointing it out to me in the comments section). There is actually a MUX that can be enabled in the BIOS but it doesn’t work properly with the current early-software that I have on this unit. This is affecting the gaming benchmarks – looking for a BIOS update from Acer and will retest and update the Gaming section.

Acer offers the 2022 Predator Helios 300 series in a multitude of configurations and in either 15 to 17-inch screen sizes. For this generation the lineup is Intel exclusive with DDR5 memory and GPU options between an RTX 3060 140W and an RTX 3080 150W. There’s no Intel Core i9 option though only Core i7 processors.

We’ll cover the other variation in future reviews but the majority of our thoughts in this article apply to the entire series regardless of the exact variant.

Update: Here are our thoughts on the updated 2023 Acer Predator Helios 16 and Helios 18 lineups.

Design and exterior

This 2022 Helios 300 design improves on the aesthetics and ergonomics of the previous chassis in a few notable ways.

The design is cleaner with few and muted branding elements and almost none of those gaming accents present before. There’s still a Predator logo in the middle of the lid though and it’s panel lit which means it can’t be switched off. This could be a deal-breaker in very strict school/business environments and I wish Acer got rid of it.

There’s also a light bar on the front edge but that’s actually rather cool looking and subtle plus can be controlled from the settings and switched off if required.

Other than these the 2022 Helios 300 looks and feels nice with a mostly dark-blue theme and only some gray elements on the back hump behind the screen around the exhaust and the IO.

I will also mention that Acer moved towards a more minimalistic rectangular chassis design with this update and got rid of the angular cuts around the front of the laptop. They also made an effort to dull off the front lip and the corners but they could have done a little better as this front lip still feels somewhat uncomfortable on the wrists especially as a result of the fact that this is a full-size laptop with a tall front profile.

In fact this Predator Helios 300 series is heavier and larger than the previous generation and some of its direct competitors weighing almost 7 lbs in this tested configuration with 2x SSDs and memory sticks. In comparison the ROG Scar 17 only weighs about 6.1 lbs while the MSI GP76 Vector weighs 7.5+ lbs.

Part of this weight increase is a result of the updated thermal module required to cope with the higher-power implemented hardware. Nonetheless this does offer the same 150W GPU implementations that are also available in the Scar 17 and Vector GP77 and not the higher power variants available in the MSI Raiders. Paired with the chunky and heavy 330W charger this 17-inch Helios 300 is primarily a desk computer and not ideal for commuting.

On the other hand this does feel well made with a strong screen ensemble and little flex in the keyboard deck. Metal pieces are used for the lid interior and sides with plastic only found on the underside. The dark-blue metal does smudge easily so you’ll have to clean it often.

As far as the other practical aspects go I appreciate that Acer have finally moved the status LEDs from underneath the screen and sent them to the sides so there’s nothing impeding your experience with night-time use. I also appreciate the good grip offered by the rubber feet and the strong feel of the hinges. The screen only goes back to about 160 degrees on the back which is not ideal but alright for a full-size 17-inch laptop that will spend most of its life on a desk.

One final aspect I’ll mention here is the IO which has been mostly rearranged with the PSU and most of the big connectors moved to the back edge out of the way. You’ll find a Thunderbolt 4 port there with support for video (through the iGPU) data and charging (up to 100W) a novelty for the Helios lineup. There are also a miniDP and an HDMI 2.1 port on the back both hooked into the Nvidia dGPU.

The USB-A ports are still on the sides conveniently spread on the left and right and the 3.5 mm audio jack is on the left edge as well. The LAN is still on the left and hasn’t been squeezed on the back next to the others which is my only nit with this design. Oh and there are still no card reader and no biometrics.

Keyboard and trackpad

Acer have updated the inputs on this 2022 Predator Helios 300 lineup.

The major change is in the keyboard. The layout is not a lot different than what they used before with a set of full-size main keys and a narrower set for the NumPad section at the right plus full-sized arrows but squeezed among the other keys in a way that makes them difficult to find without looking.

What’s changed is the design and profile of the keycaps which are now solid black without wide sides and shorter overall. That’s why the overall feedback of this implementation is closer to an ultraportable design than to a full-size gaming laptop which means this is a quick and quiet typer but that it might also seem a little shallow on a first contact.

I got used to it quickly though and I found the keys’ resistance and overall feedback one of the better balanced in this class.

Acer updated the backlighting system as well opting for a miniLED implementation with per-key RGB control. Various effects are selectable from the Armour Crate app where you also get the key the manually customize each key if you want to.

I find this illumination system a noticeable update with punchy LEDs and excellent uniformity as well as little light bleeding from underneath the keycaps despite their low profile design.

What I don’t like is that you still need to press a key in order to reactive the backlighting once it times out you can’t do it by swiping your fingers over the clickpad as on other modern designs. You can disable the time-off in the settings and at least there’s a physical Caps Lock indicator which was also missing from the past Acer keyboard layouts.

The clickpad seems to be a little wider than on the previous Helios 300 models but the functionality and overall feel haven’t changed. This is still a plastic surface but smooth and accurate to the touch so a fair performer with daily use. It does rattle with firmer taps though but the physical clicks are quiet and smooth.

Finally I’ll add that there are no biometrics in this series.

Screen

Acer offer a couple of screen options for the 2022 Predator Helios 300 17-inch series either FHD 165Hz with 100% sRGB or QHD 165Hz with 100% DCI-P3 both with fast 3ms response times. What we have here on this sample is the 165Hz FHD panel made by AU Optronics. This is well suited for everyday use and gaming with fast response times and the 165Hz refresh and it’s better than the average entry-level panel offered by Acer in the past for the Helios lineup with still ~85% DCI-P3 color coverage 350-nits of brightness and a measured contrast of around 1350:1.

Here’s what we got in our tests with an X-Rite i1 Display Pro sensor:

Panel HardwareID: AU Optronics AUO9AA0 (B173HAN05.5);

Type: 8bit SDR;

Coverage: 99.1% sRGB 79.6% AdobeRGB 84.2% DCI-P3;

Measured gamma: 2.19;

Max brightness in the middle of the screen: 364.12 cd/m2 on power;

Min brightness in the middle of the screen: 19.58 cd/m2 on power;

Contrast at max brightness: 1367:1;

White point: 6300 K;

Black on max brightness: 0.26 cd/m2;

PWM: No.

The panel came well-calibrated out-of-the-box with only a mild skewness in the White Point. Once further calibrated it proved uniform in luminosity and color and we only noticed limited light-bleeding around the edges on a completely black background at maximum brightness.

As far as the QHD 165Hz panel option available for this series that’s most likely similar to the one we’ve tested in the Nitro 5. It offers similar specs to the FHD variant on our sample but with the increased sharpness associated with the higher resolution and the richer colors at 100% DCI-P3 coverage. If given the choice I’d pay extra for this panel especially on the RTX 3070 and higher configurations.

One final aspect to be mentioned here is that neither of these panel options is very bright or offers higher than 165 Hz refresh rates and that might cause some potential buyers to look elsewhere. For the majority of users though these options will do fine.

Hardware and performance

Our test model is a higher-specced configuration of the 2022 Acer Predator Helios 300 17-inch code name PH317-56 built on an Intel Core i7-12700H processor 32 GB of DDR5-4800 memory in dual channel 2 TB of fast SSD storage and dual graphics: the Nvidia RTX 3070Ti dGPU with 8 GB of vRAM and the Iris Xe iGPU integrated within the Intel processor.

Disclaimer: Before we proceed keep in mind that our review unit was sent over by Acer and it runs on the early software available as of mid-March 2022 (BIOS v0.18A1 Predator Sense 3.00.3184 GeForce Game Ready 512.15 drivers). Some aspects can change with later software.

Spec-wise the 2022 Acer Predator Helios 300 is built on the latest Intel and Nvidia hardware available to date. The Core i7-12700H is a mainstream Intel Alder Lake 12th-gen processor with 14 Cores and 20 Threads. It is a hybrid CPU with 6 High-Performance HyperThreaded Cores and 8 extra Efficiency cores working together or separate based on demand. The design of this Helios 300 allows the processor to run at up to 110W of sustained power in demanding CPU loads on the Exterme profile.

For the GPU the 2022 Helios 3000 series is available with RTX 3000 and RTX 3000 Ti graphics chips. What we have on this sample is an RTX 3070Ti running at up to 150W with Dynamic Boost in supported games and applications.

For the RAM and storage options the laptop offers two accessible memory DIMMs and two M.2 SSD slots. Our unit shipped with 32 GB of DDR5-4800 RAM in dual-channel and two fast PCIe gen4 Samsung SSDs in Raid0.

Accessing the components requires taking out the back panel which is held in place by a couple of Philips screws. Inside you’ll find the RAM and storage slots the wifi chip the thermal module the 90 Wh battery and the speakers. There’s also a fair bit of unused space inside as this 17-inch Helios 300 shares a common internal design with the more compact 15-inch variant.

Specs aside the Predator Helios 300 is controllable through the included Predator Sense application which allows access to power profiles battery keyboard and audio settings. There’s also an Acer Care app that handles updates as well as a handful of other software – bloatware that comes preinstalled.

The power profiles are Quiet Default Extreme and Turbo and they impact the fans’ behavior and the CPU/GPU power limits as well as add a GPU overclock on Extreme/Turbo.

For daily use I’d keep the laptop on Quiet which still provides a snappy experience and keeps the fans idle most of the time. Here’s what to expect in terms of performance and temperatures with everyday multitasking browsing and video.

Performance and benchmarks

On to more demanding loads we start by testing the CPU’s performance by running the Cinebench R15 test for 15+ times in a loop with a 1-2 seconds delay between each run.

On the Extreme setting the Core i7-12700H processor runs close to its PL2 limit design of 109W for a few loops but eventually ends up oscillating in between 70 to 110W due to a slightly thermal throttling with the current BIOS and settings. That’s less noticeable in this loop test and more easily observable in the more challenging Cineebcnh R23 and Blender loop tests illustrated further down in the article.

The fans run at around 48 dB on this Extreme mode and about 80% of their rpm capacity. They can be pushed up to 100% on the Turbo mode which translates in a 58 dB noise level. In this case the CPU runs constantly at 109W the PL2 design power with CPU temperatures in the high-80s.

There’s no undervolting option in the BIOS and voltage control is locked with both XTU and Throttlestop so there’s no way to tweak the CPU at this point.

Switching over to the Default profile causes the CPU to run at 85W in this test. However we noticed that the CPU actually runs at 85W for a few minutes in the more challenging loads and then powers down to 45W for a few loops in order to cool down. This is more easily observable in R23 and Blender. The fan noise drops to 45 dB not a lot different than on Extreme.

There’s also a Quiet profile that keeps the fans under 40 dB. In this case the CPU fluctuates between 85 and 35W periods more often with the power limit being enforced when the die hits temperatures of 95 degrees. This is noticeable in R15 as well but once more especially in R23 and Blender.

Finally the CPU runs at ~40 W on battery on the Default profile with still respectable scores and temperatures and quiet fans at sub-40 dB. Details below.

To put these in perspective here’s how this Core i7-12700H implementation fares against other full-size implementations in this test both Intel and AMD.

It ends up ~10% slower than the Core i9-12900H and ~10% faster than the Ryzen 9 6900HX both in similar power/cooled designs and significantly faster than any of the 2021 platforms.

We then went ahead and further verified our findings with the more taxing Cinebench R23 loop test and Blender – Classroom which resulted in similar findings to what we explained above.

We also ran the 3DMark CPU test on the Extreme profile.

Finally we ran our combined CPU+GPU stress tests on this notebook. 3DMark stress runs the same test for 20 times in a loop and looks for performance variation and degradation over time and this unit passed it just fine which means there’s no performance throttling with longer-duration sustained combined loads.

Next we ran the entire suite of tests and benchmarks on the stock Extreme profile in Predator Sense with the dGPU set on Hybrid/Optimus mode in the BIOS (the default setting) and on FHD display resolution for consistency with our other tests. Keep in mind that this system allows for up to 190W of combined CPU+GPU power on this Extreme mode as well as applies a +100 MHz Clock/+200MHz Memory overclock to the GPU.

Here’s what we got.

3DMark 13 – Fire Strike: 26515 (Graphics – 30590 Physics – 30105 Combined – 12176);

These are solid results and what you should expect from this sort of full-power Core i7-12700H implementation.

Compared to the similarly powered i9+RTX 3070Ti 150W configuration tested in the ROG Scar 17 this Helios 300 ends up scoring within 5% in the CPU tests and up to 5% better in the GPU tests. That’s due to the earlier drivers on the Scar as well as the more aggressive Overlock applied by the Extreme profile on this Helios 300 as the two designs are otherwise the same RTX 3070Ti 150W chip. The Helios does allow for up to 190W of combined CPU+GPU power though while the Scar design only allows for 180W and that could also translate in a small advantage for the Predator.

Against the i7 + RTX 3070Ti 150W version of the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro we’re looking at very close performance between the two as expected given the similar power settings between them.

Compared to the slightly lowered power 2022 Acer Nitro 5 configuration with the Core i7 + RTX 3070Ti 140W the Helios ends up 5-20% faster in these tests.

At the same time compared to the 2021 Predator Helios 300 in an Intel Core i7-11800H + RTX 3070 100W configuration this updated 2022 variant ends up 30-40% faster in the CPU tests and 15-25% faster in the GPU loads.

And here are some workstation benchmarks on the same Extreme profile:

Once more this i7+3070Ti 2022 configuration is a close contender to the Scar 17 which still ends up winning most tests though thanks to the slightly higher frequencies of the Core i9 processor. We’ll further dig into this in the gaming section.

Now all these are excellent results but the laptop does run at 48-53 dB on this Extreme profile so there might be situations when you’d prefer sacrificing the performance for quieter fan noise. Here’s how this Predator Helios 300 performs on the Default profile which limits the fans to around 45-48 dB at head level.

3DMark 13 – Fire Strike: 23651 (Graphics – 28747 Physics – 22967 Combined – 10353);

23651 (Graphics – 28747 Physics – 22967 Combined – 10353); 3DMark 13 – Time Spy: 10721 (Graphics – 10795 CPU – 10322);

CPU 6693 cb CPU Single Core 692 CB; x265 HD Benchmark 64-bit: 27.82 s.

The CPU scores take a 10-30% hit compared to the Extreme profile while the GPU scores only drop by about 10%. The components are going to run warmer though and the CPU will thermally throttle in sustained loads as explained before.

Even more aggressive CPU limiting happens on the Quiet mode which keeps the fans at sub 38dB.

Here are a few results in this case:

3DMark 13 – Fire Strike: 1540-7 (Graphics – 17203 Physics – 18916 Combined – 7475);

1540-7 (Graphics – 17203 Physics – 18916 Combined – 7475); 3DMark 13 – Time Spy: 9097 (Graphics – 9289 CPU – 8145);

CPU 6356 cb CPU Single Core 683 CB; x265 HD Benchmark 64-bit: 29.14 s.

We’re looking at about 60-75% of the CPU and GPU performance compared to the Extreme profile as this mode automatically applies Nvidia’s Whisper Mode to the GPU with an impact over some tests. Those are significant differences but the fans are also running much quieter in this case at sub 38 dB levels.

Gaming performance

Historically the Predator Helios 300s have been primarily gaming computers so let’s see how this 2022 generation handles modern titles.

We tested several games at the screen’s FHD resolution on Ultra settings on the stock Extreme Default and Quiet profiles.

However takes these with a lump of salt and here’s why. At this point the MUX doesn’t properly work with the BIOS version that we have on this laptop. There is the option to select the dGPU Graphics mode in the BIOS (hit Ctrl+S in the Advanced Section) but it doesn’t display anything on the main screen when I do it so I couldn’t properly test it. As a result the gaming results down below are on the Hybrid/Optimus mode with the signal routed through the iGPU which takes a small toll on the performance.

I’m waiting for a BIOS update and will retest and update if possible.

Still I did test the Extreme profile connected to an external display through the HDMI 2.1 port (with a direct connection to the Nvidia dGPU) which showcases what you should expect from this laptop with a properly working MUX setup.

Here’s what we got.

Once more we’re comparing these with our findings on the i9 + RTX 3070Ti configuration tested on the Scar 17 and Scar 15.

The FHD results are close between the three with only a minor advantage for the Scar designs. This is not an apples-to-apples comparison though due to the differences in software between the two designs the fact that the RTX 3070Ti gets a +100 MHz OC on the Helios and only a +50MHz OC on the Scars and especially due to the fact that there’s a working MUX on the Scars while the MUX doesn’t work on this Helios 300 tested version with the current BIOS. With a more mature BIOS I expect the Predator Helios 300 to have a slight edge on the Scar due to the higher OC and higher CPU+GPU power settings (up to 190W on the Helios up to 180W on the Scars).

What this Helios 300 would deliver with a properly working MUX is showcased by the external-display scenarios and with the exception of Doom: Eternal the differences in framerates are within less than 10% at FHD resolution and Ultra settings. These differences are going to be even lower at QHD resolution in case you’re opting for a QHD display variant of this Helios 300.

As for the generational improvements over the 2021 Predator Helios 300 the 2022 model ends up about 30% faster in games in our tests. This is huge!

With these out of the way let’s go over some performance and temperatures logs.

The Extreme mode pushes the fans to about 80% of their rpms which translates into fan noise of around 52-53 dB with games.

The components run at temperatures in the 80-85 degrees in most titles that scale well with Dynamic Boost. This design offers a generous 190W combined CPU+GPU power allowance with up to 150W on the GPU. However in those titles that don’t scale well with Dynamic Boost such as Far Cry 5 more power is allocated to the CPU and that causes it to run hot at 90-95 degrees C.

The thermal design is fairly good here but the majority of the fresh air comes in from the underside of the laptop where the slim-profile feet will choke the intakes to some extent as long as you’re keeping the laptop on the desk. As a result bumping up the back of this laptop from the desk is going to help lower the internal temperatures by 3-7 degrees on both the CPU and the GPU.

Activating the Turbo mode does that as well as it ramps the fans to 100% of their rpms. That translates into noise levels of 58+ dB at head level so I’d refrain from using this profile as much as possible.

The Default limits the combined power allowance to 160W with up to 135 W on the GPU. It also lowers the fan’s speeds to some amount the noise levels ending up around 44-45 dB.

With titles that scale well with Dynamic Boost the CPU ends up at around 80 degrees Celsius in this mode but the GPU heats up close to the throttling limit of 87 C. Not ideal.

Once more bumping up the back of the laptop from the desk helps lower the internal temperatures by a few degrees making this Default profile safer for longer gaming sessions.

I’d also consider running games on the Quiet mode especially when looking for low fan noise.

In this case the fans don’t go over 37-38 dB and the performance is still alright with most titles. The system limits the power to 105W combined and 80W on the GPU so you’ll end up with about 60-70% of the framerates possible on Turbo but that’s still within the playable range with most titles at FHD resolution and max graphics settings.

Finally you can also game on the Default mode unplugged from the wall. Framerates are capped to 60 fps by default in this case in titles such as Witcher 3 or less with more recent AAA games. Don’t expect more than one to one a half hours of gaming time.

Overall this Predator Helios 300 is a powerful full-size notebook on this 2022-generation variant even in this early sample with an immature BIOS version. It performs very well in most of our tests and it doesn’t overheat in most games. However the fan profiles are set up aggressively in order to achieve these results so you’ll either have to go with good headphones to cover up those fans or opt for the limited Quiet mode. Nice to have the option though.

Noise Heat Connectivity speakers and others

Acer have updated the thermal design for the 2022 Predator Helios 300 generation adding extra heatpipes on both components slightly higher capacity fans and liquid metal thermal compound (on the CPU). There’s also a thermal shield over the RAM.

Paired with the aggressive fan settings this is a solid cooling design capable of taming the higher-power components in this chassis.

The main fresh-air intakes are somewhat choked though but the slim-profile rubber feet implement here so bumping the laptop or using a cooling pad is going to help lower the internal temperatures by a fair amount.

No complaints about the external temperatures with games and demand loads.

*Gaming – Default – playing Witcher 3 for 30 minutes fans at ~45 dB

*Gaming – Extreme – playing Witcher 3 for 30 minutes fans at ~52 dB



The laptop also keeps quiet during daily use with the fans remaining idle most of the time on the Quiet mode.

*Daily Use – streaming Netflix in EDGE for 30 minutes Silent profile fans at 0 dB

For connectivity there’s Wireless 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 on this unit through a Killer Intel-based chip. This is faster than what I’ve seen on most other 2022 laptops and I hope Acer will offer the same chip in the retail models as well – there’s no guarantee with the current chip shortage though.

The audio quality is one of the important aspects that Acer haven’t updated for the 2022 Predator Helios 300.

They still put some minuscule speakers inside this laptop and as a result the audio lacks in both volumes and quality. Don’t expect more than 75 dB levels and max and limited audio quality especially in the lows. Even the Enhanced Audio setting in Windows 11 can’t do much here so plan for some good headphones alongside this laptop if you care about sound. These will also help cover that high fan noise with demanding loads.

Finally there’s the camera which hasn’t been updated from the previous Helios versions either. However this is actually alright quality for a mid-range laptop these days and is placed where it should be at the top of the screen flanked by microphones.

Battery life

There’s a 90Wh battery inside the 17-inch 2022 Predator Helios 300 a step-up from the 58 Wh battery in the previous generations.

Here’s what we got on our review unit in terms of battery life with the screen’s brightness set at around 120 nits (~60 brightness):

18 W (~5-6 h of use) – text editing in Google Drive Silent Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– text editing in Google Drive Silent Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 16 W (~5-6 h of use) – 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in Edge Silent Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in Edge Silent Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 14.5 W (~5-6 h of use) – Netflix fullscreen in Edge Silent Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– Netflix fullscreen in Edge Silent Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 25 W (~4 h of use) – browsing in Edge Balanced Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON.

The system doesn’t automatically switch the screen’s refresh to 60 Hz when using the laptop on battery so we ran our tests on the default 165Hz refresh. Manually opting for 60Hz would have a slightly positive impact on the runtimes corroborated with more mature software that should be available in the future. I’d especially expect an impact on video streaming and light use.

One other aspect to mention here is that our unit shipped with Acer’s massive 330W charger which weighs a whopping 3 lbs / 1.35 kilos. That’s probably what you’ll get with the retail models as well given the power settings on this lineup.

For what it’s worth though this series supports USB-C charging as well up to 100W just in case you don’t want to carry the chunky main charger with you. Of course you’re not getting full performance on USB-C power.

Price and availability- 2022 Acer Predator Helios 300

The 2022 Predator Helios 300 series is expected in stores around April of this year with prices starting at around 1700 USD/ 2000 EUR for the base configurations.

As of early-April 2022 the Core i7-12700H + RTX 3060 + 32 GB RAM + 1TB SSD + FHD 165Hz configuration is listed at 1999 EUR in Germany and other EU countries. The RTX 3070Ti configuration reviewed here goes for 2499 EUR and the RTX 3080 for 2699 EUR.

Those are hefty price tags. I’ve yet to find these listed in North America or the UK but hopefully Acer will offer more competitive pricing in those regions.

We’ll update you when we know more. In the meantime follow this link for updated configurations and prices in your region at the time you’re reading this article.

Final thoughts- Acer Predator Helios 300 review

The 2022 generation of the Predator Helios 300 is once more a competitive performance/gaming notebook in the mid-tier segment significantly improving the performance of the previous variants.

For this update Acer significantly bumped the power settings and upgraded the thermal module to cope with them. The laptop is no longer running as cooly as it used to but with up to 50% faster abilities in CPU loads and 30% on the GPU side I can live with the components running at higher temperatures and the fans running louder. Furthermore the alternative Quiet profile addresses both these aspects while diminishing the capabilities to the levels of the past models.

Specs aside the 2022 Helios 300 also gets updated screen options one of the better keyboards in the segments and a good set of ports. Add in the 90 Wh battery added inside and the slight refinements in design and ergonomics and this should be on your shortlist in the coming months.

At the same time Acer haven’t done anything about the audio quality of this series so you’ll want to use headphones. They’ll help cover the fan noise as well btw.

In the end pricing is going to play a decisive role in the popularity of this series moving forward. In the past the Helios 300 was one of the better-value mid-tier gaming laptops but from what I can tell right now I don’t think that’s the case anymore. This aspect corroborated with the fact that the series remains an Intel exclusive and is not available in AMD variants might steer some potential buyers away.

This pretty much wraps up our review of the 2022 AcerPredator Helios 300 series. I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback down below and don’t hesitate to get in touch with any questions.

On March 29 the House of Representatives voted 414-5 in favor of the Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2022. If passed by the Senate and then signed into law by President Joe Biden the act could represent a massive economic policy shift regarding retirement savings and investment.

See: 2022 Changes to 401(k) Limits and Backdoor Roth IRAs

The retirement savings legislation also known as SECURE Act 2.0 expands on the original SECURE Act and includes provisions to boost the required minimum distribution (RMD) age from 72 to 75 over time broaden automatic enrollment in retirement plans and enhance 403(b) plans.

The original Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act was passed into law by former President Donald Trump in December 2019. This legislation altered the existing retirement savings plan system in terms of RMD contributions to traditional IRAs 529 plan uses for student loans and making annuities easier for 401(k) plan administrators to offer.

The SECURE Act 2.0 expands on all of these provisions including increasing the RMD age further to 73 in 2022 to 74 in 2029 and to 75 in 2032.

It also requires 401(k) and 403(b) plans to automatically enroll participants when they become eligible though employees may opt out of this coverage. The automatic enrollment amount starts at a minimum 3% of salary — but no more than 10% — followed by a 1% increase each year until it reaches said 10%. There is an exception to this requirement pertaining to small businesses with 10 or fewer employees new businesses (those less than three years old) church plans and governmental plans.

The SECURE Act 2.0 also changes policies on catch-up limits concerning retirement plans (and indexes IRA catch-up limits to inflation beginning in 2023) student loan repayments and employer matching of such as retirement contributions small employer pension plan start-up credits and collective investment trusts (CITs) in 403(b) plans. Further the legislation opens up opportunities for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in variable annuities.

Talking about the bill in his “Update on the March-April Work Period” letter on March 25 House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer proclaimed: “By expanding automatic enrollment in employer provided retirement plans simplifying rules for small businesses and helping those near retirement save more for longer this legislation will help increase Americans’ access to retirement funds and help families save for the future.”

Thanks to this trust the company’s stock has soared from a low of around ₹300 in April-May 2020 to nearly three times currently. And despite the run-up the stock is still a buy for investors with a long-term view.

Strong performance

The stock price increase was thanks to Oberoi’s good operating results in the three quarters of FY22 as many projects got completed and sales gained momentum. The company sold around 0.92 million sq ft (msf) in Q3 which was 70 per cent of the total bookings in the nine months of FY22. Per-sq-ft prices were stable or increased in the recent quarter.

Consolidated revenue for the nine months of FY22 was ₹1870 crore up 48 per cent yoy . Residential sales which account for over 80 per cent share of revenue were at ₹1591 crore up 63 per cent. Hospitality revenue (from Westin Mumbai) increased 148 per cent yoy with average occupancy increasing to 65 per cent from 28 per cent a year ago. Average room rates grew from ₹5669 in Q3 of FY21 to ₹6918 in Q3 FY22.

Operating margins in the residential segment were stable – at about 40 per cent – in the nine months of FY22. In Q3 FY22 it moderated due to higher contribution from lower margin projects/units. The management expects that it will be able to bump up sale price to maintain margin as projects move towards completion  to absorb any rise in raw material costs. For example price per sq ft increased from an average of ₹16754 in FY21 to ₹18147 in FY22 in the Sky City project (high-end apartments in Borivilli).

However rental income from malls fell – to ₹316 crore in the nine months of FY22 versus ₹864 crore in the same period in FY21 – due to a Covid-induced dip in Q2 FY22 with uncollected rents. Area leased and revenue picked up in Q3 FY22 to nearly half the levels in the same period last year and this would continue as post-pandemic normalcy returns. Commercial property rents were stable with good occupancy albeit at slightly lower rates per sq ft. With the proximity to the under-construction metro stations occupancy and rental rates are likely to inch up going forward.

Operating cash flow was healthy at ₹7615 crore in the nine months of FY22 compared to ₹2975 crore in the same period in FY21.

Good pipeline

Oberoi’s geography is Mumbai and its current residential projects are in the Western suburb. The housing market in Mumbai Metro Region (MMR) has been upbeat – data from research firm Knight Frank showed that the number of residential units registered in 2021 was higher than the previous record of 80746 units in 2018 by 38 per cent (70 per cent higher yoy). And the Western suburb has been accounting for over half of the sales. The robust infrastructure development of metros and roads will be positive for the city’s property sales and price growth over the next few years.

The company has lined up a strong launch pipeline providing cash flow visibility. Oberoi will also be foraying into mid-income housing segment with a project in Thane expected to be launched in the next quarter. The project is likely to contribute significantly to sales in the next two years. Good performance in this project will help open a sizeable market beyond the high-end segment.

Also subsequent phases of projects in Borivali and Goregaon are likely to start in FY23. The premium joint venture project – Three Sixty West in Worli – is complete and the management expects to get occupancy certificate in Q4 FY22. This can help drive sales which have been gruellingly slow as there is a customer preference for completed homes in this price point.

Oberoi is actively looking at land buying opportunities in MMR as well as expansion beyond the region. In Q3 FY22 a 4.3-acre land was purchased in Bhandup for about ₹115 crore.

Reasonable valuation

At the current price of ₹987.55 the stock trades at 32.5 times the annualised nine-months earnings and 3.5 times its book value (of ₹280 as on December 31 2021). This is not cheap but the premium is reasonable as the property sector is cyclical and the outlook is positive after a prolonged period of lull in the market. Also not just revenue and margins will grow at a good pace it is also possible that given the paucity of quality players the stock may also benefit from an uptick in its multiple.

Why Strong operations Good outlook Prudent leverage

The management continues to be prudent in managing its finances. It took on debt at favourable rates through Non-Convertible Debentures (tenures of two-four years) to fund expansion. With a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.28 the company is in a comfortable position with ample room for growth.

The key risk to consider is the slow off-take of its Worli project where Oberoi has a 32 per cent revenue share. Lack of momentum could dampen the price growth outlook.

Promoters hold 67.7 per cent stake as of December 31 2021 (unchanged from a year ago); FIIs’ share dropped to 20.49 per cent (from 25.62 per cent) and DIIs’ holding increased to 8.71 per cent (from 4.43 per cent).

The singer who was nominated for six Grammys at last year’s ceremony for her album “Future Nostalgia” has been tapped to be one of the many artists presenting at the show. She ended up taking home the award for Best Pop Vocal Album.

In the last year Lipa and Versace the label’s artistic director have worked closely together. During the 2021 Grammy Awards the singer wore three different custom outfits by Atelier Versace.

During Milan Fashion Week in September the singer made her runway debut walking for the label’s spring 2022 collection wearing two outfits. The first was a black blazer dress with a cutout design featuring safety pins in different colors along the right side of the skirt. The second was a hot pink glittering two-piece set with a cropped tank top and midi skirt with a high thigh slit.

At the end of the show Lipa walked out to join Versace for her final bow at the end cementing herself as one the brand’s muses.

WASHINGTON DC—Adding the PCSK9 inhibitor alirocumab (Praluent; Sanofi/Regeneron) to high-intensity statin therapy enhances coronary plaque regression and stabilization when started early after an acute MI the PACMAN-AMI shows.

Lorenz Räber (Source ACC)

Serial intracoronary imaging showed that the combination provided greater reductions in percent atheroma volume and lipid burden as well as a greater increase in minimal fibrous cap thickness through a year of treatment compared with statin therapy alone Lorenz Räber MD PhD (Bern University Hospital Switzerland) reported here at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 2022 Scientific Session.

The findings published simultaneously online in JAMA “provide the mechanistic rationale in favor of an early initiation of very intensive LDL-lowering in acute MI patients” he concluded.

Commenting after Räber’s presentation Michael Blaha MD (Johns Hopkins University Medical Center Baltimore MD) said the PACMAN-AMI results are relevant for a couple of reasons even though alirocumab has already been shown to have a clinical benefit in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES which demonstrated a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with the PCSK9 inhibitor in stabilized patients with ACS.

First “it’s extremely important to understand the mechanism of what we’re doing and how that’s influencing outcomes” Blaha said adding that the information will prove useful when speaking with patients about plaque modulation. “I also think it’s important to understand the biology of lipid-lowering therapy.”

And second Blaha said the trial is important because of the targeted population with lipid-lowering therapy being initiated earlier shortly after an acute MI building on several prior studies supporting the safety of treatment in this setting.

“Those things I think make this study extremely relevant in 2022” he said.

In PACMAN-AMI there were no differences between trial arms in all-cause mortality and MI but there was a significant reduction in ischemia-driven coronary revascularization of non-infarct-related arteries with alirocumab treatment (8.2% vs 18.5%).

Asked whether a more-definite study of clinical outcomes would be needed before moving PCSK9 inhibition earlier after acute MI Blaha noted that a single-center study of another agent in this class—evolocumab (Repatha; Amgen)—showed that in-hospital administration during large MIs appeared safe and effective. That’s bolstered he said by the results of HUYGENS with evolocumab and now PACMAN-AMI with alirocumab.

There are “a lot of data now coming out that shows that this is a viable strategy that appears safe” Blaha told TCTMD. “I think selectively we can start doing this even now. I think it’s safe to do it. I think there’s mechanistic reasons to think we should do it.”

Still a more-definitive trial would be helpful he said pointing out that a trial of evolocumab in acute MI was recently announced. “I think selectively we can start it now but probably for wide guideline endorsement we need the trial.”

PACMAN-AMI

Coronary plaques that are likely to rupture and cause an acute MI often have a large plaque burden high lipid content and thin fibrous caps Räber noted. Statins slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis but the impact of PCSK9 inhibitors on plaque characteristics especially when given early after ACS is not well known.

PACMAN-AMI conducted at nine study sites in Switzerland Denmark the Netherlands and Austria was designed to study that question. Investigators enrolled 300 patients (mean age 58.5 years; 18.7% women) with acute STEMI (53%) or NSTEMI (47%) who underwent successful PCI of the infarct vessel and had angiographic evidence of nonobstructive atherosclerosis (20% to 50% diameter stenosis) in two non-infarct-related arteries. LDL-cholesterol level had to be above 125 mg/dL (3.2 mmol/L) in statin-naive patients and above 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) in statin-treated patients. Only about 12% of patients were on statins when entering the study.

At baseline patients had coronary plaque characteristics in the non-infarct-related arteries assessed using IVUS near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The imaging was repeated at 1 year.

After baseline imaging patients were randomized to alirocumab 150 mg delivered subcutaneously every 2 weeks plus rosuvastatin 20 mg or placebo plus rosuvastatin. Treatment was started within 24 hours of successful PCI.

Through 1 year LDL cholesterol dropped by an average of 50.7% in the placebo group and 84.8% in the alirocumab group.

That translated into a significantly greater reduction in IVUS-derived percent atheroma volume—the primary endpoint—in the alirocumab arm (2.13% vs 0.92%; P < 0.001).

One has to be impressed that if you get more than a 50% reduction [in LDL] you get more plaque remodeling. Anthony DeMaria

Two powered secondary endpoints also favored the addition of PCSK9 inhibition with a greater reduction in the NIRS-measured maximum lipid-core burden index within 4 mm (79.42 vs 37.60; P = 0.006) and a larger increase in OCT-measured minimal fibrous cap thickness (62.67 vs 33.19 µm; P = 0.001).

Of note all of these changes were greatest in patients with lower on-treatment LDL-cholesterol levels particularly when they fell below 50 mg/dL. That Räber said during a press briefing suggests “that we should achieve very very low LDL levels in our patients at very high risk.”

Blaha called the observed plaque changes particularly those involving phenotype changes “very impressive” and “pretty substantial” pointing out that the findings are consistent with those of the HUYGENS trial with evolocumab. “It really shows a very consistent biology here which is that further LDL-lowering in this acute period markedly modulates plaque” he told TCTMD.

And it appears to be safe as rates of adverse events (71% with alirocumab and 73% with placebo) and serious adverse events (32% and 33%) were similar in the two trial arms. The only adverse event of special interest that was significantly higher in the alirocumab-treated patients was the occurrence of general allergic reactions (3.4% vs 0).

Talking to Patients

Räber and others indicated that the findings of PACMAN-AMI could be useful when counseling patients with atherosclerosis.

Anthony DeMaria MD (UC San Diego Health La Jolla CA) a past president of the ACC said his patients often ask him how they can make their plaques go away. This trial which DeMaria called the trial a “tour de force” during the press briefing provides evidence that plaques can be remodeled even if they might not get much smaller. “I think that will incentivize patients in large measure” he said.

The results also raise questions about whether there should be a goal below which LDL-cholesterol levels should be driven DeMaria said noting that there has been some debate about this in recent years. “Here one has to be impressed that if you get more than a 50% reduction . . . you get more plaque remodeling” he commented. “And if it can’t be done with statins alone then it should be done with statins plus whatever is necessary. So in my mind I want my own LDL to be as low as possible.”

We’re changing your plaque we’re stabilizing your plaque. We’re also regressing it a little bit but that might be a small part of what we’re doing. Michael Blaha

Räber agreed that these data could be used in discussions with patients saying that motivation is an important component when it comes to LDL-lowering therapy. Visualization of plaque changes is an additional piece of information that can keep patients on their medications something that has proven to be a challenge for some.

The message Blaha tells patients is: “We’re changing your plaque we’re stabilizing your plaque. We’re also regressing it a little bit but that might be a small part of what we’re doing.”

The findings of PACMAN-AMI and other studies increasingly support the idea of getting PCSK9 inhibitors on hospital formularies to allow for earlier access to the medications for patients Blaha added. That would ultimately improve access to the drugs which has been getting better in recent years as costs have come down by about 50%.

These data also suggest that clinicians should be looking to stabilize coronary plaques earlier in the disease course even before an MI has occurred. “It takes me to that future goal” Blaha said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9yb2NoZXN0ZXItaW52ZXN0bWVudC1mdW5kLWZvY3VzZXMtb24tbWVkdGVjaC1saWZlLXNjaWVuY2VzLXN0YXJ0dXBzLWluLXJlZ2lvbi82MDAxNjE4NDUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rochester investment fund focuses on medtech life sciences startups in region,"The Southeast Minnesota Capital Fund is a small but increasingly popular investment firm focused on funding good ideas in the Rochester startup scene.

While the vast majority of the state's investment funds are headquartered in the Twin Cities Rochester-based SMCF makes seed-stage angel investments in Minnesota startups with a particular focus on companies in the southeast corner of the state.

Rochester is replete with young businesses in the life sciences and medical-technology space a direct result of the world-class Mayo Clinic. The fund's managers David Herbert and Harry Hoffman are both Mayo veterans who saw an opportunity to build a local funding source.

""There wasn't a source of equity capital here. ... We're helping to provide that"" Hoffman said.

Its first fund launched in 2017 invested nearly $2 million in 14 startup companies. Ten of those are either in the Rochester area or are based on technologies originally developed there.

SMCF launched its second fund in February. Herbert expects to close with up to 100 investors and commitments exceeding $5 million. Investors have been committing larger amounts more quickly than expected he said.

Herbert had leadership roles for Mayo Clinic Ventures Mayo Clinic Labs and Mayo Clinic Global Business Solutions. Hoffman spent 25 years as Mayo's chief investment officer and treasurer.

Typical investments from the new fund will be in the range of $200000 to $500000 Hoffman said. This could include follow-on investments in promising companies.

Herbert and Hoffman screen and select potential companies. Investors then get to hear the company's pitch and ask questions before giving Herbert and Hoffman feedback.

""It is a very different model. ... Everyone feels engaged"" said Herbert. ""I think people like the idea of making an investment that goes to help a company grow.""

One of those companies is Vyriad Inc. formed in 2015 which develops viruses to be used as a new form of cancer therapy. The development of the concept started at Mayo Clinic through the research of Dr. Stephen Russell now CEO of Vyriad.

Vyriad signed a deal in late 2019 with New York-based Regeneron Pharmaceuticals a large industry player for a research collaboration to co-develop viruses.

Russell said SMCF was among a large group of investors in Vyriad during a $10 million fundraising round.

""The reason I was so keen to get [SMCF] involved is that they're the movers and shakers in Rochester"" said Russell. ""Getting the local buy-in through that fund [is] very valuable for companies especially in the health care space.""

Ambient Clinical Analytics was co-founded with Mayo Clinic in 2014. The digital health firm which makes clinical analytics software was backed by SMCF from its first fund. Ambient's Sepsis DART product can provide an alert to health care staff when a patient is developing septic shock.

""There's always been a strong base of angel investors in Rochester. This is really expanding on that"" said Al Berning Ambient's CEO of SMCF.

Berning previously co-founded and led Rochester-based Pemstar Inc. an engineering product design manufacturing and fulfillment services company. Pemstar's sales hit $871 million in its last fiscal year before it was sold in 2007.

The second fund will remain open until the end of June or until it hits investor goals.

The new owners also have generations of experience.

EVERETT — Are you a Snohomish County resident? The odds are good you’ll generate three tons of garbage yard waste and recycling this year.

Somebody’s got to pick that up.

For more than a century Rubatino Refuse Removal has been collecting the city of Everett’s trash. It’s been a long haul for the Rubatino family which founded the business in 1907.

Late last year the Rubatinos sold the disposal company to three partners: Stephan Banchero III president of Cedar Grove a Seattle-based organic composting company; Darrick Dietrich president of Pasco-based Basin Disposal; and Marc Torre president of Sunshine Disposal in Spokane.

Together they formed a new ownership group independent of their respective companies.

“The three of us came together separately to make the purchase” Banchero said.

The terms of the deal were not disclosed.

All three buyers are from families that have been in the trash collection business for generations since the late 1930s.

They’re exactly the kind of buyers that 91-year-old Edward Rubatino who joined the family business in 1957 was searching for when he decided to sell the 114-year-old company.

Ed who worked full-time as president through December had spent 64 years on the job.

“My father wanted to keep the business as a family business” said Rose Rubatino Goulet Ed Rubatino’s daughter and a former fourth-generation business owner.

“We just feel that the community is really taken care of in a special way with a family-run business versus an international corporation” Rubatino Goulet said.

The fifth generation has taken a different route Rubatino Goulet said.

“One of my sons is a physician and one sells outdoor equipment.”

On January 1 the new owners took over the Everett company keeping the Rubatino name.

“From a look and feel perspective the business will stay similar” Banchero said. “We look forward to making Everett a solid waste model.”

All the employees continue with the company. Rubatino Goulet retains her part-time position at the firm. Before the sale the business employed about 50 people she said. Many members of the Rubatino family including her husband Larry Goulet have “proudly worked for the business for many many years” she said.

“We’re proud of our relationship with Everett” Rubatino Goulet said. “We want to thank our customers for their loyalty and the support of our company.”

One big family

“The solid waste industry is one big family” said Banchero 39. “We’re a couple of Italian families that go way back. The Rubatino family knew my dad and my grandfather.”

Banchero’s grandfather founded a Seattle garbage collection business in 1938. For years it operated under the name Seattle Disposal.

In 1988 the family invested in an organic recycling facility in Seattle’s Maple Valley. Eleven years later they sold the garbage portion of the business. In 2004 they added a second recycling facility Cedar Grove in Everett.

“We take food and yard waste and turn it into compost” Banchero said.

“Ed wanted to keep the business within a family-owned structure. We were able to provide that” Banchero said. “We are honored to carry the torch for their family and to make them and the city of Everett proud for a long time.”

Darrick Dietrich’s grandfather John Dietrich began hauling garbage in Pasco and Pendleton Oregon when he was 19 years old. A few years later John Dietrich and his brothers bought a trash collection company and moved it to Pasco.

“For Ed what matters most is that we take care of Everett” said Dietrich 50 who travels to the city twice a month. “If he had sold it to a corporation they would have managed it from afar through multiple managers.”

The Torre family started its King County trash collection business in 1938 with horses and wagons said Torre 50 who grew up in Kent.

“We’ve all known each other for a long time” Torre said. “This is an effort to continue the family business. We look forward to providing a high level of service.”

Horse and cart

Three main waste haulers collect trash in Snohomish County: Rubatino Refuse in Everett; Waste Management in Arlington Bothell Brier Edmonds and outside other Snohomish County cities; and Republic Services in Edmonds Lynnwood Snohomish and some east county areas.

Rubatino is the oldest.

Angelo Rubatino and two partners founded the business during a winter “when there was no work” at the Black Diamond coal mines where he worked Rubatino Goulet said of her great grandfather.

“They got a horse and started picking up trash” she said.

The Newcastle mines located in the Cascade Range foothills of King County were largely worked by immigrants from Italy and Wales according to historylink.org

“The work was hard and dangerous and those who could went on to other enterprises” wrote Rita Cipalla who chronicled a history of the mines and miners.

Angelo discovered an out.

A year later in 1908 Angelo asked his son Henry to join the business after the two partners left. They named it H. Rubatino Company doing business as City Scavengers. Around that time Everett which had incorporated in 1893 was a city of 25000 residents a quarter of whom were foreign-born.

Known as the “City of Smokestacks” Everett was dominated by 95 manufacturing plants “including 11 lumber mills 16 shingle mills and 17 mills producing both” according to historylink.org.

Angelo and his son Henry acquired two carts and four draft horses.

“Occasionally the horses would get away running wild in the neighborhood dragging their harnesses” according to one Everett history “In those days garbage men were junk men too. They collected metals glassware and other items. The garbage was hauled to Bayside and barged out into Puget Sound and dumped.”

Drivers pitched in to help fill the city’s potholes Rubatino Goulet said. On trash runs they would pick up “coal clinkers” hard chunks of burnt coal which they used to fill the divots in the road she said.

The Rubatino’s horse and cart likely shared the road with Everett’s Bargreen Coffee Co. which began delivering beans in a horse-drawn wagon in 1898 and the Macomber Farms delivery wagon. Founded in 1906 Macomber is still going strong today.

Later Henry’s brother Fred joined the business and then his son Tom “and then my dad Ed and then me” Rubatino Goulet said.

In 1937 the Rubatinos replaced the horses with a fleet of garbage trucks. It caused a bit of commotion among the company’s drivers Rubatino Goulet said.

Suddenly they had to learn their routes she said. Until then they relied on the horses to turn onto the right street and pull up to the right house.

“The horses had just known where to stop” she said.

The company continued to operate under the name City Scavengers until 1967 when it was changed to Rubatino Refuse Removal. Scooter service began in 1968. The zippy little scooters that can navigate tight alleyways and side streets are old “meter maid trucks that have been stretched and modified” Rubatino Goulet said.

Disposable consumerism

Until the 19th century Industrial Revolution the small amount of household waste produced was “mostly organic such as food scraps” according to a 2021 Snohomish County report.

“Clothing was patched until it was no longer wearable and then the scraps were used as rags or sewn together for other uses” the report said.

The advent of disposable mass-produced consumer goods — from shoes to paper napkins — boosted the amount of garbage produced by a single household.

Private companies unearthed a lucrative niche hauling trash.

Smaller towns and villages on the other hand sometimes depended on “piggeries” small pig farms to dispose of food waste. Just 75 pigs could consume about a ton of food waste each day.”

In 1880 less than a quarter of American cities had any kind of organized solid waste collection system. By the time the Rubatinos launched their business in 1907 about two-thirds of the American cities offered some sort of trash collection service.

It would be another 60 years before the United States enacted waste collection regulations. In 1965 Congress passed the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Before then waste was usually burned on site in barrels or pits or sent to landfills.

In Washington recycling services began with the 1989 passage of the Waste Not Washington Act which introduced curbside recycling.

“By the end of the twentieth century waste management had become a combination of science and art” the Snohomish County report said.

According to Rubatino Goulet her grandfather always said “You make your living in the community you give back to that community.”

Henry Rubatino was president of the Sons of Italy in Everett and served 25 years on the board of Catholic Community Service. Ed Rubatino and Rubatino Goulet also served on the board. Both are members of the Everett Rotary Club and are past presidents.

“When you have your name on the side of your truck” Ed Rubatino said “you want to do the best you can in your community.”

Two decades ago the Rushville hospital about 50 miles southeast of Indianapolis was on the verge of bankruptcy with expenses far outstripping patient revenue. In a move to stay afloat it reduced the number of inpatient beds from 52 to 25 cutting overhead and allowing it to get slightly higher federal reimbursements as a critical-access hospital. Then it began looking for partnerships to help it support expensive service lines from oncology to helicopter service.

So far the strategy has worked allowing the hospital to stay open when many other rural hospitals across the nation have closed.

“I’ve seen small communities that have lost their hospitals and it hurts them economically and it hurts them from a service standpoint” Wilkinson said. The Rush County commissioner and longtime resident of nearby Knightstown has used the hospital’s emergency room and walk-in clinics.

Rural hospitals have long struggled to stay afloat serving populations that are older less healthy and less affluent than those of their urban counterparts. Nearly 130 rural hospitals across the nation have shut their doors since 2010.

But now the sector is facing another wave of closings under additional financial pressures some caused by the pandemic that has strained resources.

Fourteen of Indiana’s 54 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closing because of continuing financial losses and lack of financial reserves to sustain operations according to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.

Nationally more than 500 rural hospitals—or more than one-fourth of the rural hospitals in the country—are at immediate risk of closing the study said.

The report does not name those hospitals. But a database included in the study shows that 19 of Indiana’s rural hospitals scattered across the state have been operating at a loss over a recent three-year period some of them with a negative profit margin in the teens.

The list includes small county-owned hospitals and community hospitals owned by large health care systems such as Indiana University Health Ascension St. Vincent and Franciscan Health—although none of those systems say they plan to close any hospitals.

“We have no plans to close our rural facilities” IU Health spokesman Jeff Swiatek said in an email to IBJ. “IU Health has made a commitment to each of these communities to be a long-term partner in improving their health outcomes.”

Harold D. Miller president of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform said the organization doesn’t “release the names of the individual hospitals because we don’t want to label a specific hospital as being at risk of closing when it may have a recovery plan in place or to label a hospital as not at risk when more recent data would show it’s having problems.”

The study comes after another report issued in 2020 by the Chartis Center for Rural Health also forecast a new wave of closures over the next few years.

That study said 44% of rural hospitals were then operating in the red and the pandemic was placing a significant strain on resources staffing and expertise.

“Key services are disappearing across rural America and the emergence of COVID-19 magnifies the lack of access to intensive care unit beds in these communities” the report said. “The pandemic threatens to further weaken the viability of rural hospitals.”

Low reimbursements

Financial pressures at many rural hospitals include a low percentage of patients with private insurance and a lack of high-margin service lines such as neurosurgery and orthopedic surgery due to limited demand.

On top of that the nation’s hospitals are facing an end to federal pandemic aid packages ending an important lifeline for many weak players. And a suspension in Medicare reimbursement reductions put in place last year is set to end this month meaning Medicare reimbursements will be cut 1% this month and 2% in July.

For rural hospitals which depend heavily on Medicare reimbursements the upcoming cuts could mean a loss in millions of dollars in patient revenue. Many rural hospitals already operate close to the edge making any additional cuts hard to sustain.

“They generally have poor patient mixes—too many uninsured Medicaid and Medicare patients and too few with private insurance with its far higher reimbursement rates” said Nicolas Terry executive director at the Center for Law and Health at Indiana University’s Robert H. McKinney School of Law.

“Because of their size they also struggle to offer services that attract higher reimbursement because of relatively low demand for specialty services because of smaller populations” he added.

Rural hospital patients are often farmers small-business owners retail workers and shop workers. The hospitals usually offer basic service lines including emergency general surgery and rehabilitation therapy.

In emergencies rural patients often travel twice as far as urban residents to get to the closest hospital according to the Indiana Hospital Association. As a result although only 20% of Americans live in rural areas they account for 60% of trauma deaths.

Spared so far

So far Indiana has been largely spared from rural-hospital closures. Since 2005 only two rural Indiana hospitals have closed: St. Joseph’s Hospital in Huntingburg (2007) and Fayette Regional Health in Connersville (2019).

During the same time Texas lost 24 rural hospitals Tennessee lost 16 North Carolina lost 10 and Kentucky lost five according to the Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina.

But hospital officials here say Indiana is not immune from additional closures.

Susan Jo Thomas Brian Tabor

“There are facilities on the brink” said Brian Tabor president of the Indiana Hospital Association. “It could be a matter of time before there are many more.”

Some health groups say they are concerned that more rural hospitals could close in coming years.

“It’s devastating if a community loses its hospital” said Susan Jo Thomas executive director of Covering Kids and Families a not-for-profit focused on access to health care. “They will never get business back because businesspeople looking to settle in an area want good access to health care for their employees.”

The Indiana Rural Health Association said hospitals outside of metropolitan areas often have slim profit margins even in the best of times. The pandemic which has caused staffing shortages and stretched resources has just exacerbated the situation said Cara Veale the association’s CEO.

“We often provide services that have lower reimbursement anyway—a lot of the preventive care as opposed to the high-dollar services like open-heart surgery” she said.

Brenda Reetz

Brenda Reetz CEO of Greene County General Hospital in Linton southeast of Terre Haute said rural hospitals usually operate on such small margins “that any little hiccup in the process can have a very huge impact on the hospital.”

Her hospital has been operating on a break-even to negative operating margin for most of the eight years she has been CEO. Still it has managed to keep most of its service lines including obstetrics and maternity.

“A lot of rural hospitals have closed their OB service line so they’re not delivering babies anymore” Reetz said. “We evaluate that probably on an annual basis but it’s something we feel very strongly is necessary to have here. … But it’s hard. It’s not a profitable service line.”

‘No plans to close’

Many large hospital systems in Indiana that operate rural hospitals say they are committed to keeping the doors open even at the locations that are losing money.

Some observers say it’s a smart strategy since the rural hospitals can add as feeders for the big system’s high-revenue service lines such as heart surgery and most complicated trauma cases which can be performed at the system’s Level 1 trauma centers in the big cities.

David Blish

“They feed patients and cases to the mothership” said David Blish director of health care consulting at Katz Sapper & Miller an Indianapolis-based accounting and consulting firm.

IU Health the state’s largest hospital system operates seven rural hospitals from Monticello to Paoli. It said rural hospitals need big partners to help them reduce costs and add efficiencies by sharing staff expertise training and other resources.

Franciscan Health which operates two rural hospitals in Indiana one each in Crawfordsville and Rensselaer said it has no plans to close any hospitals.

“These centers provide vital care to people who don’t have access to essential medical services such as a hospital a primary care clinic or an emergency room” spokesman Joe Stuteville wrote in an email.

Ascension St. Vincent which operates six rural hospitals did not directly say whether it would keep them all open. But it said it is working to address rural health care challenges such as a shortage of doctors and nurses by offering internships shadowing opportunities and scholarships.

“Rural hospitals are crucial for communities across Indiana and Ascension St. Vincent is committed to providing care close to home for patients” spokeswoman Emily Garrett wrote in an email.

And the top leaders at several community rural hospitals echoed those sentiments even though they don’t have large hospital systems behind them. Some have been able to find additional revenue streams sometimes by buying nursing homes and diverting part of that patient revenue to the hospital. Other times they expand their food service parking or other non-patient services.

At Rush Memorial Hospital for example officials say the financial pressure to provide services without losing money is relentless. Recently a patient came in for hand surgery a complex operation that normally costs about $30000.

Brad Smith

The biggest part of that expense was about $19000 for the implants which the hospital had to buy from a vendor said Brad Smith the hospital’s CEO. But the patient was on Medicaid and that federal program does not reimburse for implants. It paid only $3000 for the operation he said.

“We couldn’t do too many of those and keep our doors open” said Smith who has led Rush Memorial for 18 years.

Rush Memorial was on the verge of bankruptcy when Smith joined the operation as chief financial officer in 1998. The hospital had already closed its obstetrics unit in the late 1980s to save money.

If the hospital failed patients in Rushville would have to travel dozens of miles to another hospital in New Castle Shelbyville or Greensburg.

Critical access

In the early 2000s the federal government became so alarmed at the high number of rural hospitals closing that it came out with a “critical access hospital” designation to help the most needy stay afloat.

To qualify hospitals would have to have 25 or fewer acute-care inpatient beds be at least 35 miles from the nearest hospital and provide around-the-clock emergency care. Hospitals that won critical-access status could get a slightly higher reimbursement on Medicare services.

Rush Memorial decided to go that route even though it meant taking more than half of its 52 licensed beds out of service—many of which were empty most days anyway.

The hospital looked for nontraditional ways to bring in new services. It set up a partnership with Ascension St. Vincent to provide helicopter service across the region. Specialists from Franciscan Health provide oncology care and IU Health offers telehealth psychiatry service for the emergency room.

“I’ve tried to partner with as many systems as possible to bring specialty care that I couldn’t do on my own” said Smith who chairs the state hospital association.

Over the past three years Rush Memorial has come close to the financial brink with an average profit margin of just 1.8%. It had 337 patient discharges last year making it one of Indiana’s smaller hospitals.

But keeping the hospital open was more important than just providing medical care. Rush Memorial is one of the largest employers in the county with about 350 full-time-equivalent workers.

Community leaders have pushed to keep the hospital on an even keel from offering business advice to promoting hospital events. In the past few years the hospital has added a handful of new specialties including knee and hip replacements and is roughing out plans to expand its surgery department the emergency room rehabilitation services and medical office building space.

“The community supports any type of fundraising event the hospital might have” said Wilkinson the county commissioner. “… We’ve worked hard as a community to maintain this hospital. And we certainly would like to keep it.”•",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjMTduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDQvMDIvbWlkLW1pc3NvdXJpLXdhc3RlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtY2VudGVycy1oZWxwLWNvbW11bml0eS1tZW1iZXJzLXdpdGgtc3ByaW5nLWNsZWFuaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mid-Missouri waste management centers help community members with spring cleaning,"COLUMBIA MO (KMIZ)

Columbia and Jefferson City is starting off April with some spring waste cleaning and collections.

Every first and third Saturday from April until November community members will get to drop off household hazardous waste items free of charge in Columbia.

This Saturday was the first day community members could drop off household hazardous waste items at sites in the city.

The collection took place at the site on Lakeview Ave. between 8 a.m. and noon Saturday. The city’s volunteers said about 300 vehicles stopped by on Saturday but that's a slow day for them. They said they usually see anywhere between 400 to 500 vehicles dropping off items.

Once individuals drive up they will be met by volunteers and split into two lines depending on the items they have. The allowed disposable items range from motor oil paints aerosol cans and ammunition.

The collection facility recycled paint can also save you money. A small crew of people stir the multiple cans of latex paint to check for solids. If none is found the paint is put into five-gallon buckets and is later given to residents for free.

According to paintzen a gallon of paint can cost up to $40 for quality paint equalling a potential $200 savings.

Steve Moore is one resident who drove 20 miles from Harrisburg to drop off items. He said he wanted to set an example for his daughter. ""Teaching her that it's better to take care of our environment than just throwing stuff out is much better” Moore said.

Brenda Peculis is one individual who said she been volunteering at the HHW Facility for about two years to show her dedication to helping the environment.

“When they just throw things into the landfill  critters go through landfill they drag things out. It rains the water washes all of that nasty stuff into the ground and it ends up in our water supply so we end up drinking everything we throw away to some degree” Peculis said.

Laura Cooper is new to Columbia and says she was amazed by the accessibility.

“We just loaded up some paint that the previous owners had left in our basement and um a container of antifreeze and we pulled right up and they took it"" Cooper said.

If you are in Jefferson City their bulky-item pick up will be Monday if you live on west side of Highway 54 and April 11 if you live on the east side.

Items can be placed on the curb no earlier than the Sunday before your scheduled pick-up date and no later than 5 a.m. on Monday. You will only be allowed to bring large items such as TV’s and furniture to your curb for pick up.

Justin Sullivan | Getty Images

Starting Monday Google is bringing most employees back to assigned physical offices three days a week. The company has said since the beginning of the pandemic that it eventually wants people to return. A lot of workers don't understand why and they expressed their concerns at a recent all-hands meeting. “Google made record profits through the pandemic"" CEO Sundar Pichai said reading from a question submitted by an employee and upvoted by many others on Google's internal board called Dory. ""Why is the RTO policy not work from office when you want to or when it makes sense to?"" Google's balancing act is shared by many employers particularly as surging gas prices make long drives and traffic jams even more unappealing than they were two years ago. Tech companies in particular have outperformed during the pandemic thanks in part to a wide array of cloud-based collaboration tools. Employees have gotten used to the flexibility and family time. Companies now face a test to see how employees will react as some optional work situations become mandatory and the labor market continues to tighten. Megan Slabinski of consulting and staffing firm Robert Half said two-thirds of employers say they want workers back in a ""near full-time capacity"" and half of employees say they'd look for a new job if that was required. “It’s fascinating the level of disconnect between employers and employees"" said Slabinski who oversees the Pacific Northwest Colorado Utah and Northern California as district president for Robert Half.

Walking it back

Some companies have already changed their policies several times leading up to their office return. In June Amazon walked back its original return plan telling corporate workers it would allow them to come back to the office three days a week instead of full time. The company said it was “learning and evolving as we go."" In October Amazon said the decision will be left to individual teams. Microsoft and Google added 30-day ""transition"" periods to ease workers back into their new schedule. Last spring when Google first tried bringing employees back to the office before Covid-19 cases spiked again the company said employees could apply to work remotely for up to 12 months but would be approved only in “the most exceptional circumstances.” They could also be get called back to an assigned office at any point. Leadership has since lightened its tone. Google says it has approved 85% of requests for relocation or permanent remote work.

“You’re grownups and we trust you to do what’s right for you your families and your life while respecting the new baseline” Prabhakar Raghavan who oversees search ads and commerce wrote recently in a memo to employees. “We don’t expect 100% fidelity to the 3-2 hybrid work week 24x7.” At the all-hands meeting Pichai said “there’s a real desire for people to communicate and collaborate so we’re trying to balance all of that” according to audio obtained by CNBC. “We’ll keep taking a close look at all of this"" he said. One reason for the partial return Pichai said is for people to get to know their colleagues. “We hired so many people over the last two years who just don’t have a sense of how the company works"" he said. Even Twitter  which announced in 2020 that employees could work remotely ""forever"" told staffers last month that ""distributed working will be much much harder."" CEO Parag Agrawal who replaced Jack Dorsey late last year said he had hoped to see people in the office because in-person work will ""bring that culture to life in such a powerful way.""

Wait and see

Slabinski said some companies are waiting to see what their peers do before making any big decisions. Amazon for example hasn't announced a new return date. “I think there’s an element of someone has to go first to require people back” Slabinski said. “Amazon backed away when they started seeing attrition and now Google is requiring people to be back on site and it’s like hoping the rest of the industry joins in and it won’t become reason for resignations."" Another challenge for employers involves syncing up schedules. Apple designated Mondays Tuesdays and Thursdays as in-office days. Other tech companies have kept their plans vague.

watch now

Colin Yasukochi executive director of real estate firm CBRE said he expects the San Francisco commercial real estate market to get more competitive in the second and third quarters when there's a better sense of demand. “They’re all sort of moving cautiously because they don’t really want to lose key employees” said Yasukochi adding that some people end up not seeing the point of going in when they experience the emptiness of it the office. “There’s nothing worse than 'Oh I made this effort to come in and put on real pants today and I’m the only one in’” Yasukochi said. He said his San Francisco CBRE office is at 20% to 30% capacity ""on a good day.""

‘Rolling the dice’

Retention and employee satisfaction are more critical than ever across the tech sector as record numbers of people in the U.S. are quitting their jobs and exploring new opportunities. Forcing people to commute is an added risk. ""They’re rolling the dice and it’s a gamble I'm not sure I'd want to make in this environment” Slabinski said. Smaller companies could have an upper hand for talent she added. “They could really differentiate their opportunities where maybe they can’t compete for comp but they could offer flexibility and trust"" said Slabinski. Google is falling back on one of its best tricks: perks.

The Hurricanes ranked third during last week’s SBPLI Long Island Regional #1 in Hempstead with a record of 16-2-0. They also clenched the competition’s Creativity Award sponsored by Rockwell Automation for their robot’s design elements that allowed for flawless climbing on inclined monkey bars coach Tony Kryl said.

The team’s alliance captain Team R.I.C.E. from Southold High School selected the Hurricanes as their first pick to join them in the First Championship 2022 an international competition that begins April 20 in Houston.

Before they can head to H-town however the team must raise funds for transportation meals lodging and other trip-related expenses.

Heading into each competition season Kryl explained the team typically starts with a $20000 budget with room to raise addition funds. However the well dried up this year.

“We had to start from scratch this year and due to COVID we really were lacking in funding” Kryl said. “Everybody was hurting and we didn’t want to solicit businesses due to that so we kind of struggled along this whole year with funding. We set up the GoFundMe to get help to get these kids to Houston.”

As of Saturday the GoFundMe raised just over $24000 slightly more than halfway to its $40000 goal.

Kryl is confident the team will reach it’s goal and prevent costs from falling on students and their families.

“It looks like we are a go but we are still looking for donations for the team for the Hurricane Robotics booster team to try to alieviate the costs of this because it’s very big” he said. “We can’t ask the kids to pay $1000 each.”

Tough competition

While raising funds is a barrier to entry the team’s bigger challenge awaits in Houston.

In previous competition seasons alliances select three teams to head to the world championship. With COVID-19 restrictions in place however the seeding was cut to two.

“Because First made the cut of the third robot when we go to world’s this is the elite of the elite robots going to world championship” Kryl said. “This is probably going to be the toughest competition we’ve ever been in because in my 22 seasons of doing this I’ve never seen this happen were they’ve cut the third robot out. They’re making it a very elite event based in Houston.”",,,,,,,,,

Tonight's WrestleMania 38 Night One event saw Rhodes make his return as the opponent for Seth Rollins hand-picked by WWE Chairman & CEO Vince McMahon as the storyline goes. Rhodes defeated Rollins in tonight's return match.

Rhodes had a special entrance as he was raised from under the stage. He was introduced as ""The American Nightmare"" and received pyro and a huge pop on his way to the ring. The back & forth match ended with two straight CrossRhodes the signature right hands and Bionic Elbow of the late WWE Hall of Famer Dusty Rhodes and then one more CrossRhodes for the pin to win. The announcers did acknowledge how Cody has been away from WWE and how he's wrestled around the world but there was no mention of AEW.

This was Cody's first WWE match since May 16 2016 when he lost to Zack Ryder at a WWE Superstars taping while working as Stardust. Rhodes helped launch AEW as a talent and Executive Vice President but left the company back in February after his contract expired and he was unable to agree on a new deal with AEW President Tony Khan.

Rhodes is reportedly scheduled to be a regular member of the RAW roster moving forward. It's been reported that he signed his new WWE contract around three weeks ago.

Stay tuned for more from WrestleMania Saturday and more on Rhodes in WWE. Below are several shots of tonight's return at AT&T Stadium in Arlington TX:

In the weeks leading up to WrestleMania 38 speculation has been rampant about The American Nightmare returning to the company. Although reports have indicated that Rhodes is signed and scheduled to wrestle Seth Rollins at WrestleMania WWE has yet to confirm anything.

Speaking to Wrestling Inc AJ Styles was asked about the rumors of Rhodes potentially returning to the company. Styles brushed these rumors aside stating that he won't believe it until he sees it:

“Listen I haven’t seen Cody here so I’ll believe it when I see it. This is what we’ve been a part of for a couple well I’ve been decades. There’s a lot of rumors but you don’t believe something until you actually see it. So if Cody is going to be at WrestleMania I will believe it when I see it.”

AJ Styles is a veteran of over 20 years so he's likely seen enough in the wrestling business to know when to keep a level head. Besides The Phenomenal One has plenty more to worry about as he's set to face Edge for the first time at WrestleMania 38.

AJ Styles speaks out on rumors reports and speculation

Expand Tweet

Styles is no stranger to rumors and speculation. In the weeks leading up to his own debut in WWE reports were flying about him potentially signing with the company.

Speaking to Wrestling Inc The Phenomenal one said that he's bothered by websites publishing news from only one inside source. He expressed his incredulity regarding news and rumors that have come from a single person:

“The only thing that bothers me about most websites and whatnot is they get their information from one guy. He has to be the truth right? I guess that bothers me. Because you’ve got to get your own truths from people that you have sources with that’s the only thing that bothers me. But that’s not on you guys.”

Regardless of whether the rumors of Cody Rhodes' return are true WrestleMania is packed with high-profile matches and segments in a two-night extravaganza. With information scarce on Seth Rollins' mystery opponent fans will have to wait and see if any bombastic debuts take place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpdmVtZXNwb3J0LmNvbS84Nzk5MTQ0MC13d2Utd3Jlc3RsZW1hbmlhLTM4LWNvZHktcmhvZGVzLW1ha2VzLWhpZ2hseS1hbnRpY2lwYXRlZC1yZXR1cm4tdG8tZmFjZS1zZXRoLXJvbGxpbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE WrestleMania 38: Cody Rhodes makes highly-anticipated return to face Seth Rollins,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpdmVtZXNwb3J0LmNvbS84Nzk5MTQ0MC13d2Utd3Jlc3RsZW1hbmlhLTM4LWNvZHktcmhvZGVzLW1ha2VzLWhpZ2hseS1hbnRpY2lwYXRlZC1yZXR1cm4tdG8tZmFjZS1zZXRoLXJvbGxpbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyZXN0bGluZ2luYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA0L3d3ZS13cmVzdGxlbWFuaWEtMzgtbmlnaHQtb25lLWxpdmUtcmVzdWx0cy1hbmQtdmlld2luZy1wYXJ0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE WrestleMania 38 Night One Live Results And Viewing Party,"WWE WrestleMania 38 Night One Results – New Champions Crowned Steve Austin Returns More

I feel such a responsibility to carry the name and the whole thing finally felt like 'you know what? I can do it.' I am no longer going to be the Ugly Duckling of the family.

It’s all part of Houston’s plan in the waning days of the 2021-22 season to prioritize minutes for younger prospects and perhaps to bolster its 2022 NBA draft positioning.

However Wood Eric Gordon and Dennis Schroder are still with the team and attending games particularly with the Rockets on a four-game homestand at Toyota Center. So on Friday even though Wood wasn’t present between the lines he had a front-row seat on the bench.

That gave him an up close and personal view (perhaps too personal) of Friday’s most memorable moment. It occurred in the third quarter when a streaker wearing nothing but shoes black socks and an American flag Speedo stormed the court leading to a brief disruption. Ultimately he was slammed to the ground by security officers who then carried him away in the air holding his arms and legs.

“That was my first time witnessing a man go streaking during a game. Please never again” Wood tweeted with a nauseated-face emoji.

By contrast Kings center Damian Jones said postgame that he found the incident “pretty funny.” That said he may have been in a better mood because unlike Wood his team ultimately won the game.

That was my first time witnessing a man go streaking during a game .. please never again🤢 — Christian Wood (@Chriswood_5) April 2 2022

The streaker appears to have been Seabass Perez a professional bodyboarder from California. Perez who posted pictures of the incident to his 44000-plus followers on Instagram posted a video to his account last weekend of him stripping down to the same American flag Speedo outfit and jumping on a counter inside a Ross Dress for Less Store.

Further disciplinary measures against Perez who was taken off to loud cheers by fans were not immediately announced by the Rockets or NBA.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbmJhL2hvdXN0b24tcm9ja2V0cy92aWRlby1zdHJlYWtlci1wdW1tZWxlZC1ieS1zZWN1cml0eS1kdXJpbmctbmJhLWdhbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video: Streaker Pummeled By Security During NBA Game,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://thespun.com/nba/houston-rockets/video-streaker-pummeled-by-security-during-nba-game on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbmJhL2hvdXN0b24tcm9ja2V0cy92aWRlby1zdHJlYWtlci1wdW1tZWxlZC1ieS1zZWN1cml0eS1kdXJpbmctbmJhLWdhbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

There's plenty of other changes and developments you should be aware of from this past week so here's a look at a few of them that you should know about.

If you ever have a news tip feel free to email it to [email protected] for possible inclusion in a future update!

Michael Bayley comments on CDC removing travel warning

The big cruise news this week was when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) took down its warning against going on a cruise ship due to Covid-19.

In a nutshell the CDC eliminated its travel warning of contracting Covid-19 on a cruise ship. The warning had been in place for two years.

Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael Bayley shared his thoughts on the change during a panel at the Cruise360 conference this week.

Cruise360 is an annual travel agent conference and Mr. Bayley was speaking on a panel when the topic came up.

As you might imagine Mr. Bayley was quite happy with the warning being removed ""This is great news. The fact that they removed the warning is a very positive step for our industry.""

""We’ve been on a very long journey with the CDC.""

""Now when a consumer wants to find out about COVID-19 on cruise ships they can go to the CDC’s websites and get the facts without being scared away by a warning.""

Every ship is now in the app

Royal Caribbean added Radiance of the Seas to Royal Caribbean's app which means now every ship in the fleet has app support.

Ever since Royal Caribbean's app debuted the company has systematically been adding app support to each ship. Since 2021 more ships have gotten app support correlating to restart plans.

Getting emuster and check-in support necessitated having the app ready for when a ship would start sailing again.

ArriveCAN ready for cruise ship passengers

When Royal Caribbean announced its Alaska cruise health protocols it noted passengers will need to use the ArriveCAN app for all sailings from Seattle Seward and Vancouver.

All travelers to Canada or their legal guardians must download the ArriveCAN app or complete the mandatory travel information via the ArriveCAN website prior to your entry into Canada.

In the 2.27.2 update to ArriveCAN the app now supports ""marine travelers"".

According to the app update cruisers can enter their date and time of embarkation from their country of origin no earlier than 72 hours prior to departure. In addition cruisers can make ArriveCAN submissions 30 days prior to arrival.

The ArriveCAN app can be downloaded on the Apple App Store or Google Play.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pYW1paGVyYWxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NvbW11bml0eS9mbG9yaWRhLWtleXMvYXJ0aWNsZTI1ODU1NjA3OC5odG1s0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubWlhbWloZXJhbGQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY29tbXVuaXR5L2Zsb3JpZGEta2V5cy9hcnRpY2xlMjU4NTU2MDc4Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How a fight over cruise ships visiting Key West has changed tourism in a tourist city,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.miamiherald.com', port=443): Read timed out.

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

""’I’m the best decision your organization has ever made’"" Ross said.

But Ross wasn’t done.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

PATRIOTS' JEROD MAYO DOUBTS TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY QUARTERBACK FOR HIS OLD TEAM

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

Brady likely knew there were going to be some things said that he might not like but he seemed to want the subject of the jokes to stay with him not his former owner.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWFjY291bnRhbnQtamVmZnJleS1zLW1jY29ubmV5LW9uLWhpcy1zdG9ybXktZGFuaWVscy1jb3ZlcnVwLW5vdGVzLWktbWFkZS1hLWJvby1ib2_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump Accountant on His Stormy Daniels Coverup Notes: 'I Made a Boo-Boo',"Jurors who will determine Donald Trump’s fate got their first look at the damning paperwork tying the former president to his porn star hush-money coverup with testimony from the buffoon accountant who took notes of a meeting that set it in motion.

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S.F.'s Valencia Street merchants endorse replacing center bikeway with protected side-running lanes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/s-f-valencia-street-bicycle-lane-19442272.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vaGFtbWVyLW11c2V1bS1hbm4tcGhpbGJpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Who's Who of L.A.'s Art World Bids Farewell to a Champion,"The actor Owen Wilson chatted with the artist Ed Ruscha.

Next is Chief Operating Officer (Private and Public Company) finalist Russel Craig who’s senior vice president and COO for global public sector at Salesforce. Here he talks recent key achievements taking professional risks career advice and more.

What key achievements did you have in 2021/2022?

Salesforce made the strategic decision in 2019 to create a global public sector business unit. We had been successful in North America and they wanted to use the expertise we had built working with governments in the U.S. and Canada to digitally transform their missions. With the onset of the pandemic in 2021 the challenge for me and my operations team was to support the global expansion of our public sector expertise and enable our sales teams to meet the demands of our government customers. These efforts enabled them to address a global crisis that only governments can. Salesforce doubled our personnel over 2021/2022. My team worked hard to onboard train and support that global initiative. We are still trying to catch our breath!

What has made you successful in your current role?

Diversity of experience by that I mean the opportunity I had to work cross-functionally with different departments. Early in my career I was a mergers and acquisitions analyst creating financial models to value potential acquisitions. The due diligence process provided me with exposure to the inter workings of different organizations. Working the integration of two corporate entities enabled me to view the different business processes that companies utilized and provided insight to areas of the business that were different than finance. Areas like marketing sales IT engineering real estate marketing and others. I have remained interested in working and collaborating cross-functionally ever since.

What are you most proud of having been a part of in your current organization?

COVID was a shock to the world something that had not been seen in 100 years. Only governments have the breadth to address such a global issue. Salesforce worked with government health departments and ministries to adapt our products and services to aid in contact tracing vaccine management and other human services.

This required us to adapt top to bottom. We had to quickly change not only our products but our pricing contracts policies and procedures to aid in the mission that governments were undertaking. It was very rewarding to have been even a small part of the global response to the pandemic.

What’s the biggest professional risk you’ve ever taken?

I spent the first 10 or so years of my career in the telecom industry. That was during the initial rollout of wireless it was a very exciting time. With the velocity of that industry at that time I moved my family several times from New Jersey to Arizona to Chicago to Maryland. It was very difficult on my family especially when my children reached school age.

I was living in Maryland and I was asked to relocate again. I had to say no and that meant leaving the company where I was working. Since I was near D.C. I decided I needed to learn the public sector and federal government industry if I wanted to raise my family here. So at the mid-point in my career I changed roles and industries. I was lucky to get an opportunity with the federal division of a technology company and I have been in this sector for the last 20+ years.

What’s your best career advice for those who want to follow in your footsteps?

Imagine being able to tell a machine to write an app simply by telling it what the app does. As far-fetched as it may appear this scenario is already a reality.

According to Salesforce AI Research conversational AI programming is a new paradigm that brings this vision to life thanks to an AI system that builds software.

Introducing CodeGen: Creating Programs from Prompts

The large-scale language model CodeGen which converts simple English prompts into executable code is the first step toward this objective. The person doesn’t write any code; instead (s)he describes what (s)he wants the code to perform in normal language and the computer does the rest.

Conversational AI refers to technologies that allow a human and a computer to engage naturally through a conversation. Chatbots voice assistants and virtual agents are examples of conversational AI.

A Different Kind of Coding Problem: Learning a New Language

Up till now there have been two ways to get computers to do valuable work –

use pre-existing computer programs that do what you want the machine to do

write a new program to do it.

Option 1 is great when the computer programs that are needed are available.

But Option 2 has a built-in barrier: if the type of program needed does not exist creating new programs has always been limited to those who can speak the computer’s language.

Here are three of the present programming paradigm’s key drawbacks:

Time-consuming: one must learn a programming language and correctly apply what they’ve learned.

Difficult: some people find learning a new language to be a difficult task and other people fail to complete the training.

Costly: Coding schools are pretty expensive.

These issues frequently obstruct or discourage new programmers’ education and development particularly among people from historically disadvantaged communities. To put it another way traditional programming often presents people with a distinct kind of “code difficulty” — one that isn’t posed on a test but rather a formidable real-world challenge that many people cannot overcome.

The CodeGen Approach: Make Coding as Simple as Speaking

CodeGen makes programming as simple as talking which is the great promise of conversational AI programming. The conversational AI programming implementation offers a glimpse into the future of democratizing software engineering for the general public. An “AI assistant” converts English descriptions into usable Python code – allowing anyone to write code even if they have no programming experience. This conversational paradigm is enabled by the underlying language model CodeGen which will be made open source to speed up research.

CodeGen’s Two Faces: For Non-Coders and Programmers alike

While anyone including non-coders can use CodeGen to create the software from scratch it can benefit in some circumstances to have some programming experience. Knowing coding ideas for example can help one come up with follow-up commands to offer CodeGen and suggest new directions to go down while writing the code (like using hash maps or recursion – or not using these techniques).

While the objective is to produce ideal programs for any problem by simply telling the computer what you want and not having to know how to code the reality is that learning how to code can often assist CodeGen in finding a decent solution. This is especially true for more complicated situations where having the user suggest various ways may assist the software in finding a working – or more efficient – solution. Even for seasoned programmers CodeGen enables getting to a working solution faster and easier and allows rapid exploration of other approaches. In other words CodeGen is advantageous to programmers of all levels.

Why Conversational AI Programming is Important: Societal Benefits and Impact

While programming is a valuable ability now it will be a must in many tech positions in the coming decade. Every part of society requires more and more code and these programs are becoming increasingly sophisticated. As a result solutions like CodeGen (which help speed up the programming process while making it easier and more controllable) should play a key part in finishing increasingly huge coding projects and attracting a new generation of programmers to the field.

Conversational AI programming tools like CodeGen appear destined to become vital to our future both at Salesforce and at other enterprises. But there’s another problem on the horizon: what will happen when future programming needs become so complicated that the talents required to produce them exceed human capabilities? Digital ecosystems are growing into systems with ever-increasing functional complexity and the complexity of these systems may eventually exceed human ability to comprehend let alone design them. Soon there will be a point when projects require technology like conversational AI programming to construct the mega-complex software systems of the future — both on the vast scale needed and at a timescale that would be hard for a team of human programmers to achieve on their own. In other words the fast-increasing code complexity necessitates a paradigm shift.

CodeGen democratizes programming which has societal benefits

Salesforce’s objective includes developing technology that benefits all of society not just the firm and this research does just that. The conversational AI programming revolution that CodeGen represents will help many people. Here are a few illustrations –

Improving equality and fairness – Opening up coding to everyone – democratizing access to the world of programming – will assist in bringing traditionally underserved groups into the world of programming resulting in increased job options and earnings for them.

Education/teaching/learning – Kids will learn to program interactively with the help of “AI teachers” creating worlds and games in their language while learning and absorbing how to transfer their ideas into programming languages.

Engineers data scientists and developers are examples of software professionals. With the help of “AI assistants” software engineers will be able to comprehend the architecture design patterns and essential routes of legacy systems. An artificial pair-programmer aids in the analysis of complexity in space and time security vulnerabilities design patterns refactorings and test generation.

Professionals who are not in the software industry – In collaboration with “AI analysts” business analysts will integrate complex external data sources and systems correlate and standardize data undertake exploratory analysis and illustrate discoveries.

In principle democratizing coding should benefit society as a whole.

Conclusion

Conversational AI programming (coding by talking) flips the traditional notion of writing code for a machine on its head. Rather than needing a human to create code for a computer the machine (automatic programming) generates code for the human through a dialogue between the two (conversational AI). CodeGen uses natural language to solve both simple and challenging issues. With little or no prior programming experience most users can handle very straightforward coding tasks.

More challenging scenarios may necessitate a basic understanding of programming or computer science ideas to assist the system in its quest for a solution (i.e. working code that solves the stated problem). Even for seasoned programmers CodeGen enables getting to a working solution faster and easier and allows rapid exploration of other approaches.

This innovative technique democratizes software development by allowing anyone to create apps with the help of an “AI helper” or “teacher” without having to learn to program in the traditional sense. Opening up coding to everybody will assist in bringing traditionally underserved populations into the programming industry resulting in greater employment options and higher earnings for them.

Lady Gaga is bringing glamour to the 2022 Grammys.

The “House of Gucci” actress hit Sunday’s red carpet in Las Vegas wearing a black-and-white Armani Privé gown with an elegant pleated train.

She accessorized the look with a diamond and morganite Tiffany & Co. Schlumberger Potager Leaves necklace and Tiffany & Co. Schlumberger Nest earrings featuring purple spinels and diamonds.

The “Chromatica” singer 36 has a history of sporting enormous Tiffany gems as she once donned a $30 million diamond necklace to the 2019 Oscars — and forgot to take it off before heading to Taco Bell after the awards show.

Just a few days before the April 3 awards show the Recording Academy announced that Gaga would be performing during the ceremony though she will be missing collaborator Tony Bennett; the crooner has officially retired from performing after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.

Gaga is nominated for six awards this year including Album of the Year for her joint LP with Bennett “Love for Sale.”

The two are also nominated for Record of the Year Best Pop/Duo Performance Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Best Engineered Album Non-Classical and Best Music Video/Film.

It will be Gaga’s first Grammys performance since 2019 and other performers for the night include Olivia Rodrigo BTS Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvdWdoa2VlcHNpZWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvcGpvMDcwMzg10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Timothy Clayton Knight Obituary - Poughkeepsie Journal,"Give to a forest in need in their memory

No awards show boasts a red carpet as bold and boundary-pushing as the Grammys; you’re far more likely to see stars showing up in campy couture or something see-through and plunging than a sophisticated (but safe) black gown or tux.

And 2022’s Trevor Noah-hosted show on Sunday April 3 — which featured performances from fashion favorites like Lady Gaga BTS and Billie Eilish — definitely delivered the sartorial drama.

The company’s representatives will be working the market to develop new licensing partnerships for its HGTV Home Collection brand potentially across the full spectrum of home furnishings.

“We’re looking for product categories that are organic a natural fit and make sense for the brand” Carolann Dunn Discovery’s vice president of consumer products and licensing told Furniture Today.

The network previously had a licensing partnership with Bassett Furniture which expired in 2019 opening the door to new furniture partnerships as well as additional categories across home furnishings.

In outlining the types of partners the network is looking for Dunn cited its existing agreement with Sherwin Williams for premium quality paints currently distributed exclusively through Lowe’s home improvement centers. “That program has been around for 10 years has constantly grown year-over-year and encompasses significant retail real estate and an online shop” Dunn said. “That’s the model we’re looking for.”

She noted that HGTV conducts extensive research on its audience and its brand and in extending the HGTV Home Collection brand into new areas it will look for partners that align with that vision.

“If a company is looking to execute a growth strategy not looking to create a house of brands come to us” Dunn said. “We are where the consumer is looking for inspiration for the whole home. We build business with partners that endure.”

While the company has more detailed closely held criteria on its licensing partnerships Dunn noted that in general there is a preference for companies with well-established manufacturing and sourcing capabilities a record of proven success and strong product design development and sourcing capabilities.

“We also place a premium on impeccable ethics and compliance standards” she noted. “We need to have visibility through the supply chain to make sure the products and working conditions meet ethical standards.”

In terms of where the HGTV brand plays in the marketplace Dunn described HGTV consumers as upscale well-educated women typically aged 25 to 54 who own their own homes. “She has disposable income she’s inspired by the network and with that inspiration she has true purchase intent” Dunn said.

While the brand has applicability across a broad range of home categories Dunn noted that the goal at the outset is to work with companies that have broad manufacturing and sourcing capabilities rather than parsing out the license to myriad category specialists.

“We are very selective. We say no more than we say yes” Dunn explained. “It’s not about a flash in the pan it’s about building businesses that endure. It’s quality vs. quantity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tL2hvbWVzL3dlYmItcGFyay1ob21lLWN1c3RvbS1maXQtZm9yLWNvbWluZy10b2dldGhlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starting from scratch a Webb Park home is custom fit for coming together,"Starting from scratch a Webb Park home is custom fit for coming together | By Riley Bienvenu Bourgeois -

When designer David Coco chose the terracotta shade that covers the walls and crown molding in the dining room of this home in the Webb Park neighborhood he was thinking of authentic Cajun cooking—crawfish étouffée shrimp Creole and jambalaya all of which share a similar shade. But he was also thinking of the gatherings that so often accompany these meals from Sunday dinners to family parties for which the home had been designed.

“This house was supposed to be a downsize” explains Coco who is part of the Dixon Smith Interiors team and had worked with this family on two previous residences. “It’s not a small home but instead of a lot of rooms there are big spaces that are better for family togetherness.”

The transformation of this house into a home ready for get-togethers wasn’t as simple as moving in the furniture—although in the age of the COVID-19-impacted supply chain even that part had its challenges. Rather it had to be built from the ground up after the demolition of the structure that previously occupied the lot.

Enlisting the help of architect Rachel Dansky the homeowners worked on a design that combined aspects from their past homes—such as a foyer that runs through the entire house much like a carriage way—with features like large iron windows expansive living spaces and even a guesthouse. The biggest priority though was that all of their needs—from an office to a theater room—would fit within the framework of a single-story home.

“They wanted everything on one floor since this is the home they plan to retire in” Coco explains noting that rooms like the blue-hued office were designed to one day convert into another bedroom. “Their old house had steep stairs and it just wasn’t going to work for the long term.”

Bertel Cook Jr. Construction took on the job of bringing the design to fruition. No small project this home is striking because of its attention to detail. Coffered ceilings paneling in the bedroom (designed to frame the master bed perfectly) vintage-style bronze hardware and wood floorboards handpicked in Maurepas all come together to create a custom look that speaks to the style of the homeowners.

But Coco notes that style is not static. Working with them over the years Coco has seen their tastes transform with the times. In this house contemporary art covers the walls—much of which was sourced through Ann Connelly Fine Art—and more muted shades replace a previous preference for red.

“There’s a lot of new” Coco says. “But there are still a lot of pieces in the home that were either reupholstered or reused. Not everything has to be brand new to give a house a fresh look.”

In the office Grandma’s chair was given new life with a graphic fabric. An antique-finish teal bed in the guesthouse is accented by panels of blue-and-green butterfly fabric (a favorite of the homeowners and guests alike). And a pair of mismatched side tables finds a new home at either side of the new tufted master bed.

It’s the backdrop of updated and interesting colors that Coco says allows for the seamless coexistence of old and new antique and modern. Benjamin Moore’s “Grandma’s China” covers the walls throughout the home but pops of colors like Sherwin Williams’ “Silver Strand” in the master bedroom Sherwin Williams’ “Unusual Gray” in the office and most strikingly Sherwin Williams’ “Portrait Tone” in the dining room elevate each space. The statement hues are even carried to spaces like the home’s powder room and butler’s pantry with wallpaper in botanical patterns by William Morris.

“I knew we needed something in those spaces and I love William Morris prints because they’re historical” Coco explains noting Morris’ impact on the Art Nouveau movement of the late 1800s and early 1900s. “The homeowner is not indecisive and we knew these prints were it when we saw them.”

The orange-and-blue botanical theme is even carried outside where a bronze fountain by landscape architect Ryan McKnight is like a piece of art over the pool by Russell Pool Company. Blue stone underfoot pulls the pool deck into the color scheme and the large outdoor kitchen and expansive outdoor seating area hark back to the home’s main goal: entertaining. “The house is made for parties” Coco notes.

And as those celebrations ramp back up Coco says he’s excited to see the home the way it was intended: with friends family and good food filling each room.

“Everything in the house is beautiful but it was all picked with comfort durability and functionality in mind” he explains. “The homeowners never want someone to have to ask if they can sit somewhere. I call their vibe sophisticated casual and that’s just the way they are.”

This will be the second time in Driver’s life he has faced murder charges the first stemming from his participation in the killing of 19-year-old Willits man Paul Rodriguez in 1997.

In connection with the death of Naomi Irion Driver also faces charges of kidnapping robbery burglary and destruction of evidence.

Here’s what we know about Naomi Irion’s death so far:

In the early morning of March 12 2022 she was waiting to be picked up by a bus that would take her to work. Surveillance footage would show that a mask-wearing man suspected to be Troy Driver approached Irion’s vehicle took her place as the driver and the pair drove out of the parking lot into the dark.

Three days later on March 15 2022 Irion’s vehicle was found parked near the Sherwin-Williams Western Emulsion Plant less than a mile away from the Walmart Parking lot. LCSO stated that evidence “suggesting Naomi’s disappearance is criminal in nature was located in the vehicle.

On March 25 2022 Troy Driver was under arrest as a suspect in the kidnapping of Irion. A press release from LCSO indicated Driver was being held on charges of kidnapping. They also located a truck they had sought potentially connected to Irion’s disappearance and impounded it for evidence

Four days later Irion was tragically found deceased buried in a remote and shallow grave 150 miles from where she disappeared in Fernley Nevada. LCSO stated a tip led them to a rural location in Washoe Churchill County where forensic teams analyzed the scene and transported her remains for official identification.

When Driver was 17-year-old he was an accessory to the murder of Willits teen Paul Rodriguez. Rodriguez was lured to a rural residence south of town under the auspice of helping fix a vehicle. When he was distracted his then-girlfriend shot him in the head with a shotgun that Driver had stowed nearby.

Driver then worked to load Rodriguez’s 270-pound body into the trunk of a Mercury Cougar. He reportedly used a four-foot-long metal fence post to “leverage the 270-pound man into the cramped space.”

From there Driver and his accomplices drove out Highway 128 and dumped Rodriguez’s body about two miles east of Navarro and buried him in a shallow grave along the roadside. They would abandon Rodriguez’s vehicle on Branscomb Road lighting it on fire as they left.

In the weeks proceeding Driver’s participation in the murder plot he took part in three armed robberies of convenience stores in Ukiah Willits and Rohnert Park. He and another armed with a semi-automatic handgun and a pistol-grip shotgun would steal small amounts of cash and cigarettes using the threat of violence.

Driver’s criminal exploits began even before his teen years. As a 12-year-old he shot a deer out of season and was sentenced to community service. At fourteen he was sentenced to formal probation for multiple residential break-ins stealing multiple firearms and the burglary of a firearms store. Only ten months after getting caught he pointed a pistol at another earning him time at the Shasta Youth Connection facility.



Driver told a parole officer that he robbed stores because it was “easier to rob someone than to work and earn the money.” The Probation Officer called Driver “quite the charmer” who seemed to know “all the right answers.” This conflicted with the reality that while in Mendocino County’s juvenile hall Driver threatened staff refused to follow directions and faked a suicide attempt.

Today the disappearance of Naomi Irion which initially began as a small town missing person investigation has mushroomed into a nationally- followed crime story. Driver now stands accused of the death of an 18-year-old Nevada woman twenty-five years after helping murder a 19-year-old Willits man.

It must be stated that the charges Troy Driver currently faces associated with the disappearance of Naomi Irion have not been proven in a court of law. Driver should be presumed innocent until proven guilty.

Downtown is a canvas for Cavs Browns Guardians

All three major league sports teams in Cleveland have real estate development plans for downtown Cleveland. They are some of the grandest visions that have been put out there. And while some of those plans have been made public most remain a secret because they’re still in the process of refining those plans. Some details are unknown because they depend on the resolution of significant infrastructure investments.

The reason for each plan is of course money. But it’s not just money that’s being sought for the pockets of each team’s billionaire owners. The money from each team’s real estate developments will also help to offset and reduce the amount of public financing to be sought for a new or improved stadium arena and ballpark.

But suffice it to say — if each plan is implemented as it appears they could these real estate developments would dramatically alter the face of downtown Cleveland especially from the Cavaliers’ and Browns’ plans for the city’s two waterfronts. And there was news on both of those waterfront plans in this past week.

A rough sketch of a portion of Bedrock Real Estate’s riverfront plans between Huron Road and the Cuyahoga River. Bedrock was founded by Dan Gilbert owner of the of the Cleveland Cavaliers who play at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse seen at right. All of the owners of Cleveland’s sports teams are planning real estate developments next to their sporting venues (DCA).

Cleveland Cavaliers–Dan Gilbert

Earlier this week NEOtrans reported on news that Detroit-based Bedrock Real Estate has a purchase agreement to acquire Sherwin-Williams’ (SHW) soon-to-be-vacated Breen Technology Center 601 Canal Rd. Bedrock was founded by Dan Gilbert majority owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team. It plays at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse a 1994-built arena across Ontario Street from the Cuyahoga River valley.

SHW is relocating its research and development activities to suburban Brecksville at the end of 2024. Sources familiar with the pending transaction say Bedrock would demolish the research facilities and further open up land along the Cuyahoga River to achieve its portion of the city of Cleveland’s Vision for the Valley.

Bedrock’s pending purchase of 9 acres of SHW-owned land would add to the real estate firm’s 20 acres of riverfront land used primarily as surface parking lots. This is the closest riverfront to downtown’s Public Square and to the Cavs’ arena yet is largely undeveloped. Gilbert wants to change that and has changed Bedrock’s leadership to help make it happen. He hired Bedrock CEO Kofi Bonner plus Christopher Noble senior vice president of commercial real estate development and Deb Janik senior vice president of business development.

For a Detroit company the Cleveland connections are ubiquitous. Bonner is a former Cleveland Browns executive. Noble is a former chief of development at two Cleveland-based firms — Forest City Enterprises previous owners of Tower City Center and Stark Enterprises which is reportedly selling its nuCLEus properties in the Gateway District to Bedrock. Prior to January Janik worked for 17 years as senior vice president business growth and development services at the Greater Cleveland Partnership.

While Cleveland’s other sports teams appear to be investing in real estate to support new or renovated sports venues the Cavs’ owner isn’t — at least not in the near term. Gilbert interest in real estate shouldn’t be a surprise. It’s nothing new — he practically owns half of downtown Detroit. In fact his primary source of wealth has been in mortgage companies including Quicken Loans the nation’s largest mortgage lender. His internet-based Rocket Mortgage is growing fast and has a significant office presence in downtown Cleveland; its lease at the Higbee Building is due to run out Dec. 31 2026.

To construct the riverfront vision will require significant construction and modification of infrastructure including new streets sewers public plazas and new or strengthened bulkheads along the edges of the Cuyahoga River (Bedrock).

With more than 1400 jobs locally look for Rocket Mortgage to be a major tenant in whatever and wherever Bedrock builds. Law firm Benesch was also considered. Now that Benesch is moving to Key Tower look for Bedrock to zero in on another growing office tenants and headquarters to add to its downtown tenant mix.

A potential candidate may be steelmaker-shipping giant Cleveland-Cliffs which has a longstanding partnership with Gilbert’s Cavs that only grew more visible in the past week. Cliffs has been rumored to be in the market for a new HQ site despite investing in improved offices for its CEO Lourenco Goncalves at 200 Public Square.

Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse underwent $185 million in renovations in 2019. It should be in good shape for a while but could use further renovations or a possible replacement in another decade or two which is the approximate timeline that Bedrock sketched out for achieving its grand riverfront development vision last fall.

But real estate industry sources are giving mixed messages on whether that’s truly the case. Some say Bedrock’s plans for realizing its riverfront dreams could be achieved sooner. They point to Bedrock’s pending deal with Sherwin-Williams for the Breen property its creation of a new real estate entity called Huron Holdings to which the Tower City parking lot between Huron and Canal roads was transferred last December and its reported plans to rebuild its parking garage below Tower City Center.

But Gilbert is facing an 18-month timeline (from November 2021) just to determine infrastructure costs and to finalize a development agreement with the city. It will be years more before streets and riverside infrastructure can be altered. That’s why others say Gilbert’s first new-construction investment will instead occur up the hill in the heart of the Gateway District on 2.85 acres of land currently owned by Stark Enterprises. Several sources say Bedrock is buying that land a claim denied by Ezra Stark chief operating officer of Stark Enterprises.

Map of several potential development sites that are discussed in the article including the Bedrock riverfront properties the Bedrock Gateway site and the Guardians’ potential ballpark village site (KJP/MyPlaceCuyahoga).

In December Stark directed its law firm Thompson Hine LLP to get certificates of disclosure from the city’s building and housing department for all of its Gateway properties that have structures on them. Stark said the certificates had nothing to do with a pending sale. Normally certificates of disclosure are secured as part of research into properties that are subject to a sale and transfer to a new owner.

When asked about the accuracy of reports that Bedrock was seeking to buy the Stark properties Lora Brand at Bedrock’s PR firm Falls & Co. gave the same answer she gave to NEOtrans when asked about the pending sale of the Breen Technology Center to Bedrock. “If Bedrock has any news on any developments to share we will let you know” she said.

NEOtrans also received information that CBRE was hired to handle Bedrock’s commercial leasing for its Cleveland developments. When NEOtrans sent an e-mail to Keith Brandt managing director of CBRE’s Cleveland office to confirm or deny the accuracy of that information he immediately opened the e-mail but did not answer it.

One year ago sources said Bedrock extended an agreement to retain Cleveland architectural firm Vocon to conduct programming for a new mixed-use development. Bedrock also hired design and engineering firm IBI Group of Toronto to provide construction and engineering services but limited the work to geotechnical and environmental analyses of Bedrock’s riverfront properties. IBI Group staff was to start collecting soil samples from Bedrock’s riverfront properties next to Tower City Center a year ago but that work never happened sources said.

While the information is confusing and contradictory as to where Bedrock will strike first with its first new-construction development in downtown Cleveland there is one thing that the sources agree on — it will be big. Some say it will be as big as Bedrock’s Hudson’s Site in downtown Detroit. That’s a $1 billion 1.4-million-square-foot development whose tower will peak at 48 stories and 685 feet when construction is done next year. Like Detroit’s Cleveland’s will reportedly mix retail parking housing hotel and office uses in the same structure.

Equally intriguing is that Gilbert’s real estate dreams for Cleveland are reportedly being pursued in coordination with the Cavs’ neighbors in the Gateway Sports and Entertainment complex. Why? Because they pretty much have to.

Looking north from Interstate 90 with Ontario Street at the left Progressive Field dominates the foreground with several conceptual unofficial new towers shown in bluish-gray that could be built by Bedrock and HBSE (Ian McDaniel).

Cleveland Guardians–HBSE

Yes the Dolan Family led here by Paul Dolan is the current majority owner of the Cleveland Guardians nee Indians. But that’s probably not going to be the case in a few years. According to published reports David Blitzer and Josh Harris are near to acquiring for about $400 million a 35 percent ownership stake in the Guardians that would also put them on a path to acquire a majority stake from the Dolans in 2026.

Blitzer and Harris are a couple of East Coast billionaires who are partners in Harris-Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE). Multiple sources close to Gilbert’s Bedrock Real Estate and to HBSE say the two groups are coordinating their efforts to deliver a mixed-use complex that activates on a year-round-basis more economic benefits from the sport facilities.

Why does HBSE want to get involved in real estate in Cleveland? For two reasons — that’s what they do in cities where they have majority ownership stakes in sports teams — Philadelphia 76ers basketball the New Jersey Devils hockey plus their minor league teams the Delaware Blue Coats basketball and the Binghamton Devils hockey. Second Major League Baseball is encourage team owners to create ballpark villages around stadiums to diversify revenue sources and provide value-capture financing for stadium improvements and replacements.

A significant attraction to HBSE is the recently approved $435 million renovation package for Progressive Field and a 15-year lease extension for the Guardians that started Jan. 1. There are also two five-year extensions. The city and county agreed to financially support Progressive Field’s renovations and the Gateway Economic Development Corp. of Greater Cleveland extended the Guardians’ lease. Another element in the lease agreement proved attractive as well.

Although set beyond the outfield bleachers at St. Louis’ Busch Stadium the new ballpark village is a year-round destination and includes a high-rise apartment building with every amenity a baseball fan could dream of (OneCardinalWay).

Per that agreement for the next two years the city of Cleveland will make the Gateway East Garage 650 Huron Rd. and its 3.3 acres of land available for the Guardians to purchase for $25 million. In the event the team purchases the Gateway East Garage the city will use the sale proceeds to fund the city’s annual $2 million commitment towards the Public’s Ballpark Contributions and shall assign future naming rights sale proceeds to the team.

Furthermore the lease extension agreement says Gateway agrees to convey or cause to be conveyed the half-acre Gateway Development Parcel at East 9th Street and Bolivar Road to the team in exchange for a $2 million purchase price. Gateway or its transferee will then convey its entire share of the sale proceeds into the Ballpark Improvement Fund.

Combined a 3.8-acre plot of land in the heart of a major-city downtown and next to major-league sports facilities is a large canvas for future development. Demolishing some or all of the 1650-space Gateway East Garage means another parking garage will have to take up the slack for it during demolition and construction of a ballpark village that may or may not include a redesigned parking garage as part of it.

That’s where the partnership with Bedrock would come into play. Sources say construction of a large parking garage will be part of whatever Bedrock has in mind for its Gateway and/or riverfront developments. The added parking would support not only Bedrock’s developments but also a proposed ballpark village and the sporting and entertainment events at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse and Progressive Field.

What might the ballpark village look like? Sources pointed to St. Louis and its ballpark village for a possible glimpse. It features year-round food and entertainment venues hotel and a high-rise apartment building. All of those things could be accommodated on the 3.8-acre plot of land to the north of Progressive Field.

A key to developing the lakefront is to create more seamless pedestrian linkages between downtown and the water’s edge. That means constructing this $230 million land bridge that descends gently from the downtown malls over the railroad tracks and lands next to North Coast Harbor. But since the Shoreway is elevated and rising to the west here the highway is in the way of this progress (AoDK).

Cleveland Browns–Haslam family

For the first time the owners of the Cleveland Browns are starting to talk openly about a new stadium for the football team and possibly for other large events such as concerts professional soccer games and more. And like their basketball and baseball counterparts having new large steady revenue streams coming in from developed lakefront real estate to retire bonds would be preferable to what Buffalo just did in asking the public to pay $850 million for its new $1.4 billion football stadium.

Cleveland has a football-only stadium on its underutilized lakefront because when Art Modell took his football team to Baltimore in 1995 Cleveland Mayor Mike White said he wanted a new Browns team playing before the end of the century. That meant there was only place where a modern football stadium could be built so quickly — where the old municipal stadium stood. All of the water and sewer infrastructure for a 70000-plus-seat stadium was already there.

The new stadium opened in time for the Browns to return to the field in 1999. But not everyone was happy. Many civic leaders from Mayor White’s Planning Director Hunter Morrison to Gateway Sports and Entertainment Corp. Executive Director Tom Chema during the arena’s and ballpark’s early-1990s construction were disappointed that such a large lightly used football stadium was returned to the lakefront to take up so much space.

For the Browns their stadium lease with the city will expire at the end of 2028. By then the stadium will be 30 years old and one of the oldest in the National Football League. That alone isn’t a reason to replace it even though FirstEnergy Stadium does need more than a new coat of paint since its $120 million update in 2014.

Whether the Haslams and Greater Cleveland can afford a new football stadium will depend on many things. One of those things is the fate of the Shoreway highway past the existing lakefront stadium. The reason is that a proposed land bridge over the railroad tracks to connect downtown and the lakefront needs the elevated Shoreway removed or lowered.

This design alternative called Concept D proposes constructing a landbridge across the railroad tracks removing the Shoreway downtown constructing a port access road combining Amtrak and light-rail services in a new station building a new boulevard and extending East 18th Street north to the new boulevard to ease traffic and develop the Campus District (Osborne).

A study now underway by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to determine traffic impacts from several options of redesigning the Shoreway or replacing it with a boulevard through downtown will determine whether funding from ODOT and the Federal Highway Administration can be used and if so which pots of money.

If traffic is slowed down through downtown traditional ODOT and federal dollars can’t be used. However there are new pots of ODOT and federal funds for transportation projects whose goals aren’t for putting more cars through cities at higher speeds. They include ODOT’s Jobs & Commerce Economic Development (JCED) program and the new federal Reconnecting Communities pilot program (Sec. 11509) for removing highways and viaducts that divide cities.

If the Shoreway isn’t removed the lakefront will remain severed from downtown and a less extensive redevelopment of the downtown lakefront will only be possible. Under that scenario a limited amount of revenues from a lakefront development can be generated for the football stadium. That means the lakefront stadium will probably remain where it is albeit renovated.

But if the Shoreway is replaced with a boulevard it could allow the restoration of a street grid and pedestrian connections across buried railroad and transit tracks creating a unified downtown community from the central business district to the water’s edge. More residents workers offices shops and recreation can be added. Under that scenario more lease and tax revenues could be generated to afford removing the existing football stadium and building a new one someplace else.

Two relocation options appear under consideration according to real estate industry sources. One is the Plan B site from the 1990s that was widely favored by almost everyone except the mayor — the former intermodal rail yards. Located on the other side of Interstate 90 from the Gateway complex the site would be easily accessible by highways and all rapid transit lines which share the same tracks below the site. The property is owned by ODOT thus potentially reducing site acquisition costs. The transaction could even be used as ODOT’s share of converting the Shoreway into a boulevard.

The former intermodal yards site on the south side of Interstate 90 from Progressive Field (top-center) could accommodate a football facility the size of FirstEnergy Stadium with room left over for a plaza (shown in green) two parking decks (in black) and a rapid transit station (in red) near downtown Cleveland (KJP/Google).

But the site is constrained from offering much spin-off development. The nearest potential development area is the Flats South District but is mostly on the other side of I-90. Another possibility might be the redevelopment of some or all of the 35-acre main post office property which doesn’t need as much space as it once did. But considering how seldom a football stadium is used perhaps spin-off development isn’t as important unless it can be it own attraction as is the Patriot Place lifestyle center in Foxborough MA.

The other site alternative reportedly in the conversation is the northeast side of downtown north of St. Clair Avenue and in the East 20s. While this would give the Haslams the ability to develop around a new football stadium and expand downtown along Davenport Bluffs there are more than 100 small properties that would have to be acquired.

The site would be accessible from I-90 a proposed new East 18th Street extension to/from the Shoreway and bolster the Campus District’s call for extending the light-rail Waterfront Line as a loop via the east side of downtown to also serve Cleveland State University Tri-C Metro and the growing St. Vincent Hospital. But absent land use regulations and an emphasis on use of the existing Muny Parking lots along the Shoreway it also risks turning the area between downtown and Asiatown into a sea of surface parking lots. Of course that assumes the Browns go the new-stadium route.

“The city and the (Greater) Cleveland Partnership have taken over the waterfront development piece and we have committees working on that” said Dee Haslam in a written statement. “Our part now is how we bring the stadium up to a better standard so I think we’ve started interviewing and thinking about architects and consultants. We’re kind of in that very beginning stage and can start having those conversations and hopefully marry it with the work that the city and partnerships are doing on the waterfront development.”

Developing next to Cleveland’s sporting venues is ultimately about leveraging the attraction and value of those amenities to create new places where people want to enjoy a dynamic urban quality of life (Bialosky).

Timing

While the All-Star Game in Cleveland in mid-February seemed like an opportune occasion for Gilbert to announce his big surprise it was not to be. The last of the certificates of disclosure were gathered for the Gateway properties only one month earlier. When Sherwin-Williams gathered the certificates for its new headquarters west of Public Square three more months passed before it made its HQ site selection official.

It often takes a year for the buyer of a major property acquisition to go through its due diligence including geotechnical analysis. However Stark already gathered geotechnical data for the Gateway properties prior to making construction-ready plans for the shorter nuCLEus. Bedrock was about to conduct similar core drilling for the riverfront properties but told its geotech firm to stand down in April 2021. If a purchase agreement for Stark’s properties was the reason then one would think an announcement from Bedrock is coming soon.

The Guardians’ plans would follow Bedrock’s if for no other reason that a major new parking facility will need to be provided first before the Guardians acquire from the city the Gateway East Garage for possible demolition. Purchasing the parking garage and the development parcel at East 9th and Bolivar would need to occur sometime in the next two years per the new lease with Gateway. The garage’s partial or full demolition would follow to create a ballpark village development site.

The Browns’ decision making depends on the outcome of a federally compliant project development process for redesigning or downgrading the Shoreway as a boulevard. Some answers from that process should come by the end of this year when a locally preferred alternative for a transportation investment is chosen. The Browns will be in a position to decide whether it may pursue a stadium renovation or a new stadium — and where.

Then detailed design and engineering of the transportation improvements for the chosen alternative will be carried out in the following two years along with funding procurement. Assuming all of the construction funding for the Shoreway redesign/removal can be found in a timely manner shovels could start turning dirt for it as early as 2026 — three years before the Browns’ stadium lease runs out.

With the xScreen a new clip-on monitor for the Xbox Series S Microsoft's smaller system is now able to travel with you.

The $250 xScreen from Upspec Gaming is a small monitor that connects to an Xbox Series S and makes the console experience extremely portable. The Series S is a fantastic current-gen console and even though it isn't as powerful as the Xbox Series X or the PlayStation 5 the lower price and small size make it a really good value as a way to get into the current generation of console gaming. The xScreen capitalizes on that small size to make your console more travel-friendly.

The xScreen is an 11.6-inch screen with 1920x1080-pixel resolution at 60Hz. The screen does not support HDR which would be too great a power draw for a small portable device. But it's that tiny footprint that allows the xScreen to sit flush against the Series S when folded down like a clamshell laptop to remain as compact as possible. It attaches right to the back of the Series S and pulls its power from the console so the only cable you'll need is the Xbox's power cord.

Upspec also offers a few additional accessories for customizing and transporting your gaming setup. First is the xScreen Case which holds not only the monitor but also the attached Xbox console and a controller and has additional room for cables or other small accessories. The case costs $60.

You can also get the xScreen Stand Feet which are little plastic pieces that allow the Series S to stand on its side with the screen pointed directly up above it. These sell for $25.

Finally you can get additional colored latches. These are used to fasten the monitor to the console by use of the Xbox's vents and they hold everything in place. Purchasing the xScreen by itself will include white latches so these are just a fun add-on if you want some color. The colored latches cost $10.

The xScreen attaches to the back of the device. It plugs into the power slot and uses up one USB port. Don't worry the Series S still has a USB port on the front and the expansion slot on the back is still accessible if you want to plug in one of Microsoft's proprietary hard drives. One downside however is that the xScreen does prevent the ethernet port from being used. This means you're stuck using Wi-Fi for any downloads or online gaming.

You're most likely to position the Series S flat on a table when using it but the Stand Feet allow the console to sit on its front face. You can then rotate the screen all the way pointing up. The console feels sturdy enough when doing this and there's no disc drive to worry about being blocked. It's not really clear why you would want to position your Xbox like this instead of laying it flat -- maybe you have a really cluttered desk or something? But either way more options are better.

Sean Booker/CNET

On its own the Series S weighs 4.25 pounds (1.93kg) and with the xScreen attached it's a total weight of 5.7 pounds. If you get the carrying case and fill it with everything you'll need for gaming including a controller it's up to 8.5 pounds. That's still a pound lighter than the Xbox Series X is by itself. The screen adds an additional 1.5 inches of depth.

In hands-on use the xScreen looked great. Games like Tunic Elden Ring and Apex Legends felt good the whole time during testing. The setup is easy it's just plug and play. Being able to throw it into a backpack and carry around a full-blown console and screen is awesome. It's comfortably usable at a desk in the office on a coffee table in the living room or even while in bed. Upspec Gaming's website even shows some of the developers using this on a plane ride. Not the easiest situation to test out but something I look forward to trying. I did manage to get it to work by plugging the entire setup into a car's power port.

The xScreen also features built-in speakers. You can control the game volume as well as the screen's brightness by using physical buttons on top. It also has a power button and a menu button to access the panel's color features. The last button will overlay a crosshair in the middle of the screen sometimes used to alleviate motion sickness with several different crosshair options to choose from.

Sean Booker/CNET

The possibilities for the xScreen are really exciting. This device is great if you're someone who travels a lot for work or a student living in a cramped dorm room. With how easy it is to just close and slip into a bag it enters the conversation where only my Nintendo Switch was previously an option. As a kid who grew up moving back and forth between my parents' houses lugging around game consoles and a TV each way was required. I still pack a Series X with me whenever I fly back to my hometown to visit my folks. Not anymore. For me the xScreen is a game-changer.

Let's talk about the one drawback I ran into: the screen size. You're definitely trading screen real estate for portability. An 11.6-inch screen is tiny like a cheap Chromebook and you're probably going to have to sit pretty close to it. I found that anything that involved quick timing required sitting 2 to 3 feet away from the screen. This also means that text shows up pretty small and might require leaning in even closer to make out all the details. Hopefully whatever game you're playing has accessibility features that include increasing the text size.

Sean Booker/CNET

Another thing to watch out for is the amount of heat coming out of the Series S' top vent. When the console is on and even for some time after shutting down the Xbox vents a lot of heat from this top circular grate. Upspec points out that you shouldn't close the monitor while the console is on to avoid overheating. However even when you shut it down first and then close the panel the Xbox still produces a lot of heat for a while while turned off. I recommend shutting down the machine a few minutes before closing the lid.

An Xbox Series S costs $300 but is often discounted to close to around $250. The xScreen by itself is $250. So that doubles the price of the console and that's not including the case or any of the other accessories.

When compared with a stand-alone TV or monitor the xScreen is also on the expensive side. A decent 40-inch TV is around $250 -- but a 40-inch TV would be way harder to transport.

Even if you don't move around much the xScreen is still a very cool and very premium accessory to have. Although the Series S lacks the performance and power of the Series X this accessory makes traveling a lot easier. If you're someone who likes bringing game consoles on the road I recommend it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvNTA0MzMxOC9wcmVnbmFudC1sZW9uYS1sZXdpcy1zbmFwLWJhYnktYnVtcC1kcmVzcy1iaXJ0aGRheS_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LzUwNDMzMTgvcHJlZ25hbnQtbGVvbmEtbGV3aXMtc25hcC1iYWJ5LWJ1bXAtZHJlc3MtYmlydGhkYXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pregnant Leona Lewis shares rare snap of her baby bump in plunging blue dress...,"BLEEDING LOVELY Pregnant Leona Lewis shares rare snap of her baby bump in plunging blue dress

Her birthday celebrations come after Leona revealed she was 'unable to leave the house' due to being 'severely ill' during her 'challenging' first trimester.

It comes weeks after the star confirmed she was expecting her first child with husband Dennis Jauch.

Sources revealed that the Bleeding Love hitmaker – who married the creative director in 2019 – is due to give birth later this year.

A source said: “Leona and Dennis are absolutely over the moon. They have passed the 12-week milestone and told their family and friends at the beginning of the year.

“They can’t wait to welcome their arrival and to be a family of three.”

Leona – who shot to fame when she won the X Factor in 2006 – saw her career go from strength to strength after debut Spirit became one of the best-selling albums in chart history.

She has sold more than 35million records worldwide with five successful albums and nominations for seven Brit Awards and three Grammy Awards.

She first met long-term love Dennis when he worked as a dancer on her 2010 Labyrinth tour and they began dating soon after.

In November 2018 Leona confirmed they were engaged after being pictured wearing a diamond ring while on holiday writing in an Instagram post: “I can’t wait to be your wife.

The pair married in a lavish ceremony at Sting’s 16th-century luxury estate in Tuscany a year later.

And in 2020 Leona spoke about the pair’s plans to have a family – revealing that they would consider adopting as her mum Maria grew up in care.

Speaking in a magazine interview Leona said: “I do want children but Dennis and I have also talked about adopting.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB1cmV3b3cuY29tL25ld3MvcXVlZW4tZWxpemFiZXRoLXByaW5jZS1waGlsaXAtam9obi1qYWNraWUta2VubmVkeS10aHJvd2JhY2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Royal Family Just Shared a Vintage Snap of Queen Elizabeth & Prince Philip with John & Jackie Kennedy,"To celebrate Queen Elizabeth's upcoming Platinum Jubilee the royal family has been sharing all kinds of rare throwbacks to Instagram.

Emeli Sandé posts first snap with girlfriend after taking 'time to accept' herself

Emeli Sandé has shared an adorable snap of herself and her new partner after revealing she had found love with a woman earlier this week.

The Next To Me singer 35 thanked fans for their ""acceptance and kind wishes"" as she shared the first public picture of her ""soul mate Yoana"".

Emeli explained on Saturday how finding love with her girlfriend had given her strength and she now feels ""happier than ever"".

The Scottish star - who was previously married to marine biologist Adam Gouraguine - shared the news of her relationship status in a new interview ahead of her new album release for Let's Say For Instance in May.

Writing to her 404000 Instagram followers on Saturday the BRIT Award winner claimed it felt like a ""huge weight"" had been lifted after sharing some of her personal life with the public.

Captioning a cute picture of herself beaming alongside Yoana Emeli wrote: "" It’s taken me many years to find the strength to be myself. I’ve struggled for a long time to accept myself as I am.

""I’m so lucky to have found my soul mate Yoana she’s such an extraordinary woman! Falling in love with her gave me the strength I needed! Feels so good to be in love and I feel happier than ever.""

The talented vocalist added: ""I’m deeply touched by all your messages of love and support. Thank you so much for your acceptance and kind wishes. Feels like a huge weight has been lifted here’s to a new beginning in truth and happiness!""

Former Radio One DJ Annie Mac was one of the first to comment on the emotional post telling the star: ""Oh Emeli! What a beautiful revelation - wishing you and Yoana all the happiness together xx.""

Newly-engaged Nick Grimshaw added ""Beautiful. Congratulations"" while Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland gushed: ""I AM BEYOND HAPPY FOR YOU!! Congratulations!!!!!!""

On Thursday it was announced that Emeli met and fell in love with classical pianist Yoana when she was learning about classical music.

As her previous public relationships have been with men the singer-songwriter was asked if she now feels comfortable with the label bisexual.

""I’m not sure what I identify as but I guess so. I just feel like I should fall in love with whoever I fall in love with"" she explained to The Metro.

Emeli was previously married to her childhood sweetheart Adam but announced they had parted ways in 2014 - just two years after they tied the knot in September 2012.

The University of Glasgow graduate has previously opened up about hard the split was - admitting to feeling like she had lost her best friend.

""I think I spent the couple of months after not in denial but not really dealing with what had happened"" Emeli recalled when discussing her divorce with The Times.

""Adam and I had been together since I was 17. He was my only boyfriend. That's the only person I've been with for the past 10 years.

She added: ""So [losing] our relationship more than the marriage was the big part for me to deal with.

""Having a friend who'd been my best friend for so long ... losing that support and structure in my life was the biggest thing.""

Their three-year contract which covers workers at 540 stores expired on March 6 and on March 27 the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) announced that a strike authorization vote across the seven locals covered under the contract had returned 95 percent of ballots cast in favor of authorizing an unfair labor practice strike. The UFCW has filed claims with the National Labor Relations Board alleging employer intimidation harassment surveillance and illegally influencing workers during negotiations accusations that the companies deny.

The stores are Albertsons Vons Pavilions and Ralphs comprising two of the country’s largest supermarket chains — Albertsons owns Vons and Pavilion while Kroger owns Ralphs. Bargaining has been ongoing since late January with the two sides meeting today but workers are now prepared to walk out if need be. Should they walk off the job it would be the largest strike since the pre-pandemic teachers’ strikes and the largest private-sector strike since seventy-four thousand UAW members struck General Motors in 2007.

“Bargaining committees composed of front-line grocery workers and union leaders came prepared with proposals that would fairly increase wages and improve store conditions to reflect the needs of workers in a pandemic and post-pandemic world” the UFCW said in a statement earlier this month. “The corporations representing the stores offered pennies a proposal that would ultimately be a pay cut due to inflation.”

Wages are a key point of disagreement. The union is pushing for significant wage increases for workers who have kept the stores running through two years of the pandemic but it says the employers have only offered a 60-cent-per-year hourly increase amounting to a $1.80-an-hour raise by the end of the contract.

As the Los Angeles Times reports the union is seeking a $5 hourly raise by the end of the new contract for the highest-paid senior workers — food clerks which include cashiers and shelf stockers who comprise around one-third of the workforce and currently make $22.50 an hour after five to seven years at the job. The union seeks to raise wages by $8 an hour by the end of the contract for general merchandising clerks who currently make a maximum of $17.02 an hour arguing that they do comparable work to the higher-paid employees. For these workers the companies have offered a $2-an-hour raise. It is unclear how much the companies will offer for baggers and clerk’s helpers the lowest-paid third of the workforce who currently make just above California’s $15-an-hour minimum wage.

Sufficient staffing and more predictable scheduling are other worker priorities as are health and safety — grocery store staff have been hit particularly hard by COVID-19 with an estimated 7709 Local 770 members contracting the illness and a mass shooting in 2021 at a Kroger-owned King Soopers in Colorado has made safety committees a demand as well. The companies have thus far rejected proposals concerning worker safety and minimum staffing guarantees.

“These companies can either come to the table ready to negotiate a fair deal or we’re going to have to take this fight elsewhere” Kathy Finn secretary-treasurer of UFCW Local 770 in Los Angeles and a lead negotiator told the Los Angeles Times. A strike was also authorized in 2019 during the previous round of contract negotiations but the two sides reached an agreement without a work stoppage.

Ralphs has responded to the strike threat by attempting to hire temporary workers vowing to remain open should workers walk off the job. One TikTok user created a script to flood the company’s hiring portal with fake job applications — he told the Los Angeles Times that twenty-five thousand such submissions went through and the page no longer appears to be active. “It’s disappointing that these failed attempts were aimed at disrupting [a community’s] access to fresh food and essential items” a Ralphs representative told the paper.

The fight comes at a time when tensions between grocery-store workers and their employers are particularly heightened. Pandemic-era rhetoric casting cashiers as “essential” plays a role in leading workers to fight back for dignity they feel they are denied on the job and eight thousand UFCW Local 7 members who work at Kroger-owned stores in Colorado just went on strike earlier this year.

Also relevant is a recent report detailing the sorry state of Kroger’s massive workforce. The country’s fourth-largest private employer Kroger offers such poor wages and benefits that 14 percent of the Kroger employees surveyed for the report have been homeless in the past year 36 percent worry about eviction and more than three-quarters meet the US Department of Agriculture’s definition of “food insecure.” The findings are based on a survey of more than ten thousand of the company’s employees some of them the very workers in Southern California who are preparing to strike.

Even as Kroger’s profits skyrocket — its operating profits nearly doubled between 2019 and 2021 — the company has been particularly unwilling to offer additional pay to the people who staff its stores. When Los Angeles and Long Beach passed ordinances mandating hazard pay for grocery-store workers the company closed five locations. It claimed these stores were financially unsustainable but the action had all the markings of a capital strike — an employer preferring to shutter locations entirely rather than hike worker pay. Meanwhile Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen made $22.4 million in 2020.

“Rodney McMullen can afford helicopters and yachts and I will be homeless when my parents die” wrote one King Soopers clerk in the recent survey of Kroger workers. Or as one Vons employee told the Los Angeles Times “We know they’ve made billions in profits and we’re not afraid to go out. There’s a big change coming.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2xvc2FuZ2VsZXMvbmV3cy9zb3V0aGVybi1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWdyb2Nlcnktd29ya2Vycy1wcmVwYXJlLWZvci1hLXN0cmlrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southern California grocery workers prepare for a strike,"Southland grocery workers are preparing for a strike.

Last week members authorized a strike only if they cannot reach a contract agreement but talks will continue until Tuesday when the union will decide on its next steps.

On Saturday with community help union workers gathered at UFCW 77 headquarters near Koreatown to make signs for a potential picket line.

The union represents 40000 Vons Ralphs and Albertsons workers. Their contract expired March 6th.

""Right now I feel like the company is not really respecting us after we over a million had a strike vote"" Marco Escalante a worker said. ""At this moment it seems like their bargaining is not in touch with what we need and the fair wages that we're asking for and everything that basically we're asking for on the table.""

Workers want a $5 an hour raise but say they were offered 60 cents instead.

Earlier Ralphs released a statement that says in part:

""Our three goals throughout negotiations are to reward and invest in our people keep groceries affordable for our customers and maintain a sustainable business that create jobs in the future. The current UFCW proposal only meets one of those goals. We encourage the UFCW to join us in meaningful and balanced negotiations to promptly deliver wage increases to our associates.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS93b3JsZC9leHBsYWluZWQtYWxsLXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtbmV3bHktbmFtZXMtc291dGhlcm4tb2NlYW4vYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODM2Mjc5OTIuY21z0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2V4cGxhaW5lZC1hbGwteW91LW5lZWQtdG8ta25vdy1hYm91dC1uZXdseS1uYW1lcy1zb3V0aGVybi1vY2Vhbi9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODM2Mjc5OTIuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explained: All you need to know about newly named Southern Ocean,"Explainer TIMESOFINDIA.COM Updated: Apr 3 2022 18:20 IST IST

Actually all the four ocean names that you know are part of one global ocean. But now the National Geographic Society has demarcated a fifth ocean — Southern Ocean

Here’s a trick question: How many oceans are there in the world? Actually there is just one global ocean encompassing 71% of the planet that till recently has been geographically divided into four oceans namely Pacific Atlantic Indian and Arctic. On June 8 the National Geographic Society  after a century of mapping oceans added a fifth name to the list — Southern Ocean . Previously also called Antarctic Ocean informally this body of water encircling the coldest continent has long been recognised by scientists but due to a lack of international consensus it was never officially acknowledged.

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) the governing body for the naming of bodies of water around the world included the Southern Ocean for the first time in 2000. It defined the limits of this ocean as the waters below 60° south latitude which is the common limit with the South Atlantic Ocean the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean right till the coast of Antarctica  including the Antarctic Peninsula. Two years later the IHO came out with a final draft for the fourth edition of its S-23 publication “Names and Limits of Oceans and Seas” with this classification but lists “reservation by Australia'' for the same. Although experts say that the fourth edition is unlikely to come out anytime soon due to intractable differences over sea names many nations and organisations have long accepted this de facto definition of the Southern Ocean.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL2dhemV0dGUuY29tL3ByZW1pdW0vMjAtY3VyaW9zaXRpZXMtYWxvbmctaW50ZXJzdGF0ZS0yNS1pbi1jb2xvcmFkby1mcm9tLWFuY2llbnQtY29uZS10by1iYXRtYW4tYnVpbGRpbmctdG8tbmF0dXJhbC9hcnRpY2xlX2JjMjA3YjBhLWEwOTEtMTFlYy1hM2JmLTA3MDU1YTU3Nzk1My5odG1s0gGwAWh0dHBzOi8vZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vcHJlbWl1bS8yMC1jdXJpb3NpdGllcy1hbG9uZy1pbnRlcnN0YXRlLTI1LWluLWNvbG9yYWRvLWZyb20tYW5jaWVudC1jb25lLXRvLWJhdG1hbi1idWlsZGluZy10by1uYXR1cmFsL2FydGljbGVfYmMyMDdiMGEtYTA5MS0xMWVjLWEzYmYtMDcwNTVhNTc3OTUzLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,20 curiosities along Interstate 25 in Colorado — from ancient cone to 'Batman building' to Natural Fort,"Coming from New Mexico or Wyoming Interstate 25 travelers into Colorado are greeted by that familiar sign. “Welcome to Colorful Colorado.”

Travel the extent of that interstate running through the Front Range and it’s easy to understand the moniker.

From Fishers Peak in Trinidad to Greenhorn Mountain closer to Pueblo to Castle Rock and the 14000-foot likes of Pikes Peak and Longs Peak in between the natural beauty catches the eye. As do curiosities closer to the pavement.

Whether you’re visitor or resident you’ve likely wondered about some of these. We’re here with the answers.

We’ll start our drive south and work our way up:

Art Cartopia Museum

Just outside downtown Trinidad you might spot the shed with colorful lettering and even more colorful contents. This is home to the strange local breed of motorheads: those with a whimsical touch. They call themselves “cartists” transforming vehicles into fantastical carriages — or full-on robots or dragons. More than 25 have been on display at the museum.

Ludlow

North of Trinidad an exit marks a site of dark history. In the ghost town of Ludlow a monument stands in remembrance of a massacre.

On April 20 1914 the Colorado National Guard clashed with striking coal miners of a tent camp. It’s believed more than two dozen perished including 11 children and two women. They died in an underground cellar eerily preserved as part of the memorial.

Huerfano Butte

Huerfano is Spanish for orphan. “So Huerfano is an orphan that sits out here as the world goes by” we heard a geologist say about this 300-foot mound of ancient rubble. Sitting on private property between Walsenburg and Colorado City it looks like a miniature volcano. The cone came into shape over millions of years rising through the ashes of an age of violent eruptions.

Gallery at 64

That’s what Ray Shaw has called his vibrant space so named for the exit number that leads to the otherwise nondescript block of a building. Inside once we admired paintings by a man with a lifelong interest in art and wildlife.

Graneros Gorge

Maybe you’ve seen the name on the exit near Colorado City and thought it must be mistaken. Surely there’s no such gorge on those blank plains to the east. But indeed where you least expect it on a country road the earth breaks for rugged cliffs and the best view you’ve never heard about. Though on public land Graneros Gorge has been largely neglected.

EVRAZ Pueblo

You can’t drive through the steel city without driving through the heart of the historic industry. Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. established the mill in the 1880s. Parts of the plant are operated now by Chicago-based EVRAZ North America churning out rail pipe and rod shipped beyond southern Colorado.

Pikes Peak International Raceway

The grandstands you see today have been reduced tens of thousands of seats over the years. The glory days of pros zipping around the oval are long gone. But the track south of Fountain has managed to survive since its late-’90s beginnings. The raceway operates year-round with amateurs testing their limits.

Al Kaly Shrine Mule Train

In Colorado Springs not far from The Broadmoor World Arena a much different venue turns heads on the other side of the interstate. An old dairy farm maintains its silo and barn oddly topped by a mule statue.

Also there’s a clubhouse with trophies and photos going back decades. This is where a local club keeps its 65-year history of riding mules in parades and performing in drills nationwide. The mule train is thought to be the last of its kind within Shriners International the Masonic society found in 1870.

Greenland Open Space

Between Monument and Larkspur between the buttes and mesas that go underappreciated in the traffic rush a nostalgic spread appears frozen in time. A dirt road stretches to a trailhead passing farm animals and old structures including a schoolhouse. A picnic pavilion now honors the old general store in what was an important shipping center along the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad.

It’s all land and sky beyond inspiring to a poet. Having ridden the train by Helen Hunt Jackson is credited for the name Greenland.

Jellystone Park at Larkspur

Between Larkspur and Castle Rock it’s been impossible to miss the expansion of what appears to be some combination of theme park and tiny home village on the west side of the highway. This is in fact one of those Yogi Bear-themed family getaways. It calls itself an RV resort complete also with an array of modern lodging water playground sports courts a restaurant and more.

Denver Waste Management building

You aren’t the first person to wonder what that tan towering arching building is near downtown Denver close to the Sixth Avenue freeway looming over the west side of the interstate. Perhaps some extravagant religious base? A temple? “The Batman building?” That’s what someone called it on a Reddit thread in which an answer emerged:

“I wish it was something more ... exciting. But it’s the Denver Wastewater Management building. They manage poop.”

The Society of Architectural Historians refers to the bizarre headquarters as a “Neo-Art Deco daydream.” The group reports the designer drew it up “in the spirit of the 1930s Works Progress Administration.”

Turntable Studios

Here’s another head-turner to go with Mile High Stadium. Next door is this high circular multicolored retro-looking structure that yes looks as if it could be some recording palace. It is instead a trendy microapartment concept as developers explained in 2014 when they reimagined the former Hotel VQ. Units range from 330-820 square feet across the 13 floors.

The Grizzly Rose

Nothing of note for passersby who see it tucked between an industrial strip (though the red old-school saloon exterior is intriguing). But for country music lovers Grizzly Rose is a special haven — “truly one of the last great honky tonks in the world” the website reads. Live music line dancing and mechanical bull-riding have been tradition since the venue opened in 1989.

EarthRoamer

That’s the company name that catches the eye in the flyby locale of Dacono. This is the headquarters for something of a cult a deep-pocketed community of road warriors around the country. Retired couples sell their homes and opt for an EarthRoamer a beastly sleek luxurious all-terrain traveler built from top-of-the-line Ford trucks.

Johnson’s Corner

This was a roadside attraction before there was the road that is I-25. You can see grainy pictures inside from the 1950s those timeless blocky letters hanging over an empty field. Farmers of Johnstown and Milliken still gather inside as do weary truckers for a hot meal and the famous cinnamon rolls.

Swetsville Zoo

From the interstate near Timnath you can hardly spot the castle-like pillars of Bill Swets’ home under the Harmony Road bridge. His riverside property though is no secret. Swetsville Zoo is home to a bunch of quirky iron creatures that Swets spent his life molding from farm and car parts. For years they’ve been free for families to admire.

Budweiser Events Center

Everyone knows the Broncos Nuggets and Avalanche. The pro squads. But fewer know the Eagles Colorado’s American Hockey League team. They take to the ice in this sprawling glassy arena — quite the complex for little Loveland. The Budweiser Events Center is situated on the Larimer County fairgrounds.

Bee Family Centennial Farm Museum

North of Fort Collins in the farm fields east of the interstate there’s a modest home and inconspicuous set of pens and corrals and sheds. Here the unlikely story of one family’s efforts to cultivate the arid land is told. That is the Bee family who started carving out a life here in 1882. The museum tour visits several animals and pieces of machinery along with the old migrant worker house wagon barn and metal and wool shops.

National Black-Footed Ferret Conservation Center

It doesn’t look like much is happening around Carr approaching the Wyoming border. But off the road there’s an effort to restore one of North America’s rarest mammals. This is the government’s safe keep for black-footed ferrets which in 1981 were rediscovered in the next state over. The furry button-nosed beady-eyed critters look cute but they fiercely prey on the prairie dogs that also make home in this prairie.

Natural Fort

Before exiting Colorado there’s one last thing fitting for the state’s “colorful” motto. That’s this peculiar low-lying arrangement of rock outcrops and spires that lives up to the local name. Unfortunately the Natural Fort has been subject to unnatural phenomenons such as spray paint and trash.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNzdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9hcHIvMDMvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXRyYW5zcGxhbnQtaG9wZXMtdG8tbHVyZS10ZWNoLWdhbWUtY2hhbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas transplant hopes to lure tech 'game-changers' to Southern Nevada,"Las Vegas transplant hopes to lure tech ‘game-changers’ to Southern Nevada

As he stood on a villa balcony overlooking the posh Wynn Golf Club Teddy Liaw peered off in the distance.

On this near-perfect spring day on the Strip an onlooker might have mistaken the pause by Liaw an avid golfer for a brief daydream possibly a yearning to be on the course.

His clubs were in the private villa just a few steps away but Liaw had played the previous day. He wasn’t thinking about golf.

Instead the California transplant — a businessman who moved here from the Bay Area early last year — wanted to talk about a unique plan for a fall conference in Las Vegas.

Instead of a traditional conference or trade show which Las Vegas is known for hosting Liaw and a small group of entrepreneurs want to host a few dozen tech industry investors and executives for a multiday showcase of Southern Nevada in September.

The idea is to use Liaw’s access to deep-pocketed investors and tech executives in the Bay Area to get more people to follow his path to Las Vegas.

“This isn’t going to be for the masses” Liaw said. “We’re talking about a list of 50 to 100 curated people all people that have invested into billion-dollar companies founded billion-dollar companies or they themselves are billionaires.”

The goal Liaw said is to convince a percentage of those who attend to live and work in the Las Vegas Valley a place Liaw and his family have grown to love.

“This is a targeted experience to get people to see Las Vegas in a different light” Liaw said. “Everybody’s been here along the 2-3 miles that we know as the Strip but we’re going to expose people to other places. We want people to have a new perspective about living here playing golf here eating here…We want them to say ‘Wow I didn’t know that was in Vegas.’ This will be the anti-Strip conference; it’s not going to be at the Convention Center.”

Liaw has no issue with the Las Vegas convention scene — that’s part of what the area has to offer. But he’ll instead take the group to Allegiant Stadium for a tour to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area and to a party at a mansion at The Summit an exclusive community in Summerlin.

He also plans to show off a posh off-strip condo parts of Henderson someprivate schools and Tivoli Village one of Liaw’s favorite hangouts.

He said a list of confirmed attendees includes Eugene Kim one of the founders of the wildly popular Kanye West-inspired sneaker line Yeezy; Sam Yam co-founder of artist crowd-sourcing platform Patreon; and Kevin Lin one of the founders of Twitch a video streaming service that was sold to Amazon in 2014 for nearly $1 billion.

Liaw said there will only be 50 to 100 spots at the conference and that he’s sure there will eventually be a waiting list.

“This is going to be a group of founders and executives key people for some household name companies” Liaw said. “Some will be people who are huge in the VC (venture capitalist) world. This is my personal network and the network of the committee we’ve formed.”

That committee includes among others Heather Brown and Piotr Tomasik from a nonprofit called StartUp Vegas and representatives from the Global Leadership Organization a community-building nonprofit that Liaw founded in 2012. Others members are: Bernard Bermudez (Senior Vice President Enterprise Bank & Trust) Liza Fong (Co-founder Connect Realty & Associates) Rukshana Hussian (former city of Las Vegas adminstrator) Jason Lin (Founder Super Capital) and Ashley Lowe (Founder Meetings.Vegas).

Tomasik is the founder of a successful tech firm called Influential a Las Vegas startup that markets social media influencers.

Liaw when he’s not out golfing works a day job as CEO of NexRep a call center company that allows its workers to operate from home.

For much of the pandemic Liaw has worked from his rented suite at the Wynn Fairway Villas.

NexRep though it’s technically based in Maine has about 100 employees in the Las Vegas Valley.

With remote work as a built-in business model NexRep has been successful during the pandemic Liaw said.

Liaw 43 was featured in a Wall Street Journal story from April 2021 about homebuyers who were “taking a chance on Las Vegas.”

In that piece Liaw talked about the home he purchased — complete with a wine cellar three-car garage and two pools — and how he felt “safe” in Las Vegas.

Originally from Southern California Liaw graduated from the University of California Berkeley in 2001 with degrees in business administration and ethnic studies.

He raves about how much more expensive a home like his in Las Vegas costs now in the San Francisco area.

He said the Bay Area “lost energy” during the pandemic when scores of workers in many different industries across the country discovered they could work remotely from almost anywhere.

Liaw still has family in California but he noted that it’s relatively painless to fly back like he did recently to visit his mother for a couple of days.

Josh Leavitt a Las Vegas entrepreneur and the CEO of Tech Alley a network of techies who meet once per month downtown first heard of Liaw through that newspaper piece.

Leavitt a Las Vegas native said he’s intrigued by the idea of a recruiting conference that focuses on landmarks off the Strip.

“I’ve heard so many times from people who move here then discover many of the things the area has to offer like Mount Charleston or what things are like off the Strip” Leavitt said. “The bright lights are what people are attracted to and rightfully so but there’s so much more that we have to offer.”

Leavitt talked about Liaw in terms of a collaborator and visionary in some ways the same as many talked years ago about Tony Hsieh the late entrepreneur and venture capitalist who invested millions of dollars into various projects in downtown Las Vegas.

“Teddy is the type of guy who’s very energetic and personable great at bringing people together” Leavitt said. “He does something that’s fascinating — he identifies the resources that you bring to the table and he helps leverage them in a way that moves ideas forward.”

Liaw brushed off the Hsieh comparison — for one thing Liaw doesn’t have the capacity to spend the kind of money that the late billionaire had access to — but said he respects what Hsieh the former CEO of Zappos did to change the narrative in Las Vegas.

“Everything Tony did was amazing” Liaw said. “He moved here he committed to Las Vegas. Tony came to a gaming city and made it be open to technology. He did it by brute force — by putting his own money and his people into his projects. What I’m trying to do is different but because of Tony people know that tech is embraced in Las Vegas.”

Partly because of the economic downturn in the tourism industry caused by the pandemic there has been renewed interest in efforts to diversify Southern Nevada’s visitor-dependent economy.

Politicians city and local government leaders and other community leaders have talked publicly in recent months about the need for the region to diversify its economy.

The problem is that when economic conditions in the U.S. take a downward turn people have less money to spend on visits to Las Vegas. That in turn means that Southern Nevada’s economy takes a big hit.

If other sectors of the economy here were to grow — manufacturing tech and logistics are among the most talked about — it would take pressure off the tourism and hospitality sector.

That’s not a new problem for Las Vegas but people like Ryan Smith economic and urban development director for the city believe that someone with the vision of a Teddy Liaw could help greatly.

“Technology transcends all industry” Smith said. “If you create a startup ecosystem where companies can come in and scale new technologies that will definitely help diversify the economy here. That will bring new money and new innovation. Vegas will always be the entertainment and now sports capital of the world. But if Vegas is also known for innovation that will help diversify the job base here. I think people are starting to see that.”

The time for Las Vegas to capitalize on that potential is now Liaw said.

“We’re bringing legit people here” Liaw said. “It only takes one Steve Wynn to change a Las Vegas or one Elon Musk to change an Austin. Not everybody is a game-changer. We’re finding people who can overnight move hundreds of jobs and that’s how cities and economies are transformed. Those jobs will create more jobs and at the end of the day a rising tide lifts all boats.”

LUV,Southwest Airlines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1oYXMtYS1ncmVhdC1uZXctaWRlYS1mb3ItY3VzdG9tZXJzLXRoZW4taXQtcnVpbmVkLXRoaW5ncy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines had a great new idea for customers (then it ruined things),"A touch desperate? Screenshot by ZDNet

I have no strong feelings about Southwest Airlines.

Well no strong negative feelings. Anymore.

Yes the airline once unfairly left me behind at LAX but I've forgiven it. Mostly.

And I've flown Southwest a lot in the past always for short utilitarian trips that were perfectly enjoyable.

Recently however the airline has admitted to its own tortured feelings. And failings.

It can't hire pilots and flight attendants quickly enough. Its technological offerings are still on the slightly dated side. It's also been one of the airlines that have cancelled far too many flights this year.

This may of course be related to not being able to hire pilots nor having the best technology.

I was positively moved though when the airline announced it had stopped to think about the people. It is after all the people's airline: no seat assignments and a general air of everyone being in it together.

Get Away. Really.



This time Southwest had concocted a new type of fare. This is called Wanna Get Away Plus.

Yes four words is a little much for a brand name. But this fare class will allow business types on a budget -- ergo a non-refundable fare -- to make same-day changes without penalty. It will also allow should you need to cancel for the flight credit to be passed to a loved one. Or to a loved one your official loved one knows nothing about.

Though it's unclear how much more this Plus will cost it's surely an exercise in actual human thoughtfulness.

A couple of people at the airline -- or perhaps a whole planeload -- asked themselves what customers would actually think helpful and found a way to deliver it. (For a price.)

Instantly I felt more positive about Southwest.

No please get away.



Yet the timing of this move has been a little awkward. For me at least.

You see Southwest has suddenly become extremely needy.

Also: Southwest Airlines has excellent news for everyone (except Bill Gates)

Where in the past I might get a couple of emails a month offering some marvelous -- but inappropriate -- deal March saw a frenzy.

It began with the offer of $59 flights that were ""about to leave town."" It continued with my last chance to earn a Companion Pass.

There was a reversion to offering low fares. Perhaps those $59 flights had endured engine trouble -- or a pilot shortage -- and the planes were still at my home airport.

Within days Southwest was desperate to tell me that I could ""save up to 40% on points right now.""

Five days later: ""$49 sale. You lucky duck!""

And we weren't even through half the month.

There followed entreaties to more low fares a repeat of the points savings an offer to earn 40000 points toward my ""next adventure"" and then an offer to save 20% if I booked with points.

A total of 15 emails in 28 days.

None of these offers was compelling.

This all felt like a former lover who simply wouldn't let go. Even after they'd found someone else.

How much luv is too much luv?



Regular readers will know I have a certain concern about businesses that email you too many times. Yes you can unsubscribe from the list but then you might miss something useful.

Yet an email every couple of days says little about the receiver and a lot about the sender.

Also: American Airlines pilots want customers to know how bad things have gotten

Recently I enjoyed a splendid customer experience at Best Buy. This didn't stop the company from emailing me 18 times in a very short period.

Email marketers don't seem to agree on how many emails are too much.

A customer however becomes attuned to how often a particular company chooses to contact them. When that rhythm is disrupted you feel as if there's something wrong. With the company that is.

It's not as if all airlines have done this. American Airlines for one has been pleasantly measured in how they've emailed me and what messages they've used.

This sudden neediness won't stop me from flying Southwest -- which prides itself on ""LUV"" -- should the occasion dictate. But it does make me wonder just how aggressively the airline will market itself in the future -- and whether that'll work.

Southwest enjoys an enormous amount of customer goodwill. It has however an imperfect record with email marketing.

Last year Southwest kept emailing me to say I'd left a flight to a woebegotten city in my cart when I hadn't even contemplated flying to said woebegotten city.

This was deeply annoying. And now Southwest is coming across as a touch desperate.

It's going to be OK Southwest. You're one of four airlines that together hold more than 80% of all the seats in America.

I have a feeling you'll do alright when the masks finally come off and business really picks up.

Unless you still can't hire enough staff that is.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEwNjgwMjU3L1NvdXRod2VzdC1BaXJsaW5lcy1hcG9sb2dpemVzLWRlbGF5cy1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb25zLTItMDAwLWZsaWdodHMtYmxhbWluZy10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWlzc3Vlcy5odG1s0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTA2ODAyNTcvYW1wL1NvdXRod2VzdC1BaXJsaW5lcy1hcG9sb2dpemVzLWRlbGF5cy1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb25zLTItMDAwLWZsaWdodHMtYmxhbWluZy10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWlzc3Vlcy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines apologizes delays and cancellations of 2000 flights blaming 'technology issues',"Flights with Southwest Airlines were subject to nearly 2000 delays or cancellations throughout Saturday with the company blaming it on a failure of its IT systems.

As of 9 p.m. FlightAware.com showed there had been 470 cancellations over the course of Saturday with 1438 delays - about 40 percent of all flights flown.

'We are experiencing flight disruptions across our network today due to briefly pausing our service earlier this morning as we worked to resolve an intermittent technology issue as well as ongoing weather challenges impacting multiple areas within our system' the airline wrote on Twitter.

'We offer our heartfelt apologies for any inconvenience and we will continue to work with Customers who experience a disruption in their travel plans.'

The airline cited 'intermittent performance issues following routine overnight maintenance of some of its backend technology'

Although not specifically Southwest Airlines a 'misery map' depicted a number of delays across the country on Saturday including Miami Chicago New York and Washington D.C.

FlightAware showed more than 460 cancelled flights and 1380 delays

There were dozens of frustrated travelers who posted on social media about how their weekend travel plans had been ruined.

One traveler who experienced a five-hour delay with the airline expressed their disappointment on Twitter.

'So @SouthwestAir just going to continue to delay the flight and not offer any explanation of what's going on or why?? Like people do not have plans? This is so ridiculous I am now going to miss my entire event due to this. I need some type of compensation for this.'

Initially the source of delays was a 'planned system outage' according to KPRC where Southwest's IT was down for two hours starting at 4 a.m.

The airline blamed 'intermittent performance issues following routine overnight maintenance of some of its backend technology' but the outage appeared to last at least an hour longer with delays affecting Southwest flights across the nation including Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington D.C.

Some passengers tweeted their itineraries online which showed delays getting later and later

Southwest Airlines flights were delayed and canceled throughout Saturday

On April Fool's Day Southwest put up this cocky tweet. It didn't seem so funny on Saturday to those traveling with the airline

On Friday the airline made a joke in appreciation of April Fool's Day.

'You want a joke? Bag fees' the @SouthwestAir account wrote but the tweet didn't sit well one day later.

'Kind of bad taste to make a Twitter joke when seemingly every flight today is delayed' wrote Ryan Breton in response.

'Nice April Fools Day - You have hundreds and hundreds of passengers in Chicago that you can't get on planes and you have a hundreds more in Saint Louis and that's just what I seen - how about less jokes and more results' tweeted Christopher Dabek.

'A joke is you cancelling my families flight out of Orlando for no reason. THEN cancelling our rebooked flight within 8 hours before take off. Unacceptable. Now we are stranded with no hotel and no way of getting home. Never flying Southwest again' added B. Hopt.

'This is almost as funny as receiving a text at 11:30 pm saying your am flight is cancelled. The punchline is sitting on hold for 2-1/2 hours waiting to speak to a representative to re-schedule a flight. You guys dig deep on April fools' wrote another Twitter user.

A Twitter joke from one day earlier suddenly wasn't quite so funny to those affected by delays

On Friday Alaska Airlines had canceled more than 100 flights affecting more than 15000 passengers along the West Coast as off-duty pilots picketed during an impasse in contract negotiations that have lasted nearly three years

About 9 percent of the airline's flights were canceled including 66 in Seattle 20 in Portland Oregon 10 in Los Angeles and seven in San Francisco according to the flight tracking website flightaware.com.

Pilots held a nationwide rally and picket line in all those cities according to the Alaska Airlines Pilots union who levied the blame on the airline for failing to staff up now that more Americans are traveling in a post-pandemic world.

'Alaska Airlines failed to properly plan for increased travel demand and take the steps necessary to ensure it attracted and retained pilot' the union said in a statement adding that those picketing were off-duty and would not have contributed to the cancellations.

The airline said in a statement that it admitted to falling short of serving thousands of customers but also tried to put the blame on the pilots for continuing delays that could go into the weekend.

'It takes everyone at Alaska to run a successful and reliable operation' the company said 'We're grateful for all employees who are working hard to get our guests to where they need to go.'

The cancellations and picketing come as air travel rebounds to pre-pandemic levels and demand is surging as many Americans head off on Spring Break for long-delayed vacations.

On Saturday Alaska had far fewer issues with 79 flights cancelled and 81 delayed.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.41%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Global Cost Reduction Program Supporting Gross Margin Expansion

The Company continued executing a series of initiatives that are expected to generate $1.5 billion of pre-tax run-rate cost savings by the end of 2024 growing to $2 billion by the end of 2025. Of the $2 billion savings $1.5 billion is expected to be delivered through a supply chain transformation that leverages strategic sourcing drives operational excellence consolidates facilities and optimizes the distribution network and reduces complexity of the product portfolio.

These actions are expected to return adjusted gross margins* to historical 35%+ levels. Additionally the Global Cost Reduction Program is expected to optimize the Company's cost base to fund investments that accelerate growth in core businesses.

The Global Cost Reduction Program generated incremental pre-tax run-rate cost savings in first quarter 2024 of $145 million. Since inception of the program in mid-2022 the Company has generated approximately $1.2 billion in pre-tax run-rate savings and reduced inventory by $1.9 billion.

The organization is focused on delivering margin expansion cash generation and balance sheet strength while working together to position the Company for long-term growth and value creation.""

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

Starbucks baristas at its New York City Reserve Roastery voted 46-36 in favor of forming a union on Friday dealing a blow to incoming interim CEO Howard Schultz that may be more personal.

The Reserve Roastery is the ninth company-owned Starbucks to unionize. On Tuesday the National Labor Relations Board counted votes for a Knoxville cafe but a challenged ballot left the results of that effort uncertain. The union was winning by a single vote. Last week a cafe in Starbucks' hometown of Seattle and a second location in Mesa Arizona also voted to unionize.

To date only one location has held an election and voted against unionizing under Workers United an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union. However the union pulled a petition for a union election for Roastery manufacturing workers who were slated to cast their votes on Thursday.

Friday's win for Starbucks Workers United represents more than just another location in the growing tally of unionized cafes. Starbucks opened the nearly 23000-square-foot cafe in Manhattan's meatpacking district in December 2018 during the tenure of CEO Kevin Johnson. But the luxurious store and others like it was actually the brainchild of former CEO Schultz who retakes the top job Monday on an interim basis as Johnson retires.

""I'm proud of the culmination of our efforts to make our workplaces more democratic and equitable. Community is a value near and dear to my heart and I am grateful and joyous to be in solidarity with my peers"" said Ley Kido"" Starbucks partner of 9 years.

The Reserve Roasteries located in cities like Seattle Shanghai and Milan were meant to be immersive upscale coffee experiences to attract both tourists and city-dwellers alike. Schultz wanted to open several dozen of them but Johnson said in 2019 the company would scale back on those ambitious plans. The last one opened launched in Chicago that year.

Friday's vote at the New York City Roastery was the first election for Starbucks conducted in person rather than via mail-in ballots.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXBhc3RyeS13YXJtZWQtdGlrdG9rL9IBQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXBhc3RyeS13YXJtZWQtdGlrdG9rLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks workers roast customers who ask for pastries warmed up,"A group of Starbucks workers have a message—if they don’t offer you the ability to warm up your pastry it’s probably because they can’t.

According to a recently-viral video from TikToker Antonio (@boredantonio) if you ask for your pastry warmed up you might get roasted by employees. The video currently has over 77000 views.

https://www.tiktok.com/@boredantonio/video/7081085613713198378

The video shows an employee preparing a pastry order backed by the sound of an audience cheering. But when the customer asks for the pastry to be heated up the crowd boos and employees turn away in disgust.

In comments Antonio clarifies that while their location usually has a heating device it’s “just in the shop getting fixed.”

Commenters were quick to start a debate about the topic. TikTokers rapidly divided themselves by their preference for hot or cold pastries.

“I’m a demon and I like a cold chocolate croissant” wrote one user sarcastically. Another retorted “THEYRE BETTER THAT WAY.”

“U cant get a cold cookie that would ruin it” claimed another. However this also sparked backlash with one commenter writing “Cold cookies are better than warmed cookies at Starbucks.”

Some alleged Starbucks employees claimed in comments that while some pastries may be better warm others suffer in the oven.

“Me when someone orders a lemon loaf [because] I know i’m going through at least two since they seem to disintegrate every time i pull one out” claimed a TikToker. Other alleged employees agreed. “I [be] giving them halfway broken almost” a commenter said. “[I] just hope they don’t see it until they get home.”

But while some TikTokers seemed to have their hot vs. cold preferences set in stone many were content to go with the flow.

As one user wrote “I never ask for my stuff to be warmed up—they always just do it.”

Antonio did not immediately respond to Daily Dot’s request for comment via TikTok comment.

Schultz spent three decades with the Seattle-based company helping grow it from 11 stores to a global brand with over 28000 locations. The company stressed that the position is voluntary and Schultz will receive $1 in compensation.

More than 160 Starbucks locations have filed petitions with the National Labor Relations Board to hold union elections after two Buffalo N.Y. stores completed the unionization process in Dec. 2021. The company reported a record-high for its stock last summer spurring the demand for better wages and benefits.

Schultz never faced a unionization effort and the company faces allegations of intimidation and retaliation against those campaigning and trying to organize the votes.

His return prompted a warning from Sen. Bernie Sanders I-VT to not stand in the way of unionization.

""If Starbucks can afford to spend $20 billion on stock buybacks and dividends and provide a $20 million compensation package to its [outgoing] CEO it can afford a unionized workforce that can collectively bargain for better wages better benefits safer working conditions and reliable schedules"" Sanders wrote to Schultz.

""This is a pivotal moment for Starbucks"" he added. ""As you return to the company it is time to do the right thing: End the union busting and obey the law.""

""No partner has ever needed to have a representative seek to obtain things we all have as partners at Starbucks. And I am saddened and concerned to hear anyone thinks that is needed now"" Schultz wrote.

But some union organizers complain that the company instead provides inconsistent hours poor training understaffing and low wages. Others point to the company’s early days and claim Schultz took a strong anti-union stance after he ascended to his post as CEO of the then-fledgling company.

Terry West a resident in Trenton was one of the two men in disguise startling Trenton residents and state workers alike. “So we saw this on YouTube this prank. It’s usually called “Bushman” and there’s one in Texas. There’s one in Dublin and one in Spain. And we loved it” West said.

The “Bushman” is a popular prank where people disguise themselves as bushes in an urban setting and jolt up startling those that pass by thinking it is a regular bush. West and his prank partner Jose Riviera decided to emulate it in downtown Trenton. “We watch it. We laugh about it all the time. So we decided to order our own ghillie suits from Amazon” West said.

The two sat in pots covered in plants and greenery as unaware Trenton residents and workers alike walk unknowingly into their trap of laughs. There was a lot “oh my gods” followed by laughter and smiles by anyone who walked by. People on their phones were the most susceptible followed by those who weren’t even paying attention.

Trenton resident Reggie Williams explained that he and his girlfriend didn’t even notice them until they jumped out. “I noticed that the trees were different around Starbucks and then my girl she jumped so that made me jump as well. I got scared when she did. It was good I like it though” West said.

With so much tragedy happening in the city this week West thought it would be a good idea to get some laughs as people walked by. “We just crouched down in a pot and just startled people and we thought it would be fun for April Fools’. It was a great way to bring in some laughter at a time when there’s so much sadness” West said.

For those walking by it definitely sparks joy. Emily Gutierrez who works at the Masonic Temple said that she thought something was wrong but couldn’t figure out what until it was too late.

“I knew something was up cause I know the area well” she said. She still got startled by West and Riviera though after it she laughed her heart out. “It’s just nice seeing something fun here I think it’s spreading joy and that’s important” added Gutierrez.

A STARBUCKS employee has become everyone's hero after posting the secret to getting half-price ice lattes every time.

Apparently you can order a doppio espresso on ice and then add the milk yourself for a $1.95 ice latte Eat This reported.

1 Starbucks employees took to Reddit to share secrets about the coffee spot

The former employee posted on Reddit to share cheaper ways to enjoy your favorite drinks at Starbucks.

The user under the name u/jadium said ""An iced venti latte is ~$4 a doppio (two espresso shots) is $1.95 and a cup of ice with two add shots is $1.20.""

""Because you can add as much cold milk as you want from the condiment bar (that island full of sugar packets and carafes) to whatever you're drinking you can ALWAYS ask for an iced venti doppio pay $1.95 then add the milk yourself. Half price lattes.""

The user went on to say they often gave away free drinks to officers in uniform and also teachers.

This is just one of many Starbucks hacks.

You can also enjoy a free drink from Starbucks on your birthday as long as you're a Starbucks cardholder.

You don't even have to make a purchase - just a drink on the house.

However one Starbucks partner said they limit the drink to eight shots of espresso much to the disappointment of some highly caffeinated guests.

You might have heard of a ""puppacino"" which is a little treat that Starbucks employees can give out to dogs.

If you ask for a ""puppacino"" a barista will fill a small sample cup with whipped cream and they actually might really enjoy doing it.

""That's actually one of the things we like giving out the most. Especially through drive if we get to watch the dog enjoy it"" said one Starbucks partner.

""Takes less than 10 seconds to grab a sample cup and fill it with some whip.""

And finally Starbucks employees said to get the best bang for your buck: order an iced coffee.

""The best drink to get if you want something cheap is iced coffee"" said a barista on Reddit. ""You can add any syrup for free and make it taste way better than the lattes.

""Also ask for steamed iced coffee if our coffee is too weak. The baristas will most definitely look at you funny but we literally have to do anything you tell us to.""

This comes as we revealed how you can still get a Starbucks drink after closing time because of one hidden rule.

And the colors of the aprons that baristas wear at Starbucks have a special meaning."

So why would the U.S. General Services Administration now raise a hind leg to this legacy by wrecking the Century and Consumers buildings two early 20th Century skyscrapers at 202 and 220 S. State Street?

Columnists bug Columnists

In-depth political coverage sports analysis entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.



U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin D-Ill last month earmarked $52 million for the GSA to demolish the terra-cotta clad towers and two small buildings between them replacing the ensemble with a safety buffer to protect the Dirksen Federal Building which is located a block west on Dearborn Street.

The GSA owns the buildings and has been seeking the demolition since 2019 about two years after then-U.S. District Court Chief Judge Ruben Castillo told the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin his concerns that Century and Consumers sat close to the Dirksen’s eastern side.

But is this reason enough send the towers to a landfill — when the federal center is surrounded by buildings and through-streets? The Berghoff Restaurant buildings 17 W. Adams St. nearly touch the Dirksen’s north edge but the GSA tells me it has no plans to come after those structures or others.

The feds won’t create a moat around the federal center but replacing the Century and Consumers with a “secure and landscape[d]” site as the GSA spokesperson says is no good either.

The buildings’ demolition would create an economic and pedestrian dead zone on State Street something neither the street nor the city can afford.

And it would be a shameful waste of some really good Chicago architecture.

Preservation deal taken off the table in 2019

The Century and Consumers buildings seemed headed for reuse in 2017 when then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel approved CA Ventures’ $141 million plan to rehab and redevelop the properties.

Under the effort the city would have bought the buildings from the GSA and sold them to CA Ventures. The 22-story Consumers Building would become 270 micro-apartments while the 16-story Century Building would be turned into 159 studio and one-bedroom units.

What a great second act for two historic buildings created by the city’s leading architecture firms. Jenny Mundie & Jensen designed the Consumers Building completed in 1913. Holabird & Roche’s Century Building arrived two years later.

See how the city and the federal government were partners then? In a weird way they still are. When the GSA decided to demolish the buildings following an FBI security assessment in the wake of Castillo’s stance Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the city’s Department of Planning and Development affirmed the move in 2019 by snatching back their support for the CA Ventures deal.

“It’s just disappointing because those are historically-contributing buildings to everything State Street is about” Chicago Loop Alliance President and CEO Michael Edwards told me.

‘We protect these things. We don’t tear them down.’

At least demolition won’t occur suddenly and under the cover of darkness like a certain other thing that happened around this time 20 years ago.

And federally-owned buildings are subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act requiring the GSA to “identify and assess the effects its actions may have on historic buildings ... [and] consider public views and concerns about historic preservation issues when making final project decisions.”

Public meetings on the demolition will begin this summer and continue into 2023 the GSA said. Demolition wouldn’t happen until 2024.

So now’s the time for the Lightfoot administration to step up and make some noise. Maybe even get bold enough to landmark the buildings and dare the feds to tear them down.

Meanwhile the FBI hasn’t publicized its security assessment so we don’t know what dangers to the Dirksen would be prevented by the demolition or if wrecking the structures was the only solution suggested.

Could adding ballistic glass or eliminating windows from the Dirksen-facing side of the buildings help? We don’t know.

“We wrote a letter [to the mayor’s office] that I think went on to the GSA saying that for $52 million you could have [made up] the lost revenue [of not having] any windows on the [Dirksen] side of the building” Edwards said. “And we’d have the historic Chicago fabric that makes State Street that ‘Great Street.’ We protect these things. We don’t tear them down.”

Following the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks the GSA made its buildings open transparent yet security sensitive.

That’s because cooler sensible heads prevailed. And they must again now.

After a site reversal to Brandon S.D. the Huskies were the home team for the first time in conference play this season. St. Cloud State got another dose of great pitching and timely offense to dominate the Cougars at First National Bank Field.Both teams were able to plate runs in the first inning but St. Cloud State was able to take a 2-1 advantage off an RBI single from redshirt sophomore(1-for-4 R RBI) and a sacrifice fly from true freshman(0-for-3 R SF RBI).The Cougars would then tie the game at two in the top of the third inning but that's the only offense they could muster throughout the contest. Redshirt junior(4-for-4 3 R 2B 2 HR (9)) had another incredible play at the plate but not to be overshadowed by him scoring on a wild pitch to give SCSU a 3-2 lead. The Huskies would follow that up with a two out two RBI double by redshirt sophomore(2-for-4 R 2B 2 RBI) and a couple of home runs from Riola in the fifth and sixth innings to cap off an eight-run game.Redshirt junior(CG 3 H 2 R BB 8 K's) gave up a couple of runs in the first three innings of his start but eventually retired 12 straight Cougars in his second straight complete game performance to pick up his fourth win of the season. The Huskies take game one convincingly 8-2.""We really played some good baseball today. I knew from the get-go that if I could pound the zone our team was going to back me up and they would produce at the plate. Hopefully we can get the sweep tomorrow!""Game two featured another similar start with both teams capitalizing on their chances in the first. Senior(0-for-3 SF BB RBI) tied the game at one with a sacrifice fly scoring Nett (3-for-4 3 R 2B BB 2 SB). The Cougars would answer with a run for themselves in the top of the third to take 2-1 lead.St. Cloud State would take control after that Wallat (2-for-5 2B 2 RBI) doubled in the bottom of the fourth to grab the lead back for the Huskies. Eventually senior(1-for-4 2 R SB RBI) plated a run with a sacrifice bunt to push the lead to two.Senior(1.2 IP H 0 R 2 BB 2 K's) and true freshman(3.1 IP H R 4 BB 8 K's) were electric out of the bullpen through the middle innings to stave the Cougars. The Huskies would provide insurance via the long ball sophomore(2-for-4 2 R 2B Solo HR (3)) and Riola (2-for-4 R 3-Run HR (10)) both went deep to give the Huskies a six-run lead.USF was able to scratch across one run in the top of the ninth but it was not enough to force the game to extras and SCSU finished off the double header sweep with an 8-3 victory over Sioux Falls.For all the latest on St. Cloud State Baseball stay tuned to SCSUHuskies.com and follow the team on Twitter Facebook and Instagram",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9hbi1leHRpbmN0LWJlYXItc2l6ZWQtYmVhdmVyLWNvdWxkLWJlLWNob3Nlbi1hcy1taW5uZXNvdGFzLXN0YXRlLWZvc3NpbC82MDAxNjE2NzAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An extinct bear-sized beaver could be chosen as Minnesota's state fossil,"Sometime between the debate over election administration and a bill to create an entirely new state agency in Minnesota the giant beaver teeth were carefully brought up to the testifier's table.

These incisors were so big a paleontologist used two hands to show them off to members of a Minnesota Senate committee last week.

And they were notably old belonging to a giant beaver that lived and died in Minneapolis roughly 10000 years ago. Now the only question was: Should these old giant beaver teeth be a symbol of the state of Minnesota?

""It's been a pretty long couple of years and the problems flying in the state are innumerable"" said Sen. Jim Abeler R-Anoka recognizing his bill was not like the others on the agenda that day. ""If you ask the question: really a state fossil?""

Turns out Minnesota has a lot of state symbols. The state bird is a loon the state drink is a glass of milk the state sport is ice hockey. We've claimed the University of Minnesota-bred Honeycrisp apple as our state fruit and blueberry as our official muffin.

So why not a state fossil?

""It's still a good time to remember our history and what we think is important to the state"" Abeler said adding: ""If you were going to have a state fossil you'd want to have something as cool as the giant beaver.""

Castoroides ohioensis commonly known as the giant beaver is an extinct bear-sized animal that roamed North America alongside woolly mammoths and relatives of the saber tooth cat. Minnesota is one of only six states that have not designated a state fossil so the Science Museum in St. Paul decided to poll residents on which fossil they liked best.

Minnesotans decisively identified with the industrious giant beaver.

""We had lots of other great things from fossilized bacteria to mammoths to giant crocodiles and sharks but what won the vote by a lot was the giant beaver"" said Alex Hastings the paleontology curator at the museum.

More than 11000 people voted across the state — mostly students and families — and the giant beaver ""was the very very clear winner"" he said.

Senators didn't pose any questions on the bill — or the beaver — but they made clear they can multitask debating major legislation about state government and proposals about fossils. The bill was laid over for possible inclusion in a broader package of bills later in the session.

If it becomes law a picture of the giant beaver will be displayed in the entryway of the office of the Secretary of State taking its place alongside photographs of Minnesota's other state symbols.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwZWN0cnVtLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDQvMDIvaHVnZS1jcm93ZHMtZ2F0aGVyLXN0LWdlb3JnZS1kaXhpZS1wb3dlci1raXRlLWZlc3RpdmFsLzcyNDYwNjkwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Huge crowds gather in St. George for Dixie Power Kite Festival,"Thousands of visitors and their kites flooded into Dixie State University for the 23rd annual Dixie Power Kite Festival on Saturday.

Held annually since 2000 the popular springtime event hasn't missed a year since continuing through the COVID-19 pandemic according to Rick Schofield the festival director. Dixie Power the power cooperative is the main sponsor and has been supporting the festival since its beginning.

“The purpose is to raise funds for literacy"" Schofield said explaining that area elementary schools all hand out reading charts to students during the school year. When students read they can turn in their charts for a kite.

This year there were 80 vendors at the festival which is 20 more than last year. Another change this year was an expansion to two stages for performances. T-Mobile was the presenting sponsor.

“So for the past 22 years we have donated almost $700000 to the Washington County School District Foundation"" Schofield said of the festival noting that Dixie Power is the lead sponsor. ""Without them this would not be possible.""

Hundreds of volunteers help with setup and operating the festival. In a typical year the event helps raise $50000 to $60000 for area schools Schofield said.

An estimated 20000 to 30000 people were expected to attend according to Steven Young a communication specialist with Dixie Power.

“Our whole goal with the festival is to donate a big check to the Washington County School District Foundation at the end of the day” Young said.

Though Dixie Power is the main sponsor for the event the Washington County School District Foundation also participates during the festival. The school district buys books for $1 and sells them at the festival for the same amount then hands out kites to kids who have finished their reading charts signed off by parents.

“This all goes towards literacy in those elementary classrooms"" said Steven Dunham the director of communications for the Washington County School District.

Though the Dixie Kite Festival is meant to encourage literacy in children it also serves as an annual event that those without children can enjoy too. There is live entertainment and several food vendors that come each year with a carnival-style feel.

“So the event really kind of encompasses anybody because if you're a school-aged kid and you're doing your reading you get a free guide or book or whatever. But if you're not doing that you can just come and enjoy the festival. We've got entertainment going from 10 to seven on two stages this year. We've gotten vendors from all over the city if you like kind of the carnival feel with fun pictures or whatever that kind of stuff. And it's just a good event to be able to come to see what businesses have to offer here in St. George” Young said.

This art piece is called “Succor Blue” and is made of shades of blue fabric and an outline of a sleeping person with a teddy bear. Succor means comfort and this piece definitely exudes that feeling.

One of the frustrating aspects of life as the country dealt with Covid-19 during 2020 and 2021 was how many important events either got dropped completely or were moved to a virtual setting.

Everyone tried to do the best they could under the circumstances but it just wasn’t the same. One such incredible accomplishment that got lost in the shuffle was gained by Stryker High School Art Student Victoria Bost.

Victoria is now a senior and will be graduating with the Stryker Class of 2022 so it seemed a fitting time to bring to light some of those amazing moments that went unnoticed.

In December of 2020 Victoria submitted her acrylic painting with embroidery (mixed media) called “Rainbow Connection.” When speaking about this piece Victoria said that she had no underlying agenda.

She was just having fun with the rainbow colors and also wanted to try her hand with darker skin tones. Considering it was her first time to try that she did tremendously well winning a great award for her efforts.

For the region in which Stryker participates with art the Fort Wayne Museum of Art received 1410 individual art submissions of which 417 were awarded a Gold Key Silver Key or Honorable Mention.

Victoria Bost was awarded a Gold Key award for “Rainbow Connection” and an Honorable Mention for a charcoal/pastel piece called “Translucent Stripes.”

But wait there is more! Victoria was also nominated for the prestigious American Visionary Award for “Rainbow Connection” along with only four others from this region.

These five were labeled “Best of Show” and even though she did not win that award her piece was sent on with the other four to compete in the National Scholastic Art Show for 2021. Across the nation all Regional Gold Keys go to Nationals.

For her Gold placement she was given a Gold Key award and recognized for her American Visions Award at the 2021 Regional Awards Ceremony on Sunday February 14 2021.

Her artworks along with an Honorable mention earned by another Stryker 2022 Senior Karina Guthrie (water color/ink piece called “All Seeing”) as well as other regional artwork were placed on exhibit at the Fort Wayne Museum of Art for the 2021 High School Scholastic show which ran from February 13- April 10 2021.

Moving on with “Rainbow Connections” the piece was sent on to compete in the National Scholastic Art Show. Much to the joy and surprise of both Victoria Bost and her Art Teacher Mrs. Laura Moser “Rainbow Connections” was judged in the National judging and was awarded a National Gold medal!

This is where it was a little disappointing for them. As thrilled as they were they did not get to go to New York City for the National Scholastic Arts Gala and Awards Ceremony that is normally held.

COVID stole that from the hundreds of art students across the country who had looked forward to the excitement of that moment but she did get to be a part of online ceremonies for Regional and National results.

Mrs. Moser could not say enough about how amazing this award was for Victoria for herself and for the Stryker Schools. “This is the biggest national honor any art student has ever received during my twenty years at Stryker” she said.

Moser was also given a gold medal when Victoria received hers as she was the Educator/Teacher who helped her get to that point. She proudly has it hanging on the wall in the Stryker Art Room.

Besides being awarded a plaque for her Visionary Award and the Gold Key regionally Victoria was asked to create a video which was put into the virtual show online for Scholastics;for Nationals she and Mrs. Moser were each awarded their own gold medal; Victoria was given a sign to put in her yard and tickets to see the show; and Her artwork was printed in a book called Best Teen Art 2021 for Scholastics as well.

Victoria is very happy about all that has happened as Art means the world to her. She is very serious about Art and said that one of her favorite things to do is to wander around alone in a Museum of Art taking her time enjoying each piece.

“I can spend hours in a museum” she said adding that she prefers to be alone as she doesn’t want to talk about it just soak it in.

Another thing she loves is doing Mixed media art pieces. With “Rainbow Connection” she painted the picture first and then embroidered a number of sections of the piece including the lips of the lady the head piece the leaves and vines. It is a bright colorful piece of art reminiscent of things seen in the Dominican Republic.

This year has been full as well for Victoria as she has enjoyed taking three art classes with Mrs. Moser. They reminisced that she was in Mrs. Moser’s art classes in the 4th grade one semester of 8th grade and has taken Digital 2D Glass and Independent class (twice) during her high school years.

She spent half a year in Bryan as she wanted to finish out the year with virtual classes but then decided to come back to Stryker because she wanted to continue her study under Mrs. Moser.

“RAINBOW CONNECTIONS” … This specific piece of art has won the artist 18 year-old Victoria Bost a Gold Key regionally a nomination for American Visionary Award and a place in the National Scholastic Art Show where it won a Gold Medal! It is a mixed media of acrylic painting with embroidery. The National award is the highest award anyone has gotten during her Art Teacher’s 20 years at Stryker. Mrs. Laura Moser is very proud and happy for her student. (PHOTO PROVIDED)

Recently the Black Swamp Art Show was held out at Northwest State Community College and Victoria had a few pieces on display there.

One called “Pieces of Me” was a large clear broken vase with some pieces lying around the base with dates written on them.

When asked about the meaning or significance of this piece she explained that it was her expression of going through some very difficult situations in her childhood and as a teen.

She wanted that one to show people that the biggest hurtful moments in life can be seen and a measure of healing can happen when we face them.

Breaking the vase studying what glue was needed to repair it only partially repairing it and then writing dates on certain pieces that commemorated horrible moments for her all brought some healing.

“I want people to know that you don’t know what has happened to people or what they have gone through” she said. “Pieces of Me is probably the deepest meaningful piece I have done.”

“It was like a puzzle. I wanted it to give off the feeling that even though I have had so much happen to me I am still hanging together.”

She and Mrs. Moser agreed that over this past year Victoria’s art has been a lot more expressive in symbolism. Before this she stuck to technical training as she was struggling with coping with some circumstances but now that she is moving into more expressive artwork she finds she is healing more.

Concerning the glue for “Pieces of Me” they spoke of how even that reminded them of life. Mrs. Moser said “We all need the right glue” just like the glass piece needed a specific kind of glue to work.

Also in the Black Swamp display and now on display in the Art Room Window is “Succor Blue.” Succor is a very old word for comfort or assistance and support in times of hardship and distress.

Victoria made a mixed media of fabrics all in shades of blue and a teddy bear to show a sweet moment of peace. It draws one in and makes one want to touch it which is what she said had been her hope as the teddy bear is extremely soft and brings a comfort to the viewer.

This young lady will go far in the art world. After graduation she is planning to check into possibilities to hold classes that will help others find healing through creativity.

She also thinks she might want to move to a large city where there would be more opportunities in the art world. Whatever she does she is to be congratulated for the accomplishments she has already achieved!

SMCI,Supermicro,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vc3VwZXJtaWNyby14MTFzZHYtNGMtdHA4Zi1yZXZpZXctd2l0aC1pbnRlbC14ZW9uLWQtMjEyM2l0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supermicro X11SDV-4C-TP8F Review with Intel Xeon D-2123IT,"It has been some time since we have done an embedded motherboard review. Since we had one cycle through the lab due to a new rack we are provisioning we had the chance to take a look at the Supermicro X11SDV-4C-TP8F which is an Intel Xeon D-2123IT motherboard with a lot of networking onboard.

Note: This is a review that was apparently written many months ago about a motherboard in the E300D-4C-4CN8TP system. It got caught just before some big launches so it never went live. At the same time this is a motherboard we probably have in 8-10 systems at this point so we figured we may as well publish the review before we get into our Ice Lake-D (Xeon D-1700 and Xeon D-2700 review series.)

Supermicro X11SDV-4C-TP8F Overview

The Supermicro X11SDV-4C-TP8F may seem a bit of an unusual size. It is a Flex ATX motherboard which is 9″ x 7.25″ whereas a standard mITX motherboard is 6.7″ x 6.7″ and a mATX motherboard would be 9.6″ x 9.6″.

The reason for this size is very interesting. It turns out that this platform fits well in both the Supermicro 1U short-depth platforms like the Supermicro CSE-505-203B but also the embedded chassis like the CSE-E300. Supermicro has servers the 5019D-4C-FN8TP and the E300-9D-4CN8TP we reviewed that utilize this motherboard in both of those cases.

Onboard we have an Intel Xeon D-2123IT. This is a 4 core/ 8 thread SoC that operates at up to 60W TDP. One item we should note is that these CPUs generally use more power than the Xeon D-1500 processors but they have a very nice feature. The cores are Skylake like the first generation Intel Xeon Scalable parts and the I/O is effectively handled by the same IP found in the Lewisburg PCH found on first and second-generation Intel Xeon Scalable systems. Given this is effectively the mainstream platform for Intel from 2017 to 2021 (and the Lewisburg Refresh for the Cooper/ Ice platform has some of the same IP) that means this platform has excellent software support at this point.

Flanking the Xeon D-2123IT we have four DDR4 DIMM slots. This memory operates at up to DDR4-2133/2400 speeds and one can populate up to 4x 128GB LRDIMMs in the platform for 512GB of memory. This also means we get more memory bandwidth and more memory bandwidth per core than the dual-channel 4-core AMD EPYC 3000 parts such as the AMD EPYC 3151.

In terms of expansion this motherboard is quite interesting due to the Flex ATX size which offers more room than the mITX platforms like the Supermicro X11SDV-4C-TLN2F we reviewed with this same chip. We get a PCIe 3.0 x16 and x8 slot for standard expansion slots. That is not all though. We also get a mPCIe slot a M.2 2280 (PCIe 3.0 x4) and a M.2 B-key slot for wireless WAN connectivity. There is even a SIM card slot under the B-Key 3042 slot.

For SATA SSD connectivity one has four onboard standard 7-pin SATA ports.

It also has two high-density ports which can each break out into four additional SATA ports for twelve total.

The interesting connectivity does not end there. One also gets a plentiful I/O panel. As we would expect there are legacy VGA ports two USB 3.0 ports and a RJ45 port for the out-of-band AST2500 management.

Networking goes well beyond this one gets four 1GbE ports powered by an Intel i350-am4 controller.

The 10Gbase-T ports are powered via an Intel X557 NIC. The dual SFP+ 10GbE ports are powered by the Intel Xeon D-2123IT. That is a lot of connectivity options in a small package.

Next we are going to look at the topology management and performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,

My apartment is at the edge of Chicago's Little Vietnam stretch and pho ga from Nhà Hàng Vietnam Restaurant has quickly become my go-to post-work comfort food. Typically it's served with a small platter packed with basil bean sprouts a slice or two of jalapeño and a wedge of lime.

I figured it was maybe just a produce order fluke until I popped into yet another Vietnamese restaurant Pho 888 to grab takeout and I overheard a customer ask for a slice of lime. The waiter responded with a sigh: ""Sorry no lime. Only lemon right now."" I asked a couple restaurant owners on the block and they reported the same thing. Limes were seemingly impossible to secure in bulk — at least at a decent price.

Initially I thought this was potentially a regional issue but a friend in Louisville Kentucky told me he'd had a similar conversation with the owner of a Mexican restaurant in town; when I called to confirm the owner reported that wholesale limes had doubled in price from $75 for a crate that would typically last a week to $150.

In fact according to an April 1 edition of Fresh Point a bulletin compiled by Sysco limes — along with items like strawberries certain mushrooms and watermelons — are on ""alert"" due to limited availability. This is due to as the bulletin put it ""temps strong demand and very little rain.""

That's just a taste however of the issues plaguing the lime industry right now. The current limited availability of this simple piece of citrus is actually a perfect opportunity to better understand our — for better or worse — increasingly global food system and what propels or prevents certain ingredients from being readily available on supermarket shelves.

Almost 79% of the limes sold in the United States are imported from Mexico and as the Mexican Servicio de Información Agroalimentaria y Pesquera in Mexico reported in January 2022 prices had tripled when compared to prices in 2021 from 17 pesos to 56 pesos per kilo.

Some of this is due to natural causes. Lime growers are still reeling from 2020 droughts and severe flooding in early 2021 according to the Produce Bluebook. This year has brought an uncharacteristically cold growing season which literally freezes the growth of limes making them ineligible for sale.

However another issue underlying lime availability is long-running and complicated cartel tensions in major growing areas across Mexico.

As The Guardian reported in February cartels are imposing increasing controls over producers during the bumper crop season – in part to fund an escalating war in the western state of Michoacán where the aggressive expansion of the Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación has unleashed a bitter conflict with a coalition of local groups known as the United Cartels.

""The lime trade is a billion-dollar industry and for any criminal group it's very easy and extremely profitable for them to go to the farmers and tell them what they need to pay for protection"" Romain Le Cour security and violence reduction program officer at the thinktank México Evalúa ""It's classic mafia.""

Additional reports also detail how the Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación displaced local growers in 2019 took over operations for themselves and then abandoned those operations several months later; the effects of that disruption are still being felt today — by the farmers agricultural workers importers and members of the culinary industry in both Mexico and the United States.

Many restaurants have shifted to serving dishes with lemon like Nhà Hàng because it's much more affordable. Meanwhile bartenders are having to adjust how they serve cocktails — especially classic cocktails like daiquiris and mules which rely on lime.

Some are taking a page from White Lyan a now-closed but pioneering cocktail bar that had a limeless daiquiri made with a science kit combination of powdered citric acid malic acid tartaric acid and phosphoric acid mixed with water and salt. Others like Eron Plevons of Louisville's GOLD BAR rely on housemade ""super juice"" a technique that was perfected by bartender Nickle Morris of Bar Expo.

As Salon reported in 2020 Morris makes the superjuice by combining citrus peel which is typically discarded with citric and malic acid. After sitting for four to eight hours the mixture is blended with water and strained. The resulting super juice can be stored in a refrigerator for up to a week.

""Super juice cuts your cost down to a third"" Plevon wrote in a Facebook message. ""Depends on volume but you can get one liter of bright citrus juice outta 6 lemons or limes. Totally worth it. If you buy 18 large limes/lemons you have what you need for the week [and it] keeps for a week rather than 24 hours.""

But for those who don't have the time or resources to make ""fake lime juice"" or super juice their options are likely a slapdash mix of lemon and bitters or bottled lime juice. Grocers are pushing the latter option pretty hard. Dents and Cents a discount food shop in Jackson Missouri posted on Facebook: ""FYI there is now a lime shortage. We have a ton of this Realime for just $1.00 per bottle!""

It's worth finding a solution though because this isn't the first lime shortage — the Atlantic reported about the ""The Great Lime Shortage"" in 2014 — and with climate change and unpredictable cartel activity it likely won't be the last. For now maybe we shift to drinking our spring G&Ts with a slice of lemon.

As undergraduates complete their degrees the ability to interact with leading prospective employers and plan career pathways are crucial to their future. Empowering students with perfect opportunities towards dream careers the SLIIT Career Guidance Unit successfully organised a series of events recently with international ICT companies in attendance.

The unique two-day ‘Career Expo’ initiative organised in collaboration with the SLIIT Career Guidance Unit and the SLIIT Rotaract Club was successfully held from 11th to the 12th of March at the SLIIT Auditorium. The main objective of the programme was to provide students and graduates with a multitude of job opportunities from many potential companies. The extremely productive event witnessed over 500 SLIIT undergraduates and graduates meeting with top employers facing interviews and even gaining internships.

Expanding students’ horizons SLIIT partners with several leading business organisations to provide undergraduates a platform to demonstrate their skills build networks and explore careers. The SLIIT Career Guidance Unit held several Career Days with leading technology companies Sysco LABS Virtusa IFS and HCL to help students gain job placements.

The Sysco LABS Exclusive Career Day was successfully held on the 26th of February 2022 with the participation of 300+ undergraduates and graduates. Notably Sysco LABS offered many Software Engineering and Quality Assurance placements during the Career Day.

The Virtusa on-campus Career Day took place on 17th February 2022 with 300+ undergraduates and graduates participating. Virtusa presented 27+ Software Engineering and Quality Assurance permanent job offers during the career day and to-date have recruited 120+ fresh graduates as permanent employees during the months of February and March 2022.

The IFS Career Day was successfully held on the 15th of February 2022 with the participation of 600+ undergraduates and graduates. IFS offered 40+ Software Engineering and Quality Assurance permanent jobs during the event.

SLIIT Career Guidance Unit also organised the HCL Career Day last December. 200+ SLIIT graduates and undergraduates participated in the event. Students were able to gain an understanding about the multiple vacancies available at HCL Technologies Lanka along with valuable insights in becoming a respected IT professional. One-to-one discussions were arranged for the graduates and undergraduates to develop their career pathways.

Continuing its work to assist undergraduates successfully join the future workforce the SLIIT Career Guidance Unit will be organising its Annual SLIIT Career Week in September. Employers will have access to meet SLIIT 3rd-year Undergraduates from the Faculties of Business Computing Engineering Humanities and Sciences seeking industrial placements. Additionally undergraduates completing their final year end semester examinations in May 2022 and graduating in September 2022 will also be attending the event.

Don't worry you're not alone and you're probably not having an out-of-body experience. The latest trend in spam text messages involves mobile phone users receiving texts from what appears to be their own phone number. The messages typically claim to be from the user's wireless carrier referencing the recipient's wireless bill and including a link to a ""free gift."" Spoiler alert: The link leads to potentially malicious websites instead according to users on Reddit and Twitter. It's all potentially very confusing. Here's what you need to know about these spam texts and what you can do about them:

Why am I getting these texts?

On Monday The Verge reported that the phenomenon appears to only affect Verizon Wireless customers. A Verizon spokesperson confirmed the issue in a statement to CNBC Make It. ""As part of a recent fraud scheme bad actors have been sending text messages to some Verizon customers which appear to come from the customers' own number"" Verizon spokesperson Rich Young said. ""Since uncovering the scheme our company has made a significant effort to limit the current activity."" Young noted a recent uptick in spam text messages across all wireless carriers and said Verizon is ""actively working with others in our industry and with U.S. law enforcement as part of an investigation aimed at identifying and stopping these fraudsters and their illegal actions.""

Robokiller a company that makes a mobile app to block spam calls and texts said it had tracked more than 5000 incidents of the same-number spam text messages over the past week as of Thursday. According to Robokiller typical versions of the spam texts feature messages that say ""Free Msg: Your bill is paid for March"" along with a dubious link that claims to offer a free gift. In other cases the spam message includes a link that claims to take the recipient to a Verizon survey according to CNET. A writer for The Verge noted that clicking on the link in one particular message took the writer to the website for Channel One Russia a television network run by the Russian government. ""We have no indication of any Russian involvement"" in the spam texts Young said. A spokesman for AT&T told CNBC Make It: ""We are monitoring this situation closely and have not seen anything similar on our network."" A spokesperson for T-Mobile did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.

What about other kinds of spam texts?

The recent spate of same-number spam texts comes amid a rise in overall spam texts received by U.S. wireless customers in recent years. Last year the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) warned that spam texts have been rising during the Covid-19 pandemic with scammers more likely to prey on desperate Americans suffering from health or financial hardships. Robokiller said Americans received a total of 87.8 billion spam text messages in 2021 a 58% increase from the previous year. Spam texts are often referred to as SMS phishing or ""smishing"" attacks where scammers try to trick wireless users into sharing personal information or clicking on malware-ridden links. In some cases spammers trick your phone's Caller ID to make it seem like a text or call is coming from a local or government-associated number a practice called ""spoofing."" In the case of the same-number spam texts it appears that ""bad actors"" are even able to spoof recipients' own numbers – adding another layer to the process.

Easy enough for Hollywood to fake something like that. But it may not be as far-fetched as you think. A company called Mojo Vision is working on a prototype contact lens that's flexing some pretty impressive powers.

CNET's Scott Stein got to try out the Mojo Lens a few weeks back and he reports on how far along it is toward practical reality. A hard lens it has a monochrome green display that can show text basic graphics and even some illustrations and with its accelerometer gyro and magnetometer it can also now do eye tracking.

It’s so nice to have baseball back.

This past offseason hasn’t been easy for baseball fans. The contentious 99-day lockout nearly ate into the season and did result in a shortened spring training. But in the end a deal did get done which means we can all enjoy big-league games again.

The 2022 season is special because it’ll be the first time since 2019 that every stadium is open at full capacity for Opening Day. Baseball is at its best when there’s a full stadium of fans to enjoy it. So it’s as good a time as ever to break out our For The Win MLB stadium rankings.

Going off the similar — and admittedly subjective — criteria of general atmosphere design location amenities food and character that we used in 2016 and 2020 we’ve arrived at an updated rankings of MLB ballparks to get ready for the 2022 baseball season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYWhsLmNvbS9kb2xsYXItbG9hbi1jZW50ZXItYS1qZXdlbC1pbi10aGUtZGVzZXJ00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dollar Loan Center a jewel in the desert,"📝 by Patrick Williams

Henderson Silver Knights general manager Tim Speltz loves his team’s new home for its hockey amenities and what they can mean for developing National Hockey League-bound talent.

Gabe Mirabelli the director of enterprise operations for the Vegas Golden Knights imagines the entertainment possibilities that a state-of-art facility can provide to a fast-growing community inside of a booming metropolitan market like Las Vegas.

For fans well the sightlines and luxurious setting will be appealing. And the players? They have an opportunity to utilize those hockey amenities and skate in a lively atmosphere each game night.

The American Hockey League’s newest arena opened Saturday night with the second-year Silver Knights coronating the $84-million 5567-seat Dollar Loan Center in a meeting with the Bakersfield Condors.

Henderson’s new home is one of three AHL arenas scheduled to debut in 2022. Next season the expansion Coachella Valley Firebirds open their 11000-seat Acrisure Arena. To the north the San Jose Barracuda will move into their own dedicated facility Tech CU Arena. That building will be attached to the club’s Sharks Ice at San Jose practice facility that they share with the parent San Jose Sharks.

“I think it’s going to be nothing but a benefit for the players” Speltz said of his team’s new quarters. “I mean there are some great buildings in the American Hockey League. I think the amenities that we’ll have will be second to none and I think players will greatly enjoy that.”

Saturday’s opening capped a remarkably efficient timeline for the Golden Knights organization and its AHL operation. On Feb. 6 2020 the Golden Knights purchased a franchise membership that the AHL subsequently approved 22 days later. The Silver Knights then began play last season.

Now just shy of 26 months after purchasing the franchise the Golden Knights have a productive AHL affiliate playing inside their market and inside of a brand-new home custom-built for hockey. Demolition of an existing structure began in August 2020 a special ceremony was held two months later and the arena’s first event was the Big West conference men’s and women’s basketball tournaments last month.

“Really when you think about it it was 15 to 16 months [to build] which is pretty incredible” Mirabelli said. “Huge credit to [contracting company] Whiting-Turner. They did an excellent job meeting their timeline and they were done in time to play some hockey.

“It was a full sprint to get to where we are.”

THE COMMUNITY

Dollar Loan Center is located in Henderson a rapidly growing city in the Las Vegas Valley. A 20-minute drive separates Dollar Loan Center from the Las Vegas Strip home to the parent club’s T-Mobile Arena. While Las Vegas is home to numerous sports and entertainment facilities Henderson residents had lacked one of their own away from the packed tourist crowds.

“People come from all over the world to be entertained in Vegas” Mirabelli began. “But you know almost all the venues are on the Strip right? They almost all have their unique niche.

“What we wanted to do when we set out on this venture was we wanted to own Henderson. It is its own city. We wanted to own Henderson we wanted to own families and we wanted to own sports.

“This building [is] kind of in the heart of a community where people can walk to people can ride their bikes and even just walk over from the [Green Valley] District or Green Valley Ranch. It was really an opportunity to bring something different and that’s what we’ve tried to do from the start. We recognize this opportunity and are glad people are excited about it.”

HOCKEY-FIRST

But first and foremost Dollar Loan Center is made for hockey and the design process included considerable input from Golden Knights management with hockey operations president George McPhee and general manager Kelly McCrimmon closely involved.

Henderson’s late-season schedule will enable the Silver Knights ample opportunity to learn their new building before the Calder Cup Playoffs open in May. The Rockford IceHogs come to Dollar Loan Center for a pair of games this week and a seven-game homestand also concludes the Silver Knights’ regular-season schedule.

“I’d like to give credit to our hockey group” Mirabelli recounted. “George Kelly the equipment staff and medical team were intimately involved in the design of that [hockey] space in particular.

“George and Kelly have their fingerprints all over that place. It’s very similar to the layout that we have in T-Mobile. They’ve got what you need to be a top-tier professional athlete. You’ve got your gym space. You’ve got your lounge space where you can do nutrition. The equipment guys have a great little space. They [have] got a separate coaches suite. It’s kind of the wish list every team wants but might not have just because they [did not] build the building or they didn’t run it.”

THE FANS

Said Mirabelli “My favorite thing about the building is how intimate it is. There is not a bad seat which is something that we take a lot of pride in. You can sit anywhere and feel like you’re right on top of the action. We really only have the lower bowl and then a premium level so you’re not you’re not dealing with a ton of different levels sightlines.”

As part of the design process Mirabelli visited different buildings. What did he like? What did he not like? What worked? What did not? He came away inspired by Compton Family Ice Arena home to the University of Notre Dame’s hockey program and the lively atmosphere that a building that size could create.

“That’s the environment that we want to drive” Mirabelli said. “It’s going to be bumping just like T-Mobile. We’ve got a great sound system. Our center-hung is beautiful. Daktronics did a great job. So all the things that we try [to create] in T-Mobile from the fan-experience side led the design and implementation.”

The Craggy Range restaurant is there for hungry hockey-watchers and an outdoor deck offers dramatic views of the Las Vegas skyline and mountain landscape.

A “modern medieval” theme also dominates the building. Before Saturday night’s contest fans mingled in the “Tiltyard” an outdoor plaza. Arena staff wear medieval-style uniforms. Much like the parent club’s home building a castle dominates one end of Dollar Loan Center. Among the medieval-themed nomenclature arena suites in Henderson are named “chambers” while elevators have been renamed “hoists.” Henderson players and staff walked the “silver carpet” before facing Bakersfield.

“I’ve walked the building with a number of guests” Mirabelli said “and the one comment I get consistently is ‘I love the size of the seats and I love the signage.’

“Full credit to our internal designers. They went ahead and actually made the design for [that unique] signage and it’s really really cool. It was a lot of time and a big lift… but it came out fantastic.”

THE PLAYERS

In Saturday’s opener a 5-2 loss for the Silver Knights both Henderson and Bakersfield played a high-pressure late-season game for an energetic sellout crowd a development tool that cannot be replicated in any practice setting. Speltz is also aware that having Dollar Loan Center and a practice facility like Lifeguard Arena will help attract talent to the organization in the future. Amenities matter to players more than ever.

“I think the players they’re looking for opportunity” Speltz said. “We present an opportunity. I think they know that we will live up to the opportunity we do present.

“But… the opportunity for them to play in front of [passionate fans] that excitement I think is fantastic. For players it’s something they enjoy and I think it’s something they relish when they’re trying to perform. From that standpoint I think the atmosphere and the excitement the building will provide will be a great tool for us.”

The three buildings opening in 2022 point to the significant investment that ownership groups are pouring into their AHL operations.

“The standard gets raised with every new building that’s opening” Speltz said. “I think all teams are going to want the best for their prospects so I wouldn’t be surprised if this continues.”"

WTTW Passport members can stream the next episode now. Recap the previous and following episodes.

Sanditon’s Midsummer Fair is approaching and Tom has outsized plans: he has booked an elephant for the festivities. But after he and Arthur poster the county they are outbid on the elephant at the last minute. Arthur manages to secure a giant horse as a replacement but Tom decides to instead take Colonel Lennox up on an offer of something thrilling for the fair. No matter that there are rumors that the army hasn’t paid any of the bills it has accumulated in Sanditon riling the shopkeepers; Tom still wants the army to build a barracks in the town.

Prompt payment is not the only place where the military seems to be dishonest: Captain Carter is so besotted with Alison (and she with him) that he is presenting himself as someone he isn’t. Asking Captain Fraser for help sending her poetry he learns that Fraser has always carried a book of his favorite poems with him in battle and sends Alison a selection from that well-used tome.

While promenading with her he also spins tales of his bravery in battle. Later Alison runs into Fraser in a meadow; they are both collecting flowers. (Fraser says his are for Colonel Lennox; perhaps they are the flowers later sent to Charlotte along with an invitation to accompany the Colonel to the fair.) Caught in a downpour they flee to shelter and Alison rhapsodizes about Carter. When Fraser returns to camp he tells Carter that Alison deserves better than lies about battles he was too young to have fought in.

Georgiana’s difficulty in a budding romantic relationship is not based on false pretenses but an unusual amount of forthrightness. Charles sends her a sketched portrait of her piquing her. She marches to his bohemian abode and chastises him for his boldness. He tells her he would simply like to know her better and then Miss Hankins Georgiana’s chaperone finally catches up to Georgiana and the conversation ends.

As Georgiana explains to Arthur she has always been stared at due to her skin color; Charles’ portrait was that feeling made physical. Arthur tells her that Charles made him feel seen for how he’d like to be seen when the artist sketched him. He believes Charles has an admirably unprejudiced view. Mary may not approve of the artist as a suitor but Arthur who has promised her to watch over Georgiana has taken a liking to him.

Georgiana again visits Charles and tells him that he will paint her portrait on her own terms. He asks her to stay but she turns her back and leaves.

She still has no idea why Sidney was in her birthplace of Antigua on her behalf when he died. Her father sold the plantation and is dead and her mother died while giving birth to her. She is persisting in her sugar boycott despite the scorn of Lady Denham who points out that Georgiana’s fortune was made from her father’s sugar plantation.

Esther fears that Lady Denham’s own fortune is once again under threat from Denham’s dishonored niece Clara. Clara insists that Edward who she claims is the father of her unborn child has ignored all her letters. She is surprised to learn that he is in Sanditon.

Lady Denham summons him and springs Clara on him. He claims that he has not received any letters and that Clara is once again scheming. Lady Denham believes Clara and sends Edward away. He pockets an unopened letter to Esther on his way out and angrily confronts Clara who has been told to stay out of sight lest people learn of more Denham family shame. She tells him his presence is simply a complication; she doesn’t need anything more from him than his child.

Augusta Markham apparently doesn’t need much from Charlotte her purported teacher: the orphaned young woman knows more French than her governess. At least Augusta is around to be taught; Leonora is nowhere to be found. Charlotte searches for her on the expansive grounds of the Colbourne estate and finds its owner trying to calm a horse frightened earlier by the gunfire of military exercises.

Charlotte soothes the frenzied horse and Alexander happily sets off with her to find Leo instead of chastising her for losing his daughter. As they search Charlotte asks him why he avoids spending time with Leo and Augusta sharing that Augusta believes she is a burden upon Alexander. He finds Leo in a tree at that moment and leaves them.

But he apparently heeds Charlotte’s observation. When Leo calls to him to join their picnic later he does. Augusta has been telling Charlotte about her mother who was always sad after her twin sister—Leo’s mother—died.

Augusta and Alexander at first quarrel over when she will be allowed to be independent of him and debut in society but tensions soon ease thanks to Leo’s delight at spending time with her father and Charlotte. When Charlotte packs up to go to the fair everyone admits that they had a wonderful day—even Augusta.

At the fair Charlotte offers to be the first to enjoy the Colonel’s promised attraction: a military observation balloon which everyone else is afraid to try. Lennox ascends with her but they are almost swept out over the ocean when soldiers on the ground lose hold of the balloon’s tether. Arthur of all people manages to grab hold of it and save them. As Charlotte and Lennox disembark everyone else clamors to try the balloon.

Charlotte tells Lennox that her charges and her employer have all started to warm to her. Lennox warns her against Alexander telling her that he was once in love with Lucy Alexander’s late wife before Alexander “stole” her from him and then destroyed her.

Esther stays home from the fair to watch over Clara whom she distrusts absolutely. With everyone gone Clara goes into labor. Esther helps her through it the two of them yelling at each other all the while. Esther is desperate for her own child—she has even given herself intestinal inflammation by taking the herbs of a midwife—and lovingly holds Clara’s baby. Clara herself is less interested in the infant.

The baby is sure to be a bargaining piece in both Clara and Edward’s schemes. When asked by Captain Carter why he is brooding Edward answers that he is soon to be a father—but that such a circumstance may still turn out to be cause for celebration.

Meanwhile Tom is once again drawn into gambling with the military men by Colonel Lennox. He has come to speak to Lennox on behalf of the shopkeepers clamoring for their bills to be paid but is first distracted by dice on Lennox’s urging. When he loses a hundred pounds that he doesn’t have he decides to wait to bring up any owed money.",,,

Currently the entire fleet of public e-vehicles is run by state transport undertakings.All 80 buses introduced in the city were bought under the CAPEX model. The West Bengal Transport Corporation became the sole owner of these buses. ""The OPEX model will be a game-changer as the state does not have to make huge investments at one go"" said transport minister Firhad Hakim ""Buses will generate revenue on a daily basis and they will pay the STUs. It is to some extent like hiring a car. Private operators will run the buses and share a fixed amount per bus with the STUs for using the bus depots and charging infrastructure"" he added.The huge addition of 2000 buses will change the way the city commutes on a daily basis Hakim who is also the city mayor said. Electric buses will resolve the issue of heat-trapping greenhouse emission and counter the ever-rising price of fossil fuels he added. Admitting that all state transport undertakings were struggling to stay afloat because of the back-to-back rise in fuel prices he said electric buses would provide solid financial viability in the long run.The only hurdle is the huge deficit of lithium-ion e-vehicle batteries. ""Most EV manufacturers could not fulfil their order commitments because of this crisis"" said a transport official adding ""One of the biggest manufacturers of dry and wet cells in India will soon start to manufacture EV batteries. Moreover we are also exploring alternative technologies. By some accounts sodium-ion technology is equally effective and available at half the price of lithium-ion batteries.""The Bengal government also proposes special inter-city green corridors for electric vehicles charging stations at 25km intervals and green zones where only non-fossil-fuel vehicles would be allowed to promote EVs with an ambitious target of having 10 lakh such vehicles across all segments and one lakh public or semi-public charging stations according to the state's EV policy 2021.",,,,,,

The contract was signed on March 18 this year and the manufacturer of Rumes 300 Huntington Ingalls Industries [HII] announced the news in a press release on March 30.

The contract includes the production and delivery of multiple UUVs training integration into the fleet spare parts for production hardware and engineering support services. BulgariaMilitary.com recalls that two years ago the Pentagon commissioned through the Department of Defense Innovation to develop a similar device that would meet the requirements of the US Navy for next-generation submarine drones.

Huntington Ingalls Industries says that despite the shortened deadlines they have managed to produce the necessary prototypes in these two years and successfully pass all the evaluations. The United States must acquire the first Remus 300 in 2023.

Rumes 300 UUV

The original developer of Remus 300 is the Norwegian company Hydroid which in 2020 was acquired by Huntington Ingalls Industries and thus became a subsidiary of HII. Initially Remus 300 was developed as a civilian commercial product later the military found another application – intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance [ISR].

The US Navy will use Remus 300 for its intended purpose – intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance mine action search and recovery marine archeology hydrographic commissioning anti-submarine warfare and more.

Remus 300 has an integrated unmanned marine autonomous architecture which will allow easier updating or adding new solutions in the future. The drone weighs 56 kg but this is a standard size. Depending on the mission the drone can be reconfigured and change its weight – from 45 to 67 kg. The operational depth to which the drone can dive is 305 meters.

Remus 300 has dual-frequency sonar with a resolution of up to 5 cm NBOSI conductivity and temperature sensor [CT] and depth sensor TE Connectivity. Additionally there are integrated other sensors and devices such as a 2G Robotics 4K HD camera with a high-intensity LED light strip a Seabird Scientific Eco Puck Triplet environmental sensor and a Klein MA-X sonar that fills the gaps.

The drone has an integrated commercial and military navigation system iXblue Phins C3 [INS] as well as a commercial or optional military system for global positioning Garmin [GPS]. It is powered by a DC brushless motor and has a blade for tilt and tilt control. Depending on the battery it can last underwater for 10 20 or 30 hours. The recharging time for lithium-ion batteries is between 12 and 18 hours.

Investors will be watching to see if there will be any reputational damaged to the U.S. giant.

Tesla just reported first-quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers for 2022.

Here's how they did.

Electric vehicle deliveries (total): 310048

Electric vehicle production (total): 305407

Over the same period last year Tesla delivered 184800 electric vehicles and produced 180338 cars.

Model 3 and Model Y vehicles comprised 95% or 295324 of deliveries in the first quarter of 2022 according to Tesla.

The company produced 4641 fewer cars than it delivered during the quarter citing ""ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns.""

Analysts expected deliveries of 317000 vehicles for the first three months of 2022 according to estimates compiled by FactSet as of March 31. The estimates ranged from a low of 278000 vehicle deliveries to a high of 357000.

Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales numbers reported by Tesla.

The company recently opened a new factory in Brandenburg Germany and had a ribbon-cutting ceremony on March 22. Tesla also plans to host a grand opening and ""cyber rodeo"" event on April 7 at another new vehicle assembly plant it's building in Austin Texas.

A previous report from Reuters indicated that Tesla would resume production at the Shanghai plant on Monday April 4th as some stay-at-home orders were expected to end. However workers in the eastern portion of the city — where Tesla’s factory is located — are still facing COVID-related movement restrictions and there’s no word on when the city plans to lift them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMDIvYnVzaW5lc3MvdGVzbGEtc2FsZXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Unlike Other Carmakers Reports Big Sales Increase,"Tesla the world’s leading electric car company on Saturday reported a steep increase in worldwide sales in the first three months of the year as it overcame supply chain problems and moved closer to production levels on a par with established luxury carmakers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

Tesla said it delivered 310000 vehicles from January through March up from 185000 cars during the same period in 2021 roughly in line with Wall Street’s expectations. The nearly 70 percent increase was in contrast with major carmakers like General Motors and Toyota which reported big sales declines on Friday because of shortages of key components.

The increase in the first quarter builds on Tesla’s momentum from last year when it nearly doubled sales to just short of 1 million cars and overtook Volvo and Subaru. Tesla has coped better with an industrywide shortage of computer chips because its mastery of software allowed it to substitute chips that were available for ones that are scarce.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzdjM2Q2ZWIzLWNhMGItNDQ3NS05ZGE1LThlMzA0MTYyNzkxYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory means for its future in China,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

While not as ubiquitous as Atmel and the Arduino platform they can still be found in plenty of consumer electronics and reprogrammed and [Aaron] aka [atc1441] demonstrates how to modify them with an ESP32 as an intermediary.

Specifically the TI chips in this build revolve around the 8051-core microcontrollers which [Aaron] has found in small e-paper price tags and other RF hardware. He’s using an ESP32 to reprogram the TI chips and leveraging a web server on the ESP in order to be able to re-flash them over WiFi. Some of the e-paper displays have built-in header pins which makes connecting them to the ESP fairly easy and once that’s out of the way [Aaron] also provides an entire software library for interacting with these microcontrollers through the browser interface.

Right now the project supports the CC2430 CC2510 and CC1110 variants but [Aaron] plans to add support for more in the future. It’s a fairly comprehensive build and much better than buying the proprietary TI programmer so if you have some of these e-paper displays laying around the barrier to entry has been dramatically lowered. If you don’t have this specific type of display laying around we’ve seen similar teardowns and repurposing of other e-paper devices in the past as well.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbnJvZW5ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wNC8wMy9sb2NhbC1zdHVkZW50cy1jb21wZXRlLXN0YXRlLW1hdGhjb3VudHMtY29tcGV0aXRpb24vNzI0ODQwMzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local students compete at State MATHCOUNTS competition,"Monroe News Staff Report

Mason which is coached by teachers Carson Manthey and Tara Stubleski punched its ticket to the state competition by winning the Southeastern Chapter contest held in February. Mason's Joanne Cai took first as an individual in that competition while Spencer from HIS Homeschool took second.

Bedford was the winner of an additional virtual competition that was held later in February.

While no local individuals placed in the top ten Patrick Lewis MATHCOUNTS Southeastern Chapter Coordinator said that everyone had fun.

The MATHCOUNTS Foundation is a nationwide program that was founded in 1983 to promote excellence in mathematics. The program also extends beyond simply the competition series by supplementing regular classroom exercises with challenging real-world engineering-type problems.

More than 5000 schools typically participate nationwide in the competition series with another 2500 club schools also benefiting from program materials. The MATHCOUNTS program title sponsors are Raytheon Technologies and the U.S. Department of Defense and is also sponsored nationally by the National Society of Professional Engineers the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics CNA Foundation Northrop Grumman Foundation Texas Instruments the 3M Foundation and the Art of Problem Solving. Further information is available at www.mathcounts.org.

The competition consists of four rounds three written and one oral. In the Sprint Round students have 40 minutes to answer 30 questions without the aid of calculators. Target Round problems are multi-step and students have 6 minutes to answer each of 4 pairs. In the Team Round students have 20 minutes to answer 10 questions and must work as a team to reach mutually agreeable solutions.

The Countdown Round is a fast-paced oral round in which the top ten individuals based on the written portions square off for place standing and advancement to the State competition. Students are read a question which they have 60 seconds to answer. They must answer three questions correctly to advance to the next round.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9hdGxhbnRhL25hbWUvYnJpYW4tbW9ycm93LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM0MDI4MTE00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brian Morrow Obituary (1960 - 2022) - Atlanta GA - Atlanta Journal-Constitution,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/atlanta/name/brian-morrow-obituary?id=34028114 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9hdGxhbnRhL25hbWUvYnJpYW4tbW9ycm93LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM0MDI4MTE00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsYWNrZW5naW5lZXIuY29tL25ld3MvYm9laW5nLWVuZ2luZWVyLXdpbnMtYXdhcmQtZm9yLXByb2Zlc3Npb25hbC1hY2hpZXZlbWVudC1hdC1iZXlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing engineer wins award for professional achievement at BEYA,"Philip June received a Professional Achievement in Industry Award for excellence in his science technology engineering and math (STEM) career at this year’s Black Engineer of the Year Awards (BEYA). The honor was presented to Philip at the 36th annual BEYA Gala.







He joins a roster of outstanding professionals including Dixie Tyran Garr of Texas Instruments; W. T. Greer Jr. Motorola and Boeing exec Norma B. Clayton. She was a recipient of the BEYA for industry professional achievement in the year 2000.

“From his earliest days in the Boeing Company Philip June has stood out for his authentic people-focused leadership style” said Greg Hyslop chief engineer and executive vice president for Boeing’s engineering test and technology. “Now as vice president of Boeing global services safety and quality Philip oversees diverse teams across 88 locations worldwide. True to his passion for people and love of aerospace he remains deeply committed to developing the next generation of aerospace leaders who will change the world—working to build a diverse pipeline of talent for Boeing and mentoring more than 50 leaders engineers and students both inside and outside the company. His professional excellence equally matches Philip’s passion for people. His impressive fifteen-year career is marked by airplane development innovation and technical achievement to ensure the success of Boeing customers.”

Accepting the award Philip spoke about being raised in Stone Mountain Georgia at a time when upward mobility for Black Americans was all around him.

“Achievement and Black excellence were my constant inspirations” he continued. “So were parents’ sacrifices. My father rode the train into downtown Atlanta every day even though he had painful arthritis. My mother decided to forgo her career to stay at home to ensure that her children never missed a band baseball football or dance practice. I learned hard work perseverance and purpose from watching them sacrifice day in and day out. I work every day to be worthy of their extraordinary efforts and this award honors them” he said.

There's almost always something to look forward to from this multi-billion dollar engineering team. And yes these industries include helicopters. Built with the blessings of Bell Textron the makers of the Famous UH-1 Iroquois Subaru fully intends for their 412EPX to pull the brunt of the utility helicopter duties for the Japanese police and military.Its first prototype helicopter under the Subaru moniker and not the old Fuji brand will be the 412EPX. The latest evolution in a UH-1- Huey lineage that's already in use with the Japanese Police and Self Defense Force.It's important to remember that the American Bell 412 line of helicopters is already over 40 years old at this juncture itself a derivative of the Bell 212 which originated from the U.S. Military's Huey derived CH-135 ""Twin Huey.""So outside of a shiny new coat of paint what's this Subaru manufactured example got that its American counterpart doesn't? As it happens the answer needs to be explained in sections.Starting with a brief historical recap Subaru and Bell Textron have been on and off working partners since the early 1960s. Back when the original Bell UH-1 Iriquois helicopter was flying over Vietnam Subaru under the Fuji Heavy Industry moniker was among the first to license-build Bell helicopters overseas.One of the very first the Fuji-Bell 204B looked nearly identical to the American helicopter it was devised from. By 1995 the upgraded Fuji-Bell 205B was flying with the Japanese Civil Aviation Bureau (Ministry of Transportation). Moving into the 21st century the next phase of the Fuji-Bell program was ready to take shape by the mid-2010s. Now under the same Subaru branding used with their passenger cars.Work began on what we now call the Subaru 412EPX in at least 2014 and likely well before with Subaru's official press release for the project coming in September 2015. The new helicopter is purpose-built for use with the Japanese Self Defense Forces as a utility chopper.Powering this Japanese-American beast is a single electrically controlled Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6T Twin-Pac turboshaft engine with 11% more torque on offer over the normal Bell 412 thanks to an improved transmission. It's the same engine that powers the American AH-1Z Super Cobra and the Navalized AH-1J SeaCobra.Safe to say it's more than robust enough for non-combat operations. Or even light troop transport if the need arises. Inside the cockpit the second generation of Bell's Basi-Pro glass display system enveloped the dashboard in a sea of clear crips liquid crystal panels that integrate all the operations of the aircraft into four large screens.It incorporates a Garmin GTN-750 NAV/COM/GPS with high-resolution digital maps a downside better than what you get with Apple Maps. The system is also synced to the helicopter's autopilot system allowing for a certain level of autonomous operation. Loaded to around 10500 pounds (4762.71 kg) including its own weight Subaru-Bell reckons it can hover at a maximum altitude of between 13 and 15000 feet (4572 meters).A fascinating new feature on the 412EPX is the integrated ""Fast Fin"" located at the rear of the aircraft. This stabilizing element in close proximity to the tail rotor improves airflow around the tail boom and vertical fin. So just in case the 412EPX needs to escape in a hurry there shouldn't be any issues maneuvering away from danger.Inside the cabin there are three options for a seating arrangement of 13 two of which come at no extra cost to the operator. These two include a Fabric covered folding seat variant with individual seat belts and a single strap shoulder harness. The other is Nylon covered bench seating arranged with one row of four rearward facing seats behind the crew one row of five forward-facing seats and two outward-facing benches.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3RoZWF2aWF0aW9uZ2Vla2NsdWIuY29tL2N6ZWNoLXJlcHVibGljLXdhbnRzLXRvLWJ1eS1tb3JlLXVoLTF5LWFuZC1haC0xei1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1hcy1hLWNvbnNlcXVlbmNlLW9mLXRoZS13YXItaW4tdWtyYWluZS_SAYQBaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVhdmlhdGlvbmdlZWtjbHViLmNvbS9jemVjaC1yZXB1YmxpYy13YW50cy10by1idXktbW9yZS11aC0xeS1hbmQtYWgtMXotaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtYXMtYS1jb25zZXF1ZW5jZS1vZi10aGUtd2FyLWluLXVrcmFpbmUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Czech Republic wants to buy more UH-1Y and AH-1Z helicopters as a consequence of the War in Ukraine,"Share this article

The war in Ukraine has made the Czech government think twice about its procurement of the Bell UH-1Y and AH-1Z helicopters.

The war in Ukraine has made the Czech government think twice about its procurement of the Bell UH-1Y and AH-1Z helicopters Alert 5 reports.

The local government is now thinking of buying more helicopters as the four AH-1Z and eight UH-1Y helicopters that were ordered is now deemed insufficient to meet the country’s defense needs.

Bell Textron has started production of the first AH-1Z Viper for the Czech Republic at Bell’s Amarillo Assembly Center the company said in a news release on Feb. 23. The production of the Viper joins UH-1Y production as part of the Czech Republic Foreign Military Sale (FMS) of mixed fleet aircraft.

“Bell understands what it means to execute a successful international program” said Mike Deslatte vice president and H-1 program director Bell. “We understand the importance of providing the unmatched capability of the H-1 aircraft to our customers. Bell remains focused on producing exceptional combat aircraft and providing modern capabilities for the Czech Air Force as a partner in the H-1 program along with the U.S. Government.”

Bell’s work beyond aircraft manufacturing includes building a flight training device for the Czech Republic essential to integrating the new helicopters into the Czech Armed Forces.

Bell began production on the Czech Republic UH-1Y in 2021 marking the first production for an international operator of the UH-1Y. The Czech Republic’s purchase of both the AH-1Z and UH-1Y takes full advantage of the 85 percent commonality between parts and enabling full mission capabilities between both aircraft.

The commonality between the aircraft enabled critical component supply chains to remain active during AH-1Z production for the USMC.

The Venom and the Viper are based on the Vietnam-era family of Huey helicopters the UH-1 Iroquois and the derivative AH-1 Cobra.

In addition to the Czech Republic Bell is actively producing AH-1Zs for the US Marines Corps and the Kingdom of Bahrain. In total the H-1 program is on track to produce 217 AH-1Zs and 168 UH-1Ys with more than 100 consecutive H-1s delivered on time for the USMC and FMS customers.

Rumes 300 UUV

The original developer of Remus 300 is the Norwegian company Hydroid which in 2020 was acquired by Huntington Ingalls Industries and thus became a subsidiary of HII. Initially Remus 300 was developed as a civilian commercial product later the military found another application – intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance [ISR].

The US Navy will use Remus 300 for its intended purpose – intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance mine action search and recovery marine archeology hydrographic commissioning anti-submarine warfare and more.

Remus 300 has an integrated unmanned marine autonomous architecture which will allow easier updating or adding new solutions in the future. The drone weighs 56 kg but this is a standard size. Depending on the mission the drone can be reconfigured and change its weight – from 45 to 67 kg. The operational depth to which the drone can dive is 305 meters.

Remus 300 has dual-frequency sonar with a resolution of up to 5 cm NBOSI conductivity and temperature sensor [CT] and depth sensor TE Connectivity. Additionally there are integrated other sensors and devices such as a 2G Robotics 4K HD camera with a high-intensity LED light strip a Seabird Scientific Eco Puck Triplet environmental sensor and a Klein MA-X sonar that fills the gaps.

The drone has an integrated commercial and military navigation system iXblue Phins C3 [INS] as well as a commercial or optional military system for global positioning Garmin [GPS]. It is powered by a DC brushless motor and has a blade for tilt and tilt control. Depending on the battery it can last underwater for 10 20 or 30 hours. The recharging time for lithium-ion batteries is between 12 and 18 hours.

The Cancer Genome Atlas Project performed next generation sequencing on 331 primary and metastatic melanomas. Mutations in PPP6C were identified in 7% (n = 24) of tumors sequenced. Of those 36% (n = 9) harbored a R264C mutation. PPP6C(R264C) co-occurred with both BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61K) mutations5. We further analyzed PPP6C mutation data from 48000 tumors across 184 pan-cancer studies. This analysis reveals that PPP6C mutations were identified in 285 tumors. Overall 22% (n = 58) of PPP6C-mutated tumors contained the hot-spot PPP6C(R264C) mutation. All but one of these tumors containing a PPP6C(R264C) mutation were melanomas suggesting a unique requirement for PPP6C in melanocytes (Fig. 1A). PPP6C appears to be the only recurrently mutated serine threonine phosphatase across all human cancers20 suggesting it plays an important role in melanoma regulation.

We leveraged publicly available CRISPR loss of function screens across a diverse array of human primary and immortalized cell lines to investigate the requirements for PPP6C in proliferation21. Melanoma cell lines are uniquely dependent on PPP6C expression for proliferation (Fig. 1B). Based on this data we suspected a unique relationship between PPP6C and the melanocyte lineage. MITF is the critical transcriptional regulator of melanocyte development and upregulates a set of genes to drive differentiation1112. In order to explore whether there was a link between the transcriptional program of MITF and PPP6C we investigated 42 publicly available melanoma cell lines from the Broad Institute22. Our analysis reveals that PPP6C expression negatively correlates with MITF target gene expression (Fig. 1C). These findings suggest that PPP6C may play a previously unexamined role in MITF regulation in the melanocyte lineage.

PPP6C disrupts melanocyte differentiation in vivo

In order to investigate whether PPP6C regulates MITF in vivo we utilized genetic approaches in zebrafish. Using CRISPR we performed targeted disruption of the PPP6C coding sequence in wild-type embryos. Targeted disruption of ppp6c led to embryonic lethality at 24 h post fertilization (Supplemental Fig. 1). This is consistent with prior research in mice showing the requirement of PPP6C for post implantation embryogenesis8. In order to study PPP6C specifically in the melanocyte compartment expression via the MiniCoopR vector was used. The tol2 transposon-based MiniCoopR vector was used to express the human orthologue of PPP6C as well as the zebrafish orthologue of MITF (mitfa) open reading frame under control of the mitfa promoter (as described in Iyengar et al.23). The resulting vector was then injected into 1 cell stage embryos containing a mutation in mitfa24. Therefore only fish in which the vector was successfully incorporated underwent melanocyte differentiation allowing us to examine the effects of PPP6C expression in melanocytes. Vectors encoding PPP6C PPP6C(R264C) and GFP (control) were created (referred to as MC-PPP6C etc.). Expression of PPP6C reduced the number of melanocytes on 5 day old fish as compared to GFP controls (Fig. 2AB). Expression of PPP6C(R264C) further reduced the number of melanocytes. These fish were assayed for mitfa and target gene expression. While neural crest markers were unaffected mitfa and mitfa target gene expression was reduced in fish expressing PPP6C and further reduced in fish expressing PPP6C(R264C) (Fig. 2CD). These results indicate that in vivo expression of PPP6C affects melanocyte differentiation and results in a phenotype of fewer melanocytes.

Prior research has shown that regulation of the phosphorylation status of MITF is important for its expression and activity as different transcriptional programs are upregulated based on MITF levels. Phosphorylated MITF regulated in part by KIT-mediated phosphorylation is active increases its own expression and upregulates a transcriptional program of melanocyte differentiation1625. With this in mind we hypothesized that there was an interaction between PPP6C and Mitfa and used genetic approaches in zebrafish to test this hypothesis. Prior loss of function research has shown the serine residues S69 and S73 on MITF play a role in melanocyte differentiation142526. These two residues are conserved in the zebrafish orthologue as S8 and S12 (Fig. 3A). We performed site-directed mutagenesis on the mitfa open reading frame to selectively mutate S8 and S12 to phosphomimetic aspartic acid residues (hereafter referred to as “mitfa(S8DS12D)”). Injection of vectors containing mitfa(S8DS12D) mutations resulted in a rescue of melanocyte number in fish expressing PPP6C or PPP6C(R264C) (Fig. 3BC). At the molecular level introduction of a phosphomimetic S8DS12D mitfa also rescues mitfa and mitfa target gene expression (Fig. 3DE). Together these experiments indicate that PPP6C impacts Mitf phosphorylation during differentiation and the R264C mutation has an impact on melanocyte differentiation27.

MITF promoter activity is reduced under expression of PPP6C(WT) and PPP6C(R264C)

In order to directly study the effect of PPP6C on mitfa gene expression we developed a reporter gene assay in transgenic zebrafish embryos. MITF is able to transactivate its own promoter and participates in a positive feedback loop to maintain expression2829. To measure mitfa promoter activity we utilized the MiniCoopR encoding GFP. MiniCoopR vectors containing GFP and either PPP6C(WT) or PPP6C(R264C) were injected into fish containing albino and mitfa mutations resulting in fluorescent and pigment less melanocytes (Fig. 4). Melanocytes were imaged and fluorescent intensity was quantified to measure mitfa promoter activity. The effects of PPP6C on mitfa promoter activity were measured first on a non-oncogenic background. As compared to GFP controls embryos containing either PPP6C(WT) or PPP6C(R264C) showed reduced GFP signal consistent with reduced mitfa promoter activity (Fig. 4A). Next we sought to determine if this reduced activity was consistent on both the BRAF and NRAS oncogenic backgrounds. Regardless of oncogenic background melanocytes expressing PPP6C(WT) had reduced GFP expression and mitfa promoter activity (Fig. 4BC). Additionally embryos containing PPP6C(R264C) showed a further reduction in GFP expression and mitfa promoter activity. This data demonstrates that PPP6C has an effect on mitfa promoter activity in vivo consistent with a negative effect on mitfa transcriptional activity. Additionally the melanoma-specific oncogenic mutant PPP6C(R264C) led to a further reduction in expression of mitfa:GFP in vivo suggesting that R264C is a gain of function mutation.

The recurrent R264C mutation confers a gain of function proliferation phenotype in melanoma

We sought to determine the impact the R264C mutation has on cellular proliferation and tumor onset in a melanoma model since low MITF expression has been shown to be oncogenic in a subset of melanomas1718 and promotes tumor initiation in cultured melanoma cell lines30. Fish were injected with a vector co-expressing NRAS(Q61K) and either PPP6C(WT) or PPP6C(R264C). At 3 days and 5 days post fertilization the number of melanocytes on the head of the fish were counted (Fig. 5A). The percentage change in number of melanocytes between days was calculated. PPP6C(R264C) led to a significant increase in melanocyte proliferation as compared to expression of PPP6C(WT) (Fig. 5B). Zebrafish expressing PPP6C(R264C) and NRAS(Q61K) developed tumors significantly faster than those injected with wildtype PPP6C and NRAS(Q61K) (Fig. 5C). Together this data points to the role of PPP6C as a modulator of mitfa expression and suggests that expression of PPP6C(R264C) enhances melanoma initiation on an NRAS(Q61K) background.

PPP6C expression affects MITF in melanoma

After observing that mitfa transcriptional activity is negatively affected by PPP6C expression we sought to identify the changes that might occur when PPP6C expression is reduced in an MITF-low melanoma. We hypothesized that genetic inactivation of PPP6C would lead to higher levels of MITF and promote a more differentiated cellular state. In order to test this hypothesis we employed the A375 melanoma cell line which expresses very low levels of MITF31. Cells were transfected with an siRNA against PPP6C to reduce gene expression (Fig. 6A). MITF and MITF target gene expression was assayed. PPP6C knockdown increased MITF and MITF target gene expression significantly (Fig. 6B). Additionally we measured the effect PPP6C expression has on drug sensitivity. A375 cells were treated with dabrafenib a small molecule inhibitor of BRAF(V600E)32 and knockdown of PPP6C was performed (Fig. 6C). Cells treated only with dabrafenib or with a non-targeting siRNA displayed a robust response to treatment (EC50 = 0.3 nM). By comparison cells treated with PPP6C siRNA showed a 15-fold decrease in sensitivity (EC50 = 4.6 nM). This data indicates PPP6C is able to modulate expression levels of MITF and induce drug resistance in a BRAF(V600E) mutant human melanoma cell line. Finally we examined MITF expression and phosphorylation after PPP6C knockdown. We find no significant change in MITF protein expression as determined by confocal microscopy after immunofluorescent staining after PPP6C knockdown (Fig. 6D). We do find an increase in phospho-MITF as measured by confocal microscopy after immunofluorescent staining of cells treated with PPP6C siRNA (Fig. 6E).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoYXJtdGVjaC5jb20vdmlldy9icmVha2luZy10aHJvdWdoLWJhcnJpZXJzLXRvLWNvbnRpbnVvdXMtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Breaking Through Barriers to Continuous Manufacturing,"Pharmaceutical manufacturing is inching towards implementing more efficient and sustainable processes including continuous manufacturing (CM) of solid-dosage drugs. Advantages of CM include the potential for faster development easier technical transfer and more efficient and flexible commercial production with tighter process control. Although early adopters have realized benefits and suppliers continue to improve the equipment and systems used in CM (1) some barriers to broader industry adoption remain. A collaborative effort between industry regulators academia and other stakeholders is driving slow progress toward overcoming these hurdles.

The success of the cooperation between government and the private sector to rapidly develop and build capacity for vaccines and treatments to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of what is possible in the normally slow-acting and risk-averse pharmaceutical sector say industry experts. They hope to see a similar boost to the uptake of advanced manufacturing technologies such as CM.

Reducing barriers to CM

One positive sign is greater acceptance of public-private partnerships by FDA and the US Congress due to the successes demonstrated during the pandemic response said Jennifer Luray vice-president of strategy and communications at Research!America during a panel discussion hosted by the US Pharmacopeia Convention (USP) (2). This openness may help partnerships seeking government funding.

Another factor demonstrated during the pandemic was that the alignment of regulators and industry on the need for speed-to-market acted to lower the barrier to using new technologies. The challenge during “normal” times is to continue this agreement.

“Regulators and industry are aligned in their desire to create safe and effective medicines but there is often a misalignment because industry is also concerned about the risks to development costs and speed-to-market” said Kelley Rogers technical program director for Biosciences within the Material Measurements Laboratory at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) during the USP discussion (2). If government can do more to take into account these business concerns it will help “de-risk” adoption of new technologies.

“Adoption of CM can be accelerated considerably if policy makers introduce financial incentives and regulatory incentives” suggests Moheb Nasr principal at Nasr Pharma Regulatory Consulting and Pharmaceutical TechnologyEditorial Advisory Board member. These could include tax breaks expedited approval or exclusivity periods for example Nasr and his colleagues suggested in a 2019 article (3).

Generic-drug manufacturers recognize the need to innovate but justifying the cost of investing in CM is even more challenging for them said Lisa Parks vice-president of Sciences and Regulatory Affairs at the Association for Accessible Medicines (2). “For any company to make a business case regardless of whether they are an innovator or generic they need to assess the technology to gauge the appropriateness and value add of the investment” she explains. “They need to consider whether the technology has the capability to lower manufacturing cost or meaningfully increase quality. We’ve heard that CM can increase quality by tightening specifications but we need to better understand how this actually affects quality. We need to be asking: Does adopting CM for a particular product improve the clinical outcome for the patient in terms of safety or efficacy? Does the adoption of CM create unintended barriers for generic entry?”

Other barriers mentioned frequently in relation to CM are regulatory uncertainty and potential differences between regional authorities. The draft version of the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Q13 guidance on continuous manufacturing published in July 2021 (4) helps alleviate some of this concern by providing a harmonized guideline supported by the regulatory members of ICH which include FDA the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and many others.

“Many health authorities are very supportive of CM but many do not have much experience and their requirements are not always clear” says Lawrence De Belder executive consultant at Pharmatech Associates a USP company. “This uncertainty is a hurdle because companies are concerned that while a product made with CM might be approved by most countries globally there might be a few countries that would require additional data or process changes. ICH Q13 is a good step in the right direction with an agreement or suggestion on a number of aspects but it is not yet a full harmonization.”

Dennis Hall vice-president of manufacturing services at USP said that one of USP's goals is to help develop more regulatory clarity by exploring the possibility of developing standards for CM (2). First however USP is working with manufacturers to develop methods specific to products made in the CM environment. In addition Pharmatech Associates acquired by USP in 2021 (5) is helping industry to evaluate how they might use CM. USP can help fill the gap that exists in access to knowledge experience and laboratory capabilities for PAT model development and process development adds De Belder.

“Implementing advanced manufacturing [including CM] is knowledge intensive. To make this happen we need to make knowledge and technology available at a low entry cost” said Fernando Muzzio distinguished professor of chemical and biochemical engineering at Rutgers University and Pharmaceutical Technology Editorial Advisory Board member in a PharmTech podcast (6).

Investment cost for CM equipment is currently a barrier to wider use of CM in the industry partly because in some business cases CM equipment is competing with batch equipment that is already in place adds De Belder. In addition equipment needs to be more flexible. “If you could buy a CM line for one product knowing that you could adapt it easily for other products in the future it would lower the investment cost” he explains.

Although some advances in modularity and integration have been made (1) more of these features in equipment designs are crucial for allowing greater flexibility in production “Having interchangeable unit operations would be helpful so that if something changes in the future a manufacturer can more easily make a change. To make this easier equipment designs need to be modular and interfaces need to be standardized” says De Belder.

“Production systems that are more modular and flexible to implement than currently available offerings from vendors would be attractive” agrees Gregory Connelly senior director at Vertex. “Such systems should be able to leverage the processing benefits that CM affords (i.e. blending at small scale to ensure robust blend uniformity) while being easily adaptable to various pharmaceutical profiles such as dose tablet weight product demand and also material tracking requirements.”

Improving operations

Early adopters of CM are reaping benefits and at the same time continuing to improve CM processes and operating procedures. Vertex for example has three approved products made using CM technology with the first approved by FDA in 2015. “The biggest benefit we have realized for our portfolio is the ability to advance more quickly through late-stage development” says Connelly. To provide more space for development the company is considering expanding its CM capabilities with additional platforms that can offer more modularity and flexibility for both development work and commercial production. For now the company is using one qualified line for production that will soon be joined by a second line at a contract manufacturer. One of the challenges has been the effort required to convert a CM line from one product to another. Vertex has reduced this change-of-line burden through use of a digital tool that guides operators through the complex process of disassembly and cleaning. “Programs such as Tulip] which among other capabilities provides a platform for organizing video clips showing proper assembly/disassembly procedures are a huge advance over paper-based standard operating procedures [SOPs] or even digital versions of static documents” says Connelly.

Innovation in process analytical technology (PAT) tools and growing experience in how they are best used are also key to improving CM processes. “In the early years of CM development we thought to use PAT to measure as much as possible sometimes even with redundant measurements” says De Belder. “In process development using a lot of PAT is beneficial for helping you understand the process. In commercial manufacturing today however PAT is being used more judiciously because it is resource-intensive to create and maintain PAT models. Manufacturers are performing risk analyses to see where PAT is really needed on commercial lines for the process control strategy.”",,,,,,

The career paths of eight former CEOs summarized below suggest that these executives regularly find a new role in the banking industry — often as a board member or as the chief executive of another bank.

Jacolby Shelton is a three-time Big 12 champion in the sprints and if Saturday is any indication he's only getting better.

The Texas Tech junior from Pearland Dawson ran a personal-record 20.47 seconds in the 200 meters at the Masked Rider Open good for second place. Shelton ran the time with legal wind of 1.9 meters per second and tentatively moved to fifth place in NCAA Division I this season pending results from meets elsewhere this weekend.

All three of Shelton's individual Big 12 titles — the 60 meters and the 200 this year and the 60 last year — have come at the conference indoor championships.

French sprinter Amaury Golitin won the 200 in Saturday's competition at the Fuller Track Complex in 20.42.

The Masked Rider Open was the Red Raiders' first home outdoor meet of the season.

Like Shelton Tech's Onaara Obamuwagun took second in an event but moved into the top 10 in NCAA Division I this season. Obamuwagun went 43 feet 9 1/4 inches in the women's triple jump tentatively seventh in Division I depending on results from meets elsewhere this weekend. Her performance also came in legal wind conditions of 0.6 meters per second.

During the indoor season Obamuwagun went 44-0. She achieved second-team all-America status with an 11th-place finish at the NCAA championships with a mark of 43-3 1/4.

When scanned the card will tell the bus driver who the student is and where to drop them off. Previously the bus driver would manually input into a device when a student got on or off the bus. But now with the students using a card officials say the process is easier and safer.

“They are all asking when they can use it” said Thompson the transportation director for Regional School Unit 38.

Wayne Elementary School has become the first school in the district to receive their key cards. The district plans to give the key cards out to every school in the district but is doing it on a day-to-day basis so Thompson and her staff can give a presentation on what to do.

The technology originally was installed on the school buses to contact-trace students during the COVID-19 pandemic according to Superintendent Jay Charette. But even after school districts stopped having to contact trace on public transportation the technology proved to still be extremely helpful mainly around student safety and to help solve problems around the bus driver shortage.

“With COVID-19 we really needed to find a way to know who was on the bus and for how long and the protocols related to that” said Charette. “We really started looking and saying ‘This is COVID-19 related but what are the advantages to this system?’ Being able to know who is on the bus what seat they are in and the ability to know when a student is going to be picked up or dropped off it’s a very win-win situation and we felt it keeps everyone involved in the transportation process.”

With an iPad-like device installed on the buses to access the software school officials and those in the transportation department can pull a report of who rode on a bus when they were on the bus and the duration in which they were on the bus — important factors when determining close contacts to a COVID-19 case.

The technology called Traversa and made by Plano Texas-based Tyler Technology has several different features in addition to tracking students. With the device bus drivers have to do pre- and post-route inspections on the bus and check for maintenance issues. The device will track the speed of drivers and will only be able to work while the driver is stopped.

It costs the Maranacook school district about $5500 a year for the subscription to Traversa according to expenses listed in its budget for next year.

With the student’s key card the device can tell who is on the bus and who is not — if a student is not on the bus that day the device can reroute and skip the students’ stop. If the device reroutes it will do so only on main roads and ensure the child can still leave the bus on the correct side of their stop.

With Tyler 360 another subsection of the technology that RSU 38 will roll out soon parents can see through a smartphone app their child made it on the bus got off the bus and when the bus is expected to arrive. Transportation directors can alert the parents of news regarding the buses too.

According to CJ Vose Tyler Technology’s director of sales for student transportation 26000 customers in more than 48 states use the bus routing system which roughly covers 33% of students nationally.

In the Augusta area Hallowell-based Regional School Unit 2 has already been using the system. Transportation Director Katie Spear said in the February school board business meeting the technology was a “huge help” with COVID-19 contact-tracing or if “for some reason someone’s child does not make it home.”

The Maine Department of Education did not immediately respond for comments this past week regarding statewide trends with bus routing technology.

When talks of installing the technology on the school buses first became a topic back in September at RSU 38’s school board meeting board member Dane Wing raised concerns over safety and whether or not someone could hack into the system or if parent’s access to the bus route could be worrisome. Thompson clarified at the meeting that the smartphone app does not allow parents to see the route the bus is on but rather the time when their student will arrive at their specific stop.

Tyler Technology’s media relation’s specialist Jennifer Kepler elaborated on the safety of the technology saying all data coming in and out of the Tyler data centers are monitored and recorded.

“Tyler’s Student Transportation solution is provided as a software-as-a-service solution meaning a district does not need to own update or safeguard computer hardware on-site” she said. “Instead Tyler hosts client’s data within its data centers. … All student data is encrypted in their software solutions and Tyler Drive tablets.”

Vose pointed out the technology can be helpful to combat the bus driver shortage as well since the routes can be modified in real time depending on who is on the bus. RSU 38 has done relatively well compared to other districts regarding the bus driver shortage but there has been times where routes have had to change or a bus did not run.

“It helps in being efficient with routes” Vose said. “There might not be the same amount of drivers (in a district) or less buses but the same amount of children. It helps to be more efficient with routes with giving information to drivers that might be new or if they might not have drivers familiar with the student’s drop off locations.”

Thompson said the children have acclimated well to using the key cards to scan onto the bus and were engaged on Thursday when they received the cards.

Though the children have acclimated well to the technology Thompson said she has trained her staff “in little itty steps” so they are able to take it on at a pace rather than all at once. She gave the example of logging on the device one day then changing the bus route the next day as some of her lessons.

“They were reluctant since it’s so new and very different but they have proven to be the people they are which is pretty darn amazing and they have embraced it” Thompson said of her drivers. “… They understood the ‘why’ what the ‘why’ was and that we had to buy in because of the ‘why’ but they have all done a good job on being open minded.”

But at heart she's still a teacher who wants every student to have a chance to get a good public-school education and take what they've learned to excel in life.

And as the first Black female board president of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock Alumni Association Cummings -- who as a young child was labeled ""at risk"" by school officials -- hopes to use her influence to bring local students and the university together to help ensure bright futures for the former.

""I've learned a lot over the course of these years ... being a member of the board"" says Cummings for whom this is the sixth year.

The association is responsible for awarding some $100000 in scholarships each year. ""Being able to support scholarships which was my passion has been an experience that ... I treasure"" says Cummings who's on the board scholarship committee. Reading students' scholarship applications and hearing their stories ""is something that you don't forget easily.""

Definitely not something to be forgotten easily by someone who serves as director of assessment and accountability for the Little Rock School District. In her role Cummings oversees local state and national assessments for the district leading evaluations and approving research endeavors.

UALR believed in and supported her Cummings says and she'd like to see it do so for college-bound Central Arkansas students by way of relational capital.

""I would like for this university to partner with the local school districts"" she says. ""This university sits smack dab in the middle of [the] Little Rock School District Pulaski County [Special] School District and then you have North Little Rock right here. ... To me there is no reason why there can't be a tight connection even a tight pipeline from schools to the university.""

She'd like to see the university put an initiative in place specifically for area students one that would bring students to see UALR as one of the first post secondary options to them.

Ideally she continues students in the districts would know university representatives by name and see UALR ""as a viable option for themselves.""

These desires reflect Cummings' shrewd practicality combined with her passion for seeing young people reach their full potential.

""Professionally she is a teacher at heart"" says Katrina Owoh Cummings' friend sorority sister and former alumni board member. ""Even though she is now on the administrative level she has never lost sight of providing students the very best educational experience.

""Her intellectual ability to learn subject matter provide sound reasoning and gain knowledge and understanding to share with others is a gift"" Owoh continues. ""She is confident in who she is and her purpose in life. Her passion to educate all students and make a difference is a commitment that runs deep within her.""

Cummings would attest that her lessons on commitment came from her parents Lawrence and Easter Crutchfield. Through them she learned that ""being the best that I could be was important to my success.""

She also learned a strong work ethic from her mother who was a domestic worker; and her father who worked his way from janitor to supervisor at Tyson Foods in North Little Rock.

""They believed that whatever you chose to do you should be the best at it"" Cummings says. And through them she adds ""I came to know that prayer changes things.""

A LARGE BROOD

Cummings is the 12th of 15 children.

""We didn't have a lot of money growing up but I didn't know it"" she says. Her mother -- a niece of the late noted Governor's Mansion cook Liza Ashley -- was an excellent cook herself. ""Mom could make anything out of nothing"" Cummings says.

What the Crutchfield children lacked in money they made up for in love ... and imagination. Among other activities they spent their play time singing and dancing even going so far as write produce and perform their own stage productions.

Cummings was a Little Rock School District student through her sophomore year at Little Rock Central High. When her father retired and moved the family outside the city she finished her high-school education at Mills University Studies High School in the Pulaski County Special School District. After graduation she headed to UALR on a full scholarship.

As an undergraduate student she excelled. She was chosen as a Writing Center tutor and as a Ronald E. McNair Scholar a role by which she presented original research across the country. She was chosen as a Student Government Association senator for her college. And she became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc.'s Epsilon Phi Chapter.

Except for the doctorate in educational leadership that she earned from the University of Arkansas Fayelleville all Cummings' post secondary education has been at UALR. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in English literature she earned a master's degree in secondary education with an emphasis on special education and assessments.

It wasn't until her sophomore year at UALR that she decided to become an educator.

""I always loved English and had some pretty great English teachers"" she says. ""I also learned that I could major in English literature and still go into other career fields."" A couple of her professors told her they thought she'd be a great English professor.

Then her role as an AmeriCorps volunteer took her to Baseline Elementary School in southwest Little Rock where she tutored students and worked with ""a very skilled teacher"" -- Lucille Mothershed related to Little Rock Nine member Thelma Mothershed-Wair. This experience led Cummings to realize that her calling would involve molding students in the K-12 realm rather than at the college level.

She went on to teach regular pre-advanced placement and advanced placement English at J.A. Fair High School. The school she says ""was filled with some of the brightest students and I was blessed to teach many gifted truly intelligent young people who are doing great things.""

LEAVING NO CHILD BEHIND

Cummings thinks back to being labeled ""at-risk"" in school -- not because of her grades; she was a ""strong"" student who enjoyed school -- ""but because I came from a large family and we didn't have a lot of money."" When she heard the term she didn't know what it meant. ""No one ever explained to me no one ever explained it to my parents.

""I think that it's important for parents to know what's happening with their children's education and I think that every student deserves an opportunity to experience their education on their best terms ... I think that equity is not equal but equity is fair. And all students deserve the best shot possible to be successful.""

So as an educator Cummings dedicated herself to making sure otherwise marginalized children got the piece of educational pie due them and has helped parents to make sure their children did so. This along with her work as an advocate for students with disabilities helped to earn her the title of Teacher of the Year in 2003.

But her career took a turn when the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was signed into law.

The state of Arkansas partnered with the Southern Regional Education Board to help improve education in its schools through their High Schools That Work reform model. Cummings was chosen as the High Schools that Work Coordinator for J.A. Fair.

""It was really a good experience. And that was something I was proud of that came out of some of that reform -- getting students engaged and getting them to see how learning affects them.""

FROM CLASSROOM TO OFFICE

Cummings eventually switched gears again when she became interim assistant principal at Fair. The new job took her directly into the realm of student discipline and how to manage it long-term.

""I did have to change my mindset because ... I had been in the classroom and then I did work in curriculum with reform but I had to deal a lot with discipline"" she says. ""What I learned about me in that position is that my beliefs about discipline sometimes differed from what the policy was."" Cummings didn't understand why school policy mandated such punishments as for instance suspensions for chronic tardiness. ""This was not a solution to what clearly was a surface problem with underlying root causes."" The bright side: her principal along with her assistant-principal colleague came up with more ""creative"" ways to work with students in such situations.

Her next career stop: becoming coordinator of testing then within a year director of testing for the Little Rock School District before taking on her current role. She went ""from thinking about what was good for my students in the classroom to what was good for my students in my building to what was good for my students in my district.""

She'd learned from her earlier roles that testing could be scary for everybody even teachers.

""What I wanted to do was ... change that mindset. Testing doesn't have to be scary if we understand number one why we're doing it and then we understand the data that's coming from it that is meant to help."" And helping people become comfortable with assessments -- comfortable understanding their data what that data says about them and how they could use that data to improve -- is something she enjoys doing.

In addition to her 9-to-5 job Cummings owns a business The Strengthening Group LLC by which she helps individuals and entities reach their potential by offering such services as speaking engagements coaching and consulting. She has worked with churches colleges social groups companies and local- government departments as well as with families.

Little Rock School District Superintendent Michael Poore refers to Cummings as ""an exceptional woman.""

""She's a very unusual person in the sense that a lot of times folks that are so skilled and in some ways a psychometrician a data person ... sometimes are not individuals that are very social"" Poore notes. ""That's such an opposite of Danyelle. She is a person that has an amazing background in terms of looking at data and doing analytics ... but she also is a very warm and caring person that reaches out into our community in so many different ways. That happens through her sorority that happens through the university and through the school district itself.""

TIME TALENT TREASURE

And Cummings' dedication to her community has been as striking as her dedication to the students in the school district. The member of Little Rock's St. Mark Baptist Church quotes that famous phrase in Luke 12:48 in the New Testament -- ""'to whom much was given of him much will be required'"" -- and her parents' admonition: ""'If you got it to give then you need to give it.'""

A graduate of the Little Rock Chamber Leadership Greater Little Rock Class XXIX Cummings served as curriculum chairwoman for Class XXXIV and chairman for Class XXXV. And she has stayed active with Alpha Kappa Alpha. She's now a member of the sorority's local alumnae chapter Beta Pi Omega.

One project that was near and dear to Cummings' heart was Alpha Kappa Alpha's former international signature youth program ASCEND (Achievement Self-Awareness Communication Engagement Networking and Developmental Skills) which ""was like a small school dedicated to supporting the whole student"" she explains. She coordinated the program which over three and a half years reached 217 students and graduated more than 160 students.

Also among Cummings' volunteer activities is her role on the board of the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame which annually inducts notable people with Arkansas ties living and deceased. Black Hall of Fame chairman Charles Stewart recruited Cummings for the board in 2014 after she was identified as someone who'd be fit to lead the hall's Distinguished Laureate Lecture Series. Cummings has chaired the series since 2014.

Stewart has found Cummings ""to be collegial intellectually curious organized and an excellent communicator.""

""Danyell has mastered the art of being able to walk with and work with the powerful and has not lost the common touch"" he says. ""She has humility and pride in her upbringing ... and used it to develop the tenacity and fortitude that has allowed her to navigate many obstacles to achieve success.""

MOM TO THREE

Family life is important to Cummings too. She's mother to college students Rodney 21 and Rahji 18; and high-school student Ramsey 16.

Tjuana Byrd Manning local lawyer former president of the Women's Foundation of Arkansas and also a sorority sister notes that Cummings seems to have achieved ""the work-life balance challenge that so many women face."" Byrd Manning who describes Cummings as ""a phenomenal mother"" remembers the boys' younger days when Cummings ""was also serving the community through our sorority and her other civic organizations while working to obtain her Ph.D.""

""She continues to fulfill her responsibilities to her family to her work and to her volunteer leadership and service with excellence.""

That ""work-life balance"" Cummings maintains today includes spending her free time climbing Pinnacle Mountain with her sons; reading; traveling -- and gardening a hobby the pandemic brought out. She also enjoys painting -- ""and resting"" she adds. Finding time for that rest must be a challenge; it's obvious that Cummings is a woman who wears many hats.

Under the hat she dons as UALR Alumni board present she says she hopes to see an increase in alumni association membership. Yearly membership dues range from $20 for those who graduated within the last three years to $40; a lifetime membership is $750.

""I'm asking all graduates and even those who graduated from other universities but would like to support this community of students to become a member of the alumni association.""

This was a surprising announcement and there wasn’t a reason given as to why the card is being discontinued. There was also no word as to what’s happening with existing business cards. The Radisson Rewards Business Card is being converted to the US Bank Triple Business Rewards.

The Radisson Rewards Visa is getting buried in May

Key Details

The Radisson Rewards Visa’s 40000 Radisson Rewards points anniversary bonus will be discontinued as of April 30 2022.

Only spending through April 30th will qualify toward free night certificates.

The Radisson Rewards Visa annual fee will be credited back on a prorated basis (for up to 12 months depending on anniversary date.

Cardmembers will receive their new US Bank Altitude Go Visa in June.

Radisson Rewards expire after 24 months of inactivity so without the credit card it will be important to keep an eye out to make sure that current rewards don’t expire 24 months after the last card earnings.

Quick Thoughts

This announcement took most of us by surprise. There wasn’t any hint that US Bank would be discontinuing the cards and it’s unknown who initiated the change and also if/when Radisson will partner with another issuer. Radisson does have a much better reputation in Europe so it could be that US Bank was an awkward fit.

It’s a shame to lose the card though as the annual fee was more than covered by the anniversary bonus and many folks found the ability to generate free night awards with 5x rewards everywhere to be very useful.

The US Bank Altitude Go is a no annual fee card that earns:

4x points on dining

2x points on grocery stores gas stations and streaming services

1x points on everywhere spending.

The Altitude Go doesn’t have an annual fee or a foreign transaction fee but the points are only worth 1 cent each effectively making it a decent cashback card for dining. It’s a strange conversion from the Radisson card (albeit US Bank isn’t exactly flush with options).

A more interesting option is that the conversion could be a backdoor way of getting approved for the US Bank Altitude Reserve. For many the Altitude Reserve is a very worthwhile card. The points are worth 1.5 cents each and the card earns 3x on mobile wallet payments effectively making this a 4.5% cashback card when using that payment method. While the card does have an annual fee of $400 it offers $325 in travel/dining credits per membership year taking a big chunk out of the total fee.

The problem is that US Bank can be very difficult to get approvals with especially for multiple cards. The only card that is eligible for product change to/from the Altitude Reserve is the Altitude Go so my assumption would be that these converted cards will be eligible as well. Normally the card needs to be open for 12 months before a product change so it’s unknown if that calendar will restart upon product change or if the history the Radisson Visa will carry over. Either way this could be a very good option for folks standing on the outside looking in at the Altitude Reserve and a silver lining to the demise of the Radisson Visa.

Radisson Premier we’ll miss you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL25ld3MvcmFkaXNzb24tcmV3YXJkcy12aXNhLWNhcmQtZGlzY29udGludWVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Radisson Rewards Visa Card Being Discontinued,"A hotel credit card will be discontinued in the coming weeks and will automatically be product changed to another card with a totally different value proposition.

Radisson Rewards Visa becomes US Bank Altitude Go Visa

Per a letter to cardmembers the Radisson Rewards Premier Visa Signature Card will be automatically converted into the US Bank Altitude Go Visa Signature Card as of May 2022:

The card has historically offered 40000 bonus Radisson Rewards points on the account anniversary every year (the main reason to have this card) and that benefit will be discontinued as of April 30 2022

The card has historically offered up to three free night certificates per year one for each $10000 spent (up to $30000); only spending through April 30 2022 will qualify toward that

The US Bank Altitude Go Visa doesn’t have an annual fee and the Radisson Rewards Visa annual fee will be credited back to accounts on a prorated basis going back 12 months

Cardmembers should receive the US Bank Altitude Go Visa in June featuring the same card number

Any points earned with the card will continue to be available in your Radisson Rewards Americas account

The US Bank Altitude Go Visa Signature Card earns 4x points on dining 2x points on grocery stores gas stations EV charging stations and streaming services and 1x points on everything else (points are generally worth once cent each); while the bonus categories are decent it’s hard to get excited about the card otherwise

Radisson’s credit card is being discontinued

Why is the Radisson Rewards Visa being discontinued?

There’s no explanation as to why the Radisson Rewards Visa is being discontinued so all we can do is speculate.

Keep in mind that in mid-2021 we saw the launch of the Radisson Rewards Americas program as Radisson Rewards’ loyalty program was split in two due to requirements by the US government to limit how much information is shared with the Chinese government (Radisson is owned by a company controlled by the Chinese government). So there have been big changes to the program in general.

That doesn’t necessarily answer why this card is being discontinued though rather than just being rebranded to reflect the Radisson Rewards Americas change. I’d say there are a couple of most likely explanations:

Perhaps Radisson wants to partner with another credit card issuer to create a different type of product as US Bank isn’t big in the co-brand travel credit card space

Perhaps the portfolio simply wasn’t profitable and it wasn’t worth it for US Bank or Radisson to continue offering the card; Radisson has a lot more name recognition in Europe than the United States

Radisson has much better name recognition in Europe

Is it worth keeping the US Bank Altitude Go Visa?

I’ve had the $75 annual fee Radisson Rewards Visa for many years. The reason is very simple — the card offers 40000 anniversary bonus points plus Gold status for as long as you have the card.

I value Radisson Rewards points at 0.3 cents each so I consider the 40000 points to be worth $120 which is a deal and that’s not even factoring in the status. So holding onto the card has been an easy choice even if I haven’t spent much on the card.

Now the card is being transitioned to a no annual fee card that essentially offers rewards worth 1-4% back based on the spending category. Given my portfolio of cards I can’t imagine I’ll get much value from the card.

That being said there’s no reason to cancel the card — holding onto cards for a long time is good for your credit score and the ideal card with which to do that is a no annual fee card since it’s not costing you anything. So I have no plans to use the card but also don’t plan on spending on it (my card may eventually be canceled due to inactivity but then again I don’t know the last time I spent money on my Radisson Rewards credit card).

Bottom line

The Radisson Rewards Visa Signature Card will be discontinued shortly and cardmembers will automatically be switched to the US Bank Altitude Go Visa Signature Card. There’s no explanation for why this is happening though suffice it to say that the two cards are very different.

If you liked the Radisson Rewards Visa it’s unlikely that you’ll like the US Bank Altitude Go Visa since the cards have totally different perks annual fees and rewards structures. Since the US Bank Altitude Go has no annual fee I guess I’ll hold onto it but I can’t imagine I’ll be using it.

I’m curious to see if Radisson Rewards is simply exiting the US credit card market or if there’s more coming.

What do you make of the Radisson Rewards Visa being discontinued?

Adding an authorized user to your credit card account can be a great way to meet spending requirements accrue more points and even help a novice build their credit history. While it can be highly beneficial there are also risks associated with adding an authorized user — or even being one yourself.

It's important to choose someone who is responsible and able to repay their debts even if they're not legally obligated to do so. That's just the tip of the iceberg so here is everything you need to know about authorized users.

What is an authorized user?

An authorized user is a person who has been added to a primary credit cardholder's account. Authorized users receive cards with their names on them linked to the primary cardholder's account. They're able to use those cards to make purchases just like they would with their own cards.

Benefits of adding authorized users

Adding authorized users can be beneficial to both the primary cardholder and the authorized user for a few reasons:

The authorized user can help meet spending requirements on the primary cardholder's account.

The authorized user can establish a credit history early on.

But perhaps the best reason to add authorized users is the ability to take advantage of various card benefits for authorized users.

For example you can add up to 10 authorized users for free on the Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard® granting each of them (plus two guests or immediate family members) access to Admirals Club lounges when flying American or its partners.

Meanwhile you can add up to four authorized users for free on the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card extending access to Capital One and Priority Pass lounges for your authorized user and up to two guests.

Additionally having authorized users on your Ultimate Rewards credit card allows you to transfer rewards directly to their loyalty program accounts. This is really great if you have a stash of Ultimate Rewards points you want to transfer to a family member's MileagePlus account. Sharing United miles carries a fee of $7.50 per 500 miles plus a $30 processing fee. But you can transfer Ultimate Rewards points directly into the United MileagePlus account of an authorized user without violating any rules or incurring hefty fees.

While Chase allows household members to transfer Ultimate Rewards points to each other in order to transfer Ultimate Rewards directly into another loyalty account (e.g. United Southwest Hyatt) the other account must be held by an authorized user on your Chase credit card.

The downside of adding authorized users

The downside of adding authorized users is that it may become more difficult to track spending when two people are using the same card. Also the primary cardholder is responsible for all charges to the account. So if your authorized user goes on a spending spree and refuses to cover the charges you'll be on the hook for their purchases.

Making someone an authorized user carries risk. Only add an authorized user you completely trust and be sure to communicate ahead of time about your expectations for repayment.

Who can be an authorized user?

Barring issuer-specific age restrictions anyone can be an authorized user. American Express requires authorized users to be at least 13 years old and have no defaulted accounts with the bank. Discover imposes a minimum age of 15 and U.S. Bank requires authorized users to be at least 16 years old.

Bank of America Capital One Chase Citi and Wells Fargo do not impose age restrictions.

Can I remove an authorized user?

Removing an authorized user is as simple as calling your credit card issuer. Some banks including Citi even let you do it online. Once the user has been removed from the account which is typically done in a matter of minutes the credit card becomes inactive.

However it may take several weeks for the card to no longer be listed as an active account on your authorized user's credit report.

Get the most benefit for adding an authorized user

Some credit cards will provide incentives for adding authorized users to your account. For example the Virgin Atlantic World Elite Mastercard® currently offers 30000 Flying Club bonus miles after spending $1000 or more in purchases within the first 90 days of account opening.

Additionally you can earn up to 15000 Flying Club bonus miles every anniversary after qualifying purchases and up to 5000 Flying Club bonus miles when you add additional cardholders to your account.

The information for the Virgin Atlantic card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Furthermore if you have a credit card that offers a big spending incentive adding an authorized user is a great way to help you meet that requirement. For example spending on your Southwest credit cards counts toward the coveted Companion Pass. Earning 125000 points per year is a little easier when you have a big-spending (and responsible) authorized user to help you get there.

Another way to benefit from having an authorized user on your card is with the The Platinum Card® from American Express. The card carries a flat $195 fee to add each authorized user (see rates and fees). However this includes key benefits like lounge access complimentary Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors Gold elite status and more.

Note that you can add up to five authorized users to the American Express® Gold Card for free (see rates and fees). These authorized users can then earn Membership Rewards points at the same rate as the primary cardholder: 4 points per dollar at restaurants and 4 points per dollar at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25000 in purchases per calendar year then 1 point per dollar).

This is a great way for household members to get many of the best benefits of two rewarding cards.

How do authorized users affect my credit — and their own?

Adding an authorized user will not impact your credit unless the additional card racks up a large amount of spending and increases your credit utilization ratio. This can be avoided by paying off large balances before the statement closing date.

Meanwhile authorized users can see a positive credit impact by having access to an additional credit line and lowering their own credit utilization ratios. For those building a credit history being an authorized user can be a huge boost.

When I was in high school my sister added me as an authorized user on her Bank of America credit card. By the time my 18th birthday rolled around I had a two-year credit history and got approved for the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express. It worked out well for me and because I didn't use the card for crazy spending sprees my sister's credit wasn't negatively impacted.

It takes responsible people on both sides to mitigate possible negative impacts of adding an authorized user.

Should you open a joint account or add an authorized user?

The difference between a joint account and an authorized user comes down to liability. Joint account holders share liability for charges while authorized users do not. Primary cardholders can also limit the amount of credit an authorized user can utilize. Joint account holders together can access the full credit line.

Being a joint account holder may prevent you from qualifying for your own version of the same card in the future. For example my mom was added as a joint account holder to my dad's Chase Sapphire Preferred Card years ago. When she applied for her own card last year she was denied because Chase viewed her as already having the card. If she had been an authorized user (as opposed to a joint account holder) she would have qualified for her own card.

There isn't much of an upside to joint accounts other than lessening the burden of liability on the primary cardholder. Ideally you shouldn't be adding anyone to your credit card (as an authorized user or joint account holder) unless you trust them to use it responsibly.

Bottom line

Adding an authorized user can be widely beneficial to both parties. However it's important to be aware of the risks as the last thing you want to do is sour a relationship because of one person's financial irresponsibility. Only add an authorized user whom you completely trust to be responsible with your credit line and pay their share of the balance on time.

UBER,Uber,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3VwZXItcHVtcGVkLXRoZS1iYXR0bGUtZm9yLXViZXItc2Vhc29uLTEtZXBpc29kZS02LXJlY2FwLXRpbWUtYm9tYi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Super Pumped: The Battle For Uber' Season 1 Episode 6 Recap,"The arc of Super Pumped and Travis Kalanick’s run as CEO of Uber is basically the reaping/sowing meme from Twitter. Travis spends the early episodes doing all kinds of sowing (“Haha fuck yeah!!! Yes!!”): Rolling over the transportation board in San Francisco using Greyball to extinguish a similar threat in Portland stocking his company with “assholes” blowing venture capital to attract drivers and passengers that he intends to screw over after destroying the cab industry. Now comes the reaping (“Well this fucking sucks. What the fuck.”) when those seedlings of toxicity within the company and exploitation in the field are starting to bear their poisoned fruit.

The show is beyond caring about how any of this affects Travis. In contrast to the excellent Hulu series The Dropout which seeks to explore the contradictions and vulnerabilities of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes while also revealing the systemic fraud at her company Super Pumped isn’t interested in Travis’ human side. In fact during a scene at the hospital in this episode where Travis takes a moment to talk business with Arianna Huffington his own brother looks over and says to his ex-girlfriend Angie “Those aren’t human beings.” With his mother dead and his father seriously injured after a boating accident his preoccupation with the fate of his company is now all-consuming. Ambition has hollowed his soul.

As the headaches detailed in last week’s episodes carry over into this one — the video of Travis berating a driver and the Google lawsuit against Anthony Levandowski for theft of trade secrets chief among them — another round of errors adds to the migraine. With his reputation already shrinking among the rank-and-file at Uber Travis’ decision to join President Trump’s economic council lands badly at headquarters and worse on the streets since Trump’s virulent anti-immigrant sentiments codified in “the Muslim ban” affects many in the driving pool. To make matters worse a taxi strike in New York City inspires Uber to eliminate the surge pricing that would normally occur when the demand for rides is much higher than the supply. When the decision is made to offer cheaper fares from JFK it’s widely understood as an opportunistic form of strike-busting another chance for the company to harm the cab business at a vulnerable moment. It shouldn’t have to be said that Uber a service that relies on urban riders (and drivers) who are predominantly left-of-center politically will not want to be understood as Trump-affiliated scabs.

Enter Dan O’Sullivan a left-wing journalist from Chicago. In the political ecosystem on Twitter O’Sullivan (once @Bro_Pair now @osullyville) is well known for his scabrously funny tweets but when Uber’s New York account posted a notice that it was suspending surge pricing on rides from JFK his response was unalloyed fury: “Congrats to @Uber_NYC on breaking a strike to profit off of refugees being consigned to Hell. Eat shit and die. #deleteUber” The #deleteUber part caught fire on Twitter in much the same way users can come together for a mass public shaming. In Super Pumped O’Sullivan fires off this little torpedo while working on the sad bachelor lunch of grilled cheese sandwich — in real life he was folding laundry — but deleting Uber became a viral movement. People posted screenshots before nuking the app from their phones.

It’s a small but significant detail that Travis’ name appears next to Elon Musk’s in the headline on tech CEOs joining Trump’s advisory council because that’s the type of leader he wants to be — not the pitiful loser with the private jet but the titan of industry who owns an entire hangar. The funniest moment in the episode is a phone call where he informs the president with all the gravity he can muster that he’s withdrawing from the council and Trump just hangs up on him. He thought that he’d have the president’s ear which would be good for the company but it’s his vanity that was being served here. As Austin tells him in a fury “What you’re doing is dicking around. You need to start listening to the people here the people who helped you build this company. Because the people here they hate him. And they are starting to really hate you.”

Travis’s confidence never wavers through all of these problems — which of course is a problem in itself. Uber was built on his unchecked swagger the notion that only “assholes” could get the job done. He can’t be expected to gearshift to humility. When it comes to Uber’s workplace problems his response is to roll his eyes and say “I just need a list of shit to do. And then I’ll do that shit and people can stop freaking out.” He loves the idea of Eric Holder being the man to make that list because Holder’s position as Barack Obama’s attorney general might Febreeze the stink off Travis’ association with Trump. His embarrassingly heavy-handed attempt to charm Holder into issuing a gentle internal investigation backfires (“I don’t work for you” says Holder) and the doorstop of a report that follows lays out the company’s sins with devastating comprehensiveness.

One of the report’s recommendations is to fire Emil Michael who made the wrong kind of news in telling Buzzfeed’s Ben Smith about the possibility of “oppo” research on unfriendly journalists and being part of a story on an escort-karaoke bar excursion in Korea. (Kalanick also mentions “there’s India” referring to reports of Michael’s lack of urgency when asked to order a direct report Eric Alexander to hand over the medical records of a rape victim in India records that Alexander obtained and carried around in his briefcase for months.) Ever the loyal Smithers to Travis’ Mr. Burns Emil spares him the discomfort of having to fire him recognizing that Travis needs him to fall on the sword. They’re still bros after all. Uber is a bro culture to the end.

Off the Meter

• The show again gets too cute with the gimmickry in this episode. A scene where Bill and Arianna have a phone conversation where their actual feelings are subtitled below their more diplomatic exchange feels like a half-baked nod to Annie Hall. And Quentin Tarantino’s narration isn’t getting any better though the running #deleteUber tallies that follow are an effective graphic.

• Travis disposes of Gabi as coldly as he did Angie which is something he feels entitled to do as a certified Big Shot but it turns out to be another example of his poor judgment as a CEO. A better break-up might have kept the Seoul story from coming out. (Or you know don’t take your girlfriend and female executives on a company jaunt to an escort bar.)

• Levandowski’s line about not bothering to cover his tracks at Google is hilariously blinkered: “When you take a dump on your ex-girlfriend’s lawn you want her to know it was you not the Great Dane next door.” It turned out to be a costly shit for Mr. Levandowski who would need Donald Trump to keep him out of jail.

• More Olympic-level arrogance from Levandowski: “People like me and TK we have the ability to make the world better. And applying conventional morality to world’s most brilliant minds is insanity.”

• Last week the journalist “Olivia” was a stand-in for PandoDaily editor-in-chief Sarah Lacy. This week Olivia is Mike Isaac the New York Times reporter who broke the story on Greyball and wrote the book on which Super Pumped is based. Much more of that story to come in next week’s finale.

On a recent trip to Manhattan by way of Newark I encountered a new cancellation scheme some Uber drivers are employing to preserve their rating at the disparagement of their riders.

It’s Tough To Get A Ride(share) at Newark

I flew into Newark NJ on United this week ahead of an event and bypassed the train to take an Uber into the city. I had a work call and didn’t want to disturb others or manage switching trains on the phone with bags. Booking a professional driver and utilizing a car service made the most sense.

I was out on the curb opened the Uber app and typed in my drop off location the Hyatt Grand Central Station New York. I received a fare estimate and the Uber cost was in line with what I expected. I requested a ride I tracked their arrival in real-time and as the car approached on the app I spotted it further down the very full lane. As I confirmed the vehicle details matched my Uber trip I was disappointed for the first time of the morning; the driver cancelled. The second an Uber black car driver followed the same process. The third arrived approximately 20 minutes after I first requested an Uber and luckily the only estimate change was in terms of arrival time and not cost.

Drivers Cancelling Rides Under New Reasons to Avoid Blowback

Drivers who cancel on riders can be penalized which is why most drivers ask a user to cancel a ride instead. Drivers cancelling has been an issue for different reasons like this issue raised on ThePointsGuy whereby drivers would ask riders their destination to make their own price estimate and ask riders to cancel the ride awarding an automatically charged fee to the driver. Not all Uber drivers do this I have met more great drivers than I can count.

But on my morning ride both of the drivers cancelled and stated that I wasn’t wearing a mask. I got a notification about this in Uber. To be clear not only was I wearing a mask outside as I was ready for my ride but the drivers that cancelled were not even close enough to see my face. I only confirmed that the suspected cars were in fact my ride when they drove close enough for me to confirm their license plates.

I did not incur a booking fee for either of these cancellations but that’s beside the point. The drivers were clearly shopping for better fares. By saying that they cancelled because I wasn’t wearing a mask (there’s no dispute to this that I am aware of just a link to the CDC website) they were able to shop for more expensive rides without damaging their own rating or risking a rider reporting them cancelling due to destination. The 40-minute ride was slated for just less than $60 according to the Uber fare estimator at the time I called the ride so it wasn’t a case of a driver waiting an hour for me to request a five-minute ride.

Better Options For Travelers

Travelers may avoid this mess entirely by choosing alternatives. One such alternative is Blade the helicopter service from New York JFK International and Newark Liberty International (as I arrived on this trip) straight into Manhattan. The flight is only five minutes long and drops you at one of a handful of convenient locations in the city. However you may have to wait for your helicopter and ride with others which adds time to the five minute ride. It’s also $199 each-way so it’s drastically more expensive for what could be the same total transit time from landing at the airport to landing in Manhattan on the helipad.

Considering a JFK car service could add a little luxury and simplicity to the process. It’s helpful to have an extra set of hands loading your luggage a nice clean sedan or SUV for the ride in and the ease of knowing that you won’t encounter these sorts of issues when you arrive.

Consequences For Riders?

There’s certainly an irritation for riders who wait for drivers just to have their trip further delayed. The question that remains is whether or not this will result in a further penalty. I suspect that it will not negatively impact riders as I had just two cancellations in a single market. However I’ve known others who have been locked out entirely from Uber without any recourse at all.

Further I was fortunate that the third driver was able to take me honestly to my destination but had the wait been longer I could have been subject to surge pricing not to mention the loss of time.

Conclusion

I understand that all (Uber X Uber Black drivers and even Lyft) drivers are just trying to feed their families and it’s tough right now. Looking at the fare calculator Uber added just $0.55 in a fuel surcharge when that wouldn’t account for the difference in a single gallon of gas over the two months. It’s also clear that Uber doesn’t give drivers enough options to cancel rides for legitimate reasons to make rides a worthwhile opportunity. That doesn’t make this ok and penalties to bad behaving drivers as well as unsuspecting riders should be made clear.

As Reuters reported Friday (April 1) the law — signed Thursday (March 31) — said Uber and Lyft drivers in Washington will earn a minimum of $1.17 per mile and 34 cents per minute with minimum pay of $3 for each trip.

But while the law gives drivers things like paid sick time family medical leave long-term care programs and workers’ compensation it also bans local governments from imposing additional requirements for the ride-hailing companies and said that the drivers are not employees a sore point between labor groups and gig economy giants.

Uber and Lyft have fought several legal and political battles across the US and elsewhere to push back against laws and propositions to have their drivers declared direct employees which would qualify them for a series of benefits and impose numerous requirements on the ride-sharing companies.

The law does not affect a measure passed in Seattle in 2020 that gives drivers a minimum pay of $1.38 per mile 59 cents per minute and a per-trip minimum of $5.17.

Reuters noted that the law was supported by Uber and Lyft.

“This new law decisively gives drivers what they want — to stay independent while gaining historic new benefits and protections” Uber’s head of public policy in the Western U.S. Ramona Prieto said in a statement.

Prieto said Uber hoped the law could be replicated in other cities states and countries.

“Drivers achieved this win because labor organizations legislators and app-based companies listened to them and then worked together to drive a historic bill that works for them” Lyft’s head of government relations Jen Hensley said in a statement.

Reuters said the law was backed by the Teamsters union Local 117 which had also fought for the Seattle pay standard.

Paired with a simple yet endlessly elegant floor-length white silk gown from Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello this was a different ’do for the A-lister who typically shows up to red carpet events wearing her long hair down with natural textured waves.

Queen of all things understated and effortlessly minimal the skin care lover (who has been teasing the launch of her beauty brand Rhode) is all about enhancing her natural radiance — and her thin whimsical braid is yet another example of what’s become her signature approach to glam. Styled by Bryce Scarlett the celebrity hair guru who’s worked with stars like Margot Robbie Kaia Gerber and Lily Aldridge exclusively used FEKKAI products on Bieber’s chocolate brunette strands. With face-framing layers and a timeless trendy middle part Scarlett finished off the simple braid with a clear elastic band.

Perhaps the best part of Bieber’s dreamy look? It just might be the easiest red carpet hair to recreate yet... and lucky for you Scarlett shared exactly how he created the sleek Grammys braid.

Kevin Mazur/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images

In a statement Scarlett said he was inspired by the “elegant simplicity” of Bieber’s silk column gown and wanted to complement it with a soft clean braid.

To create it he first applied a dime-size dollop of FEKKAI’s Shea Butter Intense Oil and a slightly larger quarter-size amount of the Brilliant Gloss Multi-Tasking Perfecting Creme to Bieber’s shampooed damp hair. After detangling her strands he sprayed through the lower half of her hair with the Full Blown Volume Dry Texturizing Spray allowing for the braid to have some ‘grit’ for long-wear. Pulling forward a few face-framing strands he then began braiding her hair about two inches from her ends before securing it with a clear elastic.

Et voilà — it’s that easy.

Startland News’ Startup Road Trip series explores innovative and uncommon ideas finding success in rural America and Midwestern startup hubs outside the Kansas City metro. This series is possible thanks to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation which leads a collaborative nationwide effort to identify and remove large and small barriers to new business creation.

COLUMBIA Missouri — EquipmentShare an equipment and digital solutions provider serving the construction industry was named one of the top Missouri employers on the list of America’s Best Startup Employers 2022 by Forbes and Statista.

On the list of 500 companies EquipmentShare (at No. 222) is one of just two Missouri-based businesses and is the only construction retail business.

Click here to check out the full list of 2022 Best Startup Employers.

It’s the third consecutive year EquipmentShare has been included on the list. In 2021 EquipmentShare was one of just three businesses in the state of Missouri to be named on the list of America’s Best Startup Employers.

“We want great people at EquipmentShare so we empower them to be the best by putting them in roles where they can succeed” said Jabbok Schlacks CEO and co-founder of EquipmentShare discussing the company’s employee culture. “Our goal is to make sure our people are in roles where they can grow make a difference and feel like a valuable part of the company. That’s a huge portion of what we do and why we do it and it’s one reason why we’ve grown so quickly.”

Founded in 2015 EquipmentShare employs more than 3000 team members nationwide and currently operates more than 115 locations across the United States. The company is headquartered in Columbia and employs nearly 600 team members in the state of Missouri alone.

[Editor’s note: A previous version of this story reflected the initial release of Forbes’ America’s Best Startup Employers 2022 list which also included Kansas City’s Torch.AI led by founder and CEO Brain Weaver. The publication has since updated its list to detail San Francisco-based Torch instead. Forbes has not yet responded to Startland News inquiries to clarify the discrepancy.]

The vast majority of companies on the Forbes list hail from California as well as top startup metros like Austin Chicago Denver and New York City. The list also includes Wugen (No. 237) a St. Louis-based company that is developing universal “off-the-shelf” cell therapies for the treatment of cancer and was founded on technology licensed from Washington University in St. Louis.

To determine the list and its ranking market and consumer analyst Statista identified 2500 American businesses that had been founded between 2012 and 2019 and employ at least 50 people. Statista evaluated each organization based on three criteria the first being employer reputation.

Statista reviewed articles blogs and social media posts pertaining to each employer searching for specific phrases such as “corporate culture” “diversity” and “employee engagement.” The firm then assessed employee satisfaction evaluating online reviews as well as growth examining the organizations’ website traffic and headcounts over a two-year period.

The final list ranks the 500 employers that boast the best employer reputations employee satisfaction and growth.

EquipmentShare has experienced explosive growth which its co-founders brothers Jabbok and Willy Schlacks attribute to their team’s dedication.

“The No. 1 factor in our company’s growth and success is our employees” said Willy Schlacks President and co-founder of EquipmentShare.

The startup is dedicated to improving the way construction does business by partnering with customers to solve problems the company described. More than a rental company EquipmentShare is an equipment and digital solutions provider serving the construction industry. Through its award-winning fleet management technology and equipment rental retail and service distribution EquipmentShare solves the industry’s pain points with its cloud platform technology T3 which empowers contractors to work more efficiently.

“EquipmentShare prides itself on providing a people-first workplace” the company said in a press release. “Employees are not just names on the payroll at EquipmentShare. With a holistic focus on wellness of the mind body and spirit EquipmentShare believes if employees feel like they are well taken care of they will turn that around and make their customers feel the same way.”

The approach helps the startup compete for top talent said Leslie Adams EquipmentShare’s lead recruiter.

“We are building the future of construction and a better place to work” Adams said. “If you’re going to leave your family and spend a lot of your time at work you need to like it. We want our employees to feel valued and in turn they will stay with us and do good work.”

With a focus on hiring more veterans and those who served the U.S. the company is currently recruiting for a variety of roles in equipment sales technology installation maintenance and service software engineering and more.

Perhaps the last two years of pandemic-related upheaval have intensified the dream of getting away from the daily grind to resettle in an ideal place. And for many life by the beach is that ideal.

In most of the U.S. property by the seashore comes at a premium and home prices are out of reach for many retirees. However quite a few countries around the world offer pristine beaches low cost of living and attractive lifestyles making them affordable destinations for those whose hearts are set on beachfront living.

These are some of the countries that make it possible to find that place by the sea and live comfortably for a fraction of what it would cost in the U.S. Most have expat communities reasonably priced healthcare affordable homes and residency options.

Deanna Mills ran three of these safety-net health centers during a career that spanned four decades — all so that patients could overcome barriers to staying well and receiving needed treatment.

Mills viewed it as a matter of fairness that everyone should be able to find high-quality and affordable medical and dental care colleagues said. Her work focused on supporting low-income Minnesotans and those in racial and ethnic minority groups who routinely suffer worse outcomes when diagnosed with a variety of health conditions.

Mills died on March 9 after a short illness with cancer. The Clearwater resident was 67.

""Her spirit lives on in every community health center in this state"" said Jonathan Watson executive director of the Minnesota Association of Community Health Centers. ""It takes a unique person to run a community health center — to have the business acumen and the spirit of social justice for populations that are often overlooked in our state unfortunately. So she was that voice.""

Deanna Eileen Mills was born in Minneapolis. She earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in public health at the University of Minnesota.

Beginning in 1987 Mills served more than four years as executive director of Southside Community Health Services a small nonprofit medical and dental clinic that served low-income residents in south Minneapolis.

She moved to a larger community health center in north Minneapolis serving as executive director. In this role Mills participated in a meeting with then-First Lady Hillary Clinton on health care reform proposals.

After several years of consulting work Mills served nine years as executive director of Community-University Health Care Center in the Phillips neighborhood of south Minneapolis.

The clinic was one of Minnesota's first community health centers but it was struggling in the mid-2000s with financial problems that forced a layoff of 20 people.

""She just really stood strong and kind of weathered the storm and really kept the team going"" said Colleen McDonald Diouf the clinic's current chief executive.

Mills helped launch and lead a pioneering collaboration across the safety-net clinics that boosted quality by helping people avoid unnecessary and costly trips to the emergency room and hospital.

It was recognized by an outside report in 2013 that described the program's success and included without attribution a comment from Mills explaining how 10 health centers in the group had shifted from ""fierce competitors to fierce collaborators.""

""She'd tell me all the time people need to see the value of why coming together is better … She was just an amazing woman — tough as nails and a heart of gold"" McDonald Diouf said.

Mills recently resigned due to illness from the board of directors at Dodoma Tanzania Health Development which helps support a major medical center in the African country.

""Her strength was getting things done through other people but her magic was getting people to do more things — and do them better — than they thought they could"" said Anthony Hall her husband.

The couple loved to travel including trips to watch birds. Prized sightings for Mills included trogons in Costa Rica and a chestnut-collared longspur in North Dakota.

In addition to her husband Mills is survived by children Marcus Hall of Nashville Demetrius Hall of Brooklyn Center and Patricia Hall of Phoenix. She also is survived by two sisters a brother and two grandchildren.

A memorial service is planned for 11 a.m. May 14 at Park Avenue United Methodist Church 3400 Park Av. S. Minneapolis.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Last December the World Bank announced that it had approved $60 million grant financing to establish a project known as the Sierra Leone Quality Essential Health Services and Systems Support Project to provide maternal and child health services for two million people in the country.

According to the World Bank the Sierra Leone Quality Essential Health Services and Systems Support Project is funded by a $40 million International Development Association (IDA) grant and $20 million grant from the Global Financing Facility (GFF) “to help the Government of Sierra Leone build resilient efficient and equitable health systems for expanding coverage and utilization of essential health services and to reduce diseases and mortality of Serra Leoneans.”

Making this announcement last December said Abdu Muwonge World Bank Country Manager for Sierra Leone said: “The World Bank is happy to support this operation through additional financing to the Ministry of Health and Sanitation as it continues to improve health services delivery in Sierra Leone by building on past projects to strengthen disease prevention pandemic preparedness and response through an integrated approach at the district level” “It will help improve quality Essential Health Services (EHS) and increase utilization of health services and improve the health status of the population.”

The World Bank in its statement also said that “The Quality Essential Health Services and Systems Support project will support the implementation of an innovative approach to deliver health services at the district level particularly for women and children Implemented through a Public Private Partnership. This approach arranges service delivery assets into a network consisting of an anchor health facility (hub) which offers a range of services complemented by lower-level facilities (spokes) that offer limited services and refer patients who require more intensive services to the hub for treatment. The project will also invest in holistic primary health care systems focusing on equity including upgrading infrastructure equipment and supply of essential drugs and commodities and improving health facility management to support among other outcomes safe deliveries among pregnant women.”

“The project is aligned with the GoSL’s National Development Plan 2019–2023 whose main objective is to accelerate human capital and transform the health sector into a well-resourced and functioning national health care delivery system that is affordable and accessible to all” Kofi Amponsah World Bank Senior Health Economist and Task Team Leader announced. “The project will collaborate with sectors beyond health which have impact on health and nutrition outcomes such as in water agriculture education and energy for greater cross‐sectoral links and synergies”.

Last Friday 1st April 2022 President Bio formally acknowledged this funding and thanked the World Bank at an event held in State House Freetown where he spoke about the importance of the Quality Essential Health Services and Support Project.

This is what he said:

“Honourable Ministers of Government Representatives of the World Bank Executive Director Partners in Health Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen Good morning: I want to start by thanking The World Bank for sharing and supporting our vision that strengthening health systems and improving health service delivery is critical for human capital development and for sustainable development.

We made a simple argument in our manifesto that “development is about people” and “no meaningful development can take place in any nation without developing the human capital.” Part of involves “improving health care [and] protecting poor and vulnerable population groups.” We were mindful of health disparities and moved by the poor state of health services in 2018.

We have followed our commitment to achieving Universal Health Coverage with concrete actions including increasing the healthcare budget recruiting and training more healthcare staff restructuring our health sector improving and expanding national ambulance and laboratory services expanding the range of healthcare services refurbishing and building healthcare facilities and improving access to and affordability of healthcare across the country. Some weeks ago at York Village we introduced a health-on-wheels initiative to take healthcare into under-served and far to reach communities.

By taking healthcare services to within a five-mile radius of every Sierra Leonean we have improved health outcomes and lowered disease burdens. Maternal and infant mortality are down and we will work to reduce them even further. Vaccination rates are higher now. Malaria kills far fewer Sierra Leoneans now. More persons living with HIV and TB are receiving life-saving medication.

We have strengthened disease surveillance teams and we have quickly and effectively responded to potential epidemics. We have successfully fought against successive waves of COVID-19 (to much international acclaim I must add) keeping fatalities to a minimum.

In all of this we have been intentional inclusive and innovative knowing that each Sierra Leonean deserves to live a healthy life and contribute his or her fair share to our nation’s development.

So I want to thank our development partners who have believed in us and believed with us that our goals are achievable. You have generously supported our shared aspirations for our people with technical expertise equipment and grants. Thank you.

Previous speakers have laid out the scope of the project from various perspectives. This project concretises our ongoing development partnership with the World Bank. It also enhances our partnerships with Partners in Health (PIH-SL. We are engaging them to replicate the Kono model in Kailahun as well as support the other four districts to achieve same impressive outcomes.

As I have indicated we are intentional about our interventions. We have looked at the data and looked at the comparative poverty rates. We have selected areas with high poverty rates: Bonthe Falaba Kailahun Tonkolili and Western Area Rural. For those who speak in terms of regional distribution that’s two districts in the north one in the south one in the east and one in the west.

Additionally we considered that these areas shared one or more of the following: high disease burden high number of deliveries geographically hard-to-reach areas large numbers of patients large catchment populations high population with high healthcare service utilisation.

In addition to the foregoing Falaba was declared a district by the previous government without a district hospital or district health management team office. Since 2018 we have had to develop new health systems for that district and we are working hard on that. We will soon pronounce the result of our efforts for the good people of Falaba.

As indicated the project is intended to address high levels of maternal and child mortality in Sierra Leone in the beneficiary districts. So the primary beneficiaries are women and children. This grant will be used to finance a hub-and-spoke services delivery model. We will identify hubs in each district cluster and then distribute and improve quality essential health services at each of the satellite stations.

The following district facilities will be upgraded as hubs: For Bonthe District: (United Brethren in Christ (UBC) Hospital CHC Moriba Town CHC Tihun). For Kailahun District: (CHC Bandajuma Yawei CHC Buedu Jojoima-CHC). For Falaba District: (CHC Kurubonla CHC Falaba CHC HEALTH SYSTEMS STRENGTHENING 5 5 Mongo). For Tonkolili District: (CHC Hinistas CHC Masingbi CHC Bendugu). For the Western Area Rural (Waterloo CHC Goderich)

We intend to achieve a number of goals with this project. First we want to ensure that skilled health personnel are available in target districts. Secondly pregnant women should attend ante-natal clinic at least four times and all deliveries are attended by skilled health personnel.

Next we want to ensure that children are fully immunised. Finally all mothers and children should receive basic nutrition services in health facilities. Therefore we intend to invest this grant in a number of core areas in order to realise our project outcomes: For staff training we will strengthen academic staffing review curriculum and establish a formal affiliation between the University of Sierra Leone and the Makeni School of Clinical Sciences.

Further there will also be support for curriculum development for Medicine and Allied Health Sciences including the Dentistry Department and Public Health Department and Midwifery School.

The grant will also help the Government of Sierra Leone finance and expand ongoing training of general surgery students including ensuring full accreditation for postgraduate training in paediatrics obstetrics and gynaecology.

The project will also support specialised postgraduate training in medico-surgical nursing midwifery and paediatrics and other relevant fields. We will also enhance our recruitment and training initiatives.

At the community level first aid kits will be supplied to selected schools in Bonthe Falaba Kailahun Tonkolili and Western Area Rural Districts. Teachers will be trained in basic health care skills to allow them to treat first aid cases that occur in schools.

For infrastructure we will construct the 14 health facilities designated as hubs and spokes. We will also ensure the provision of laboratories and medical equipment and supplies. We will also apportion some amount to supporting operations of the national ambulance services.

The project will also pilot an eco-friendly Centralized Bio-Medical Waste Treatment Facility in Western Urban and Western Area Rural districts in the Freetown area. At the operational levels we will install facility-level management information systems that will enhance the development of integrated clinical processes data registries digital forms and other documentation. As a consequence digital patient files will be generated to inform clinical decision-making as essential parts of the electronic medical records system.

Critical to attaining universal health coverage is sustainable healthcare financing. The project will support the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance scheme that will drive the objective of making healthcare affordable.

The grant will also support the local production of affordable nutrient- and protein-rich foods including Bennimix. This enhanced protein-rich food will support the growth of malnourished infants children under 5 pregnant and lactating mothers and other vulnerable adults.

Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen let me close this short statement by thanking the World Bank again for their generous support. We also anticipate working effectively with Partners in Health over the next five years as we implement this project.

As I have always said human capital development will drive and accelerate sustainable development in this nation. We will pursue that objective with purpose.

I thank you for your kind attention and I now formally pronounce receipt of a grant of Sixty Million United States from the World Bank to the Quality Essential Health Services and Systems Support Project.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uLmFmcmljYS9rZW55YS9uZXdzLy1saWZlY2FyZS1ob3NwaXRhbHMtZW1iYXJrcy1tYWpvci1leHBhbnNpb24tcGxhbi0zNzcwNDg00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lifecare Hospitals embarks on major expansion plan,"Lifecare Hospitals a leading medical services provider operating a chain of Level 5 hospitals has announced an aggressive expansion plan across the country to meet growing demand for specialty healthcare.

The multi-specialty hospital founded in September 2017 in Bungoma Town has signaled plans to open three more hospitals across the country to bring hospitals under its portfolio to eight by the end of 2023.

Currently the LifeCare has hospitals in Bungoma Migori and Kikuyu towns with plan now to open three more in Meru Eldoret and Mlolongo.

This as the hospital’s management targets to raise its bed capacity from the current 450 beds to 600 beds by the end of next year in the eight hospitals in line with its aim to provide best in-class healthcare services to all individuals within the local and extended areas.

The first multi-specialty hospital in Bungoma Town boasts of 100-bed capacity 15 ICU beds and 2 modular operating theatres.

The homegrown chain of hospitals offers primary care specialty clinics surgical services mother and child care critical care unit dental services diagnostics and laboratory services.

“This year our plan of action is to open doors to LifeCare multi-specialty in Meru county and LifeCare Super-Specialty hospitals in Eldoret and LifeCare multi-specialty in Mlolongo” said Chief Executive Officer Mr Vikram Jit Singh in a statement.

He said they aim to bring universal health care closer to communities across the country affirming their commitment to provision of quality and affordable healthcare to patients.

“The rebranding of LifeCare is momentous to us as it sets precedence for our expansion across Kenya and the rest of Africa. Our plan to increase our footprint across Kenya will enable us to have eight hospitals by 2023” said Mr Singh.

“LifeCare Hospital’s core values of compassion accountability responsibility and excellence will continue to power our patient-centric approach” he added.

In 2021 LifeCare Hospitals set in motion a fully-fledged multi-specialty hospital in Migori County with a bed capacity of 75 beds and in Kikuyu town with a bed capacity of 50 beds in phase one and an additional 60 beds in phase two in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9yZXNpZGVudHMtb2YtY2hvcmtvci1jaGVtdWVuYS1iZW5lZml0LWZyb20tamFwYW4tdW5kcC1jaHBzLWZhY2lsaXR5L9IBXWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9yZXNpZGVudHMtb2YtY2hvcmtvci1jaGVtdWVuYS1iZW5lZml0LWZyb20tamFwYW4tdW5kcC1jaHBzLWZhY2lsaXR5Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Residents Of Chorkor Chemuena Benefit From Japan UNDP CHPS Facility,"United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in collaboration with Ghana Health Service has constructed a Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) at Chorkor Chemuena in Accra with a Japanese Government Fund.

The facility was constructed and equipped as part of the project dubbed: “strengthening community health systems to support the continuity of essential services for the vulnerable during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The project is to support essential health services provision in Chorkor Chemuena under the Ablekuma South sub-metro.

Mr Mochizuki Hisanobu the Ambassador of Japan to Ghana speaking at the ceremony on Friday said Japan had provided support for important health initiatives including facility development in the health sector in Africa through the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD).

He said at TICAD 7 which held in 2019 the Government of Japan launched the Africa Health and Wellbeing Initiative aiming to establish sustainable healthcare systems suitable for Africa with the view to achieving Universal Health Coverage.

TICAD 8 he said would be held on August 27 and 28 2022 to provide opportunity for strengthening Japan-Africa cooperation to overcome health challenges exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

He commended UNDP for its dynamic partnership with the Government of Japan which had brought effective support in health-related projects in Ghanaand encouraged the people of Chorkor Chemuena to utilize the facility fully as they sustained the edifice.

Mr Sukhrob Khoshmukhamedov UNDP Deputy Resident Representative said the CHPS was a pragmatic strategy aimed at promoting access and equity in health service provision and bringing health services close to communities in deprived hard-to-reach or vulnerable localities.

Through the concept he said communities had been actively and meaningfully engaged in planning and delivering healthcare and empowered to become players and partners in their own health and well-being.

He said effective implementation of the CHPS concept would be critical if Ghana was to attain Universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goal 3 aimed at ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all.

“As part of this intervention UNDP in collaboration with Ghana Health Service is also strengthening the capacity of other health facilities and CHPS Zones in Accra Metro and Ga Central to ensure continued essential health services provision for underserved communities” he said.

He was confident that the facility would strengthen access and quality of community health service provision and ultimately contribute to better health outcomes within Chorkor and its immediate environs.",,,

Don't worry you're not alone and you're probably not having an out-of-body experience. The latest trend in spam text messages involves mobile phone users receiving texts from what appears to be their own phone number. The messages typically claim to be from the user's wireless carrier referencing the recipient's wireless bill and including a link to a ""free gift."" Spoiler alert: The link leads to potentially malicious websites instead according to users on Reddit and Twitter. It's all potentially very confusing. Here's what you need to know about these spam texts and what you can do about them:

Why am I getting these texts?

On Monday The Verge reported that the phenomenon appears to only affect Verizon Wireless customers. A Verizon spokesperson confirmed the issue in a statement to CNBC Make It. ""As part of a recent fraud scheme bad actors have been sending text messages to some Verizon customers which appear to come from the customers' own number"" Verizon spokesperson Rich Young said. ""Since uncovering the scheme our company has made a significant effort to limit the current activity."" Young noted a recent uptick in spam text messages across all wireless carriers and said Verizon is ""actively working with others in our industry and with U.S. law enforcement as part of an investigation aimed at identifying and stopping these fraudsters and their illegal actions.""

Robokiller a company that makes a mobile app to block spam calls and texts said it had tracked more than 5000 incidents of the same-number spam text messages over the past week as of Thursday. According to Robokiller typical versions of the spam texts feature messages that say ""Free Msg: Your bill is paid for March"" along with a dubious link that claims to offer a free gift. In other cases the spam message includes a link that claims to take the recipient to a Verizon survey according to CNET. A writer for The Verge noted that clicking on the link in one particular message took the writer to the website for Channel One Russia a television network run by the Russian government. ""We have no indication of any Russian involvement"" in the spam texts Young said. A spokesman for AT&T told CNBC Make It: ""We are monitoring this situation closely and have not seen anything similar on our network."" A spokesperson for T-Mobile did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.

What about other kinds of spam texts?

The recent spate of same-number spam texts comes amid a rise in overall spam texts received by U.S. wireless customers in recent years. Last year the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) warned that spam texts have been rising during the Covid-19 pandemic with scammers more likely to prey on desperate Americans suffering from health or financial hardships. Robokiller said Americans received a total of 87.8 billion spam text messages in 2021 a 58% increase from the previous year. Spam texts are often referred to as SMS phishing or ""smishing"" attacks where scammers try to trick wireless users into sharing personal information or clicking on malware-ridden links. In some cases spammers trick your phone's Caller ID to make it seem like a text or call is coming from a local or government-associated number a practice called ""spoofing."" In the case of the same-number spam texts it appears that ""bad actors"" are even able to spoof recipients' own numbers – adding another layer to the process.

What can I do about it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlYWNvbmpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wNC8wMy9iZXR0eS1saW4tZmlzaGVyLWNhbGxpbmctYmFjay11bnJlY29nbml6ZWQtcGhvbmUtbnVtYmVyLXNjYW0vNzE0MDc2NjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Don't call back unrecognized numbers; it could cost you a lot|Betty Lin-Fisher,"Local reader E.B. Wilson used to return all phone calls on her cellphone without really looking at the phone number or thinking about it.

But she’s changing that habit after getting a surprising Verizon bill for about $750 for a call she inadvertently returned to India — and which Verizon said lasted 207 minutes.

Her experience is also a good warning to beware of the one-ring scam which I wrote about several years ago. Back then consumer advocates weren’t quite sure what the catch might be to a person getting a one-ring call to their phone with no answer or with a strange ""can you hear me."" Some questioned whether scammers were recording people saying ""yes"" to trick them somehow.

More:Betty Lin-Fisher: Be careful of ‘Can you hear me’ calls and how you respond

Wilson 77 explained it this way when she reached out to me at the end of February:

“About a month or so ago my Verizon cell rang and I just answered it without looking at the number — and no one was there. My routine is just to hit a redial as I often can’t move fast enough to answer. No one answered so I hung up and I looked at the number and it had 12 digits not nine. I did not know this meant outside the U.S.”

Wilson said there was no way she was on the phone with India for 207 minutes since she remembers hanging up on the empty phone call and calling a local Italian restaurant right afterward to order some takeout.

“I never thought of it again till I got a phone bill for over $700 which is on dispute with Discover” Wilson said.

Wilson shared a copy of her January Verizon bill which showed the 207-minute call to a 12-digit number and then also other local cellphone calls also within that same time period.

When I reached out to Verizon spokesman Andrew Testa said it was likely that Wilson’s call was part of what’s being called the Wangiri scam.

Wangiri is a Japanese word meaning ""one (ring) and cut” Testa said. “It’s a telephone scam technique where your phone rings once and then stops in hopes that you will call the number back. If you do call back it goes to a high-cost international number meaning you will be charged for that call and the scammer will make money.”

Federal Trade Commission warning

The Federal Trade Commission has also warned of these one-ring scams.

“For illegal robocallers the goal isn't always getting you to answer. Sometimes it's getting you to call

“One-ring calls may appear to be from phone numbers somewhere in the United States including three initial digits that resemble U.S. area codes. But savvy scammers often use international numbers from regions that also begin with three-digit codes — for example ""232"" goes to Sierra Leone and ""809"" goes to the Dominican Republic. Scammers may also use spoofing techniques to further mask the number in your caller ID display” the FTC said referring to fake numbers.

The FTC said if you call back you risk being connected to a phone number outside the U.S.

“As a result you may wind up being charged a fee for connecting along with significant per-minute fees for as long as they can keep you on the phone. These charges may show up on your bill as premium services international calling or toll-calling” the FTC said.

Variations of this scam rely on phony voicemail messages urging you to call a number with an unfamiliar area code to ""schedule a delivery"" or to notify you about a ""sick"" relative the FTC said.

Verizon response

Testa said Verizon “is working to protect our customers from Wangiri scam calls but some calls do go through while Verizon's analytics are detecting the fraud campaign and working to put call blocks into place. Verizon will not charge you for calls back to Wangiri-identified numbers.

He offered these tips for Verizon customers which were similar to ones offered by the FTC as well; most of the tips could also apply to other cellphone providers:

Turn on ‘International block’ in the Call Filter app if you don't normally receive international calls (this will block all international calls even ones you may want to receive).

Don't call back any unknown numbers or any numbers that don’t appear to be a 10-digit U.S. number.

If you do call back and hear a suspicious message hang up immediately. The longer you stay on the phone the more you are being charged.

Report the phone number as a scammer through the Call Filter app or at VoiceSpamFeedback.com.

It took Wilson a little time — and lots of calls initially to Verizon and Discover and then emails with me back and forth to Testa who directed Verizon customer service representatives to call Wilson — but eventually it appeared that Verizon credited her bill and her Discover account also looked OK.

Testa also said Verizon investigated the 207-minute call that was logged on to Wilson’s bill even though she said she had hung up immediately after returning the call.

“We've investigated the issue and found that the extended international call was an error. We worked with Mrs. Wilson to resolve the issue to her satisfaction and helped to add International Call blocking to her account” he said.

New habit

Wilson said she’s learned a hard lesson and is grateful she won’t be responsible for the charges.

“I get regular nuisance calls on my landline people pretending to be from some official place to get my credit card number surveys solicitors etc. I do not get many calls on the cellphone that I do not know the caller. That is why when my phone rang while I was moving things in the garage I could not answer quick enough but soon redialed without looking. I got no answer and hung up and then looked at the number. I saw about 12 or 13 digits on the number but did not know what it meant at the time.

“I won’t do that again. Verizon was good enough to put a block on out-of-the-country calls for my phone. I don’t know anyone outside the country. My new practice will be not to answer a call I don’t recognize the number. Check if they left a voice message if not no call back. This last month since this has started has been frustrating and stressful” she said.

That’s because as anyone who’s ever been near a Broadway theater knows Hammerstein was the lyricist half of any number of partnerships responsible for hits spanning decades.

But David Charles Abell has a point to make about Hammerstein and he makes it beautifully in his two-hour-plus all-Hammerstein revue with the Philly Pops. In stitching together a couple of dozen songs with spoken biographical details Abell argues that here was artistic force so potent that his gift for storytelling and lyricism inspired composers like Jerome Kern and Richard Rodgers to do their very best work.

You also had to feel Friday night at the show’s opening in Verizon Hall that there’s a particular brand of American optimism pulsing through Hammerstein’s words. The Philly Pops has evolved artistically in the past few years and especially since Abell took over in 2020. An outing with the ensemble though still means a trip in a time machine and with three excellent singers and the 122-voice Philly Pops Festival Chorus we found ourselves pining for a spot up on a hill.

Someday we’ll build a home On a hilltop high you and I Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill. And we’ll be pleased to be called “The folks who live on the hill.”

Vocalists Liz Callaway and Damian Humbley took on the song within the lone accompaniment of pianist Jeff Smith snuggling up to the curvy contours of the melody. The sentiments of the 1937 song especially as they are set to Jerome Kern’s misty music are an idealized vision of American domestic ambition (and far more human and relatable than Ronald Reagan’s “shining city on a hill”). “The Folks Who Live on a Hill” has drawn interpretations from Peggy Lee and Mel Tormé to Bette Midler and Eric Clapton.

The American Dream wasn’t open to everyone (then in 1937 or now) a point implicitly made by the inclusion of Hammerstein’s most substantive piece of social criticism. Sandwiched in between Don Walker’s orchestration of Richard Rodgers’ “June is Bustin’ Out All Over” and “I’m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair” came “You’ve Got to Be Carefully Taught.”

The 1949 song from South Pacific says that hate and fear of “people whose eyes are oddly made and people whose skin is a diff’rent shade” isn’t inherent to human nature but learned.

The show’s creators were pressured to remove the song from the musical but Rodgers and Hammerstein stood their ground as Abell said in comments to the audience. Some Georgia lawmakers viewed it as a threat to the American way of life and introduced legislation banning entertainment with “an underlying philosophy inspired by Moscow.”

Hammerstein — born in New York City and a Doylestown resident for the last two decades of his life — was no radical of course. His ear for the meaning and rhythms of text was as pure an American art form as this country has ever known.

With vocalists Callaway Humbley and Rosena Hill Jackson the Pops’ show Friday cycled through operetta Broadway and more. There were no standouts among the performances which included “People Will Say We’re In Love” “All the Things You Are” or “Why Was I Born?” — though Callaway had clarity and charm and Jackson a sound that was both lithe and velvety. Humbley had a clarion tenor that molded itself to precise emotional moments.

Abell didn’t neglect the orchestral aspect of the evening. The Pops was string-rich for this program in the loveliest way and the ensemble was embedded with strong solo moments from oboist David Schneider flutist Frances Tate harpist Andre Tarantiles and horn player John David Smith.

What impressed most though was the overall sound buoyed by Abell’s smart taste for inventive orchestrations — the sound of an unbounded optimism that spoke to a better America wherever it might be.

One his restaurants Clancy's in Dennis Port was open year round before the pandemic. Now it's only open seasonally because they don't have enough staff. His other restaurant the Flying Bridge in Falmouth only has enough workers to stay open four days a week for lunch and dinner.

He says he needs to hire 70 to 90 people to get both restaurants up and running again year round.

""If we're lucky we'll get half"" said Hayes who is also vice president of the management company Cape Cod Restaurants.

Hayes is not alone. Businesses all along Cape Cod are seeing a shortage of workers particularly seasonal workers who help the region in the busy summer months. Restaurants hotels and other businesses typically depend on teenagers college students and international workers visiting on J-1 and H-2B visa programs to pad Barnstable County's workforce which typically increases by roughly 20000 seasonal jobs in the summer.

But factors like the pandemic housing stock and costs and even international affairs are impacting this year's availability of workers.

Tom Murphy is the president of the Yarmouth Restaurant Association which represents a couple dozen restaurants in the town. In his roughly 25 years working with the association he says last summer and this summer have been the worst worker shortages he's seen. He says the pandemic is part of it but this year the invasion of Ukraine also seems to be a factor. Murphy says he's hearing less people are applying for the two visa programs and the crisis is additionally impacting whether those who have applied will even be able to get to the United States.

""I think everybody's got a question in their mind whether it's going to work out or not"" said Murphy.

The J-1 program is visa that allows international residents to work and live for a limited time in the U.S. According to data from the State Department's website 7501 J-1 visas were granted to Massachusetts in 2021 for workers year-round — that's compared with 20441 visas granted in 2019. It's unknown how many of those were for workers on the Cape and Islands.

""Some of these guys have worked for our company for 15 to 18 years...and they need this income themselves. It's not just our businesses it's their livelihoods."" Taylor Hayes Cape Cod Restaurants

H-2B visas require businesses to sponsor workers. This year the cap for the number of workers was increased which means there'll be more workers accepted into the program overall but that may or may not translate to more workers for the Cape since the program is run as a lottery system. H-2B visas are distributed in two rounds one for October through March the other for April through September.

Taylor Hayes of Cape Cod Restaurants says his company was granted six workers in the first round of visa payouts. He's hoping for more in the second round of distribution. Typically his restaurants will employ between 55 and 70 H-2B visa holders a summer. He says getting the workers he needs is more than just good for his business.

""Some of these guys have worked for our company for 15 to 18 years ... and they need this income themselves"" said Hayes. ""It's not just our businesses it's their livelihoods.""

Tom Murphy of the Yarmouth Restaurant Association says Cape Cod restaurants are expecting a banner year with more and more people feeling comfortable to travel and vacation again. And restaurants will get through the summer and see success. But less employees also means some restaurants will have to limit their hours or close down for one day each week to support the staff they do have. He says many restaurants on the Cape are seasonal where they depend on eight to 10 weeks of income to support them throughout the whole year.

""Say you're in Boston you have 52 weeks a year and you have Friday Saturday and Sunday as your big nights"" said Murphy. ""On the Cape ... let's say it's eight weeks. You have to consider that every night is like a Saturday night for a restaurant in Boston. So for them to close just one night it's taking a very large percentage of their gross. They're not doing it because they're lazy they're not doing it for any other reason than they don't have the help to cover all the shifts.""

State Sen. Julian Cyr who represents the Cape and the Islands knows what it's like to cover shifts. His family owned Adrian's a restaurant in Truro for decades and he remembers helping out when they didn't have enough staff.

He says staffing has always been a problem on the Cape but it's been exacerbated by housing prices. He says in the last year there's been a 20% increase in those prices. The pandemic has also changed what's available — and what's affordable — in the region says Cyr with many people selling their homes on the Cape or making their summer homes along the water their main residence to get away from the city.

""Many of the workers whom we rely on year after year who either make a life here year-round or come back just can't find housing"" said Cyr. ""I have 17 friends ... who are leaving this summer who are not able to stay here this summer in Provincetown in the outer Cape because they can't find summer housing. This is a real catastrophe for us.""

Cyr says this also applies to international visa holders who are responsible for finding and paying for their own summer housing. He says the Cape needs to ""build our way out of this problem"" focusing on building and creating affordable housing in the region. It's a solution that hits close to home for him.

""I'm a millennial Cape Coder and I cannot afford to purchase property in the part of the district that I represent right on the outer Cape where I was born where I grew up where my family lives"" said Cyr. ""And I'm someone who has quite a bit of access and privilege right? We are desperately struggling and I am really worried that we are reaching a tipping point where we are not going to be able to sustain year-round communities.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvbmF0aW9uYWwvbW9ybW9ucy1pbmMtY2h1cmNoLWFjY3VzZWQtb2YtbXVsdGluYXRpb25hbC10YXgtcm9ydC0yMDIyMDMzMC1wNWE5OHAuaHRtbNIBaWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvbmF0aW9uYWwvbW9ybW9ucy1pbmMtY2h1cmNoLWFjY3VzZWQtb2YtbXVsdGluYXRpb25hbC10YXgtcm9ydC0yMDIyMDMzMC1wNWE5OHAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mormons Inc: Church accused of multinational tax rort,"The tax structure has meant that since 2015 Australian adherents have been able to draw on $400 million in tax deductions not available to followers of other religions or denominations. A Mormon Church spokesman did not respond to written questions about this discrepancy but said the church operated in accordance with tax laws. Dr Neville Rochow QC says the church has structured itself to minimise tax. In the mid-2010s Dr Rochow was involved in a Mormon-instigated econometric study used to justify its tax status and to ensure that religious trust properties of other churches were not taxed. Soon after it started to direct substantial donations and tithing through its charitable trust – a decision he was not involved in. Before that in a submission it made to Treasury the church said it spent just $36000 a year on average on charitable donations between 1985 and 2010. There has been little to no growth in the 61600 Mormon adherents in Australia over the past decade that could explain the reported 2000-fold increase in charitable giving.

Each year funds are transferred from the church’s charitable trust to a separate entity Sydney-based LDS Charities Australia. From that entity about $70 million a year is distributed to global charitable causes. The church spokesman said after LDS Charities Australia was created in 2012 “there was a desire and the ability to significantly increase the support of global humanitarian and development projects”. That $70 million a year is close to the amount the global church – whose strongest following is in the United States – itself says it gives each year on average throughout the world according to its own annual reports. LDS Charities Australia has no paid staff Australian website expenses or infrastructure to run what purports to be one of the country’s major charities collecting more in individual donations than Oxfam Beyond Blue or Caritas Australia the Catholic Church’s international aid charity. It runs in parallel with the Utah-based Latter-Day Saints Charities which apparently directs the church’s charitable spending throughout the world and includes all its senior staff management and infrastructure.

A church spokesman denied LDS Charities Australia was run by Utah-based Latter Day Saints Charities and said it funded programs through other charities including the Red Cross Water for the People and the World Food Programme allowing it to keep costs low. “All decisions about which projects are funded are made right here in Australia” the spokesman said. The programs it cited were also funded by its Utah-based charity. University of Tampa professor of sociology Ryan Cragun an expert on Mormonism said it was inconceivable that the church was making significant global charitable decisions from Australia. “It’s a stunningly hierarchical religion” Professor Cragun said. “So any big decisions like that are going to be made in Salt Lake City.” In 2019 the Australian Tax Office made a binding ruling that for an Australian charity to have deductible gift recipient (DGR) status – which allows tax write-offs for donors – it must have Australia as “the focal point of the DGR in a legal or organisational sense”.

University of Tampa sociology professor Ryan Cragun Krystian Seibert a charities expert at Swinburne University’s Centre for Social Impact speaking in general terms said the DGR rule meant the operations and management decisions of a charity needed to be made from Australia. “It can of course engage and consult with partner organisations outside Australia but if it effectively outsources operational and management decision-making to individuals or organisations that are outside Australia that could raise issues under our tax laws.” Mormonism is a US religious movement that began in the 19th century and has become incredibly wealthy. A Washington Post investigation in 2020 revealed the church was secretly running a $US100 billion investment fund Ensign Peak Advisors that was accumulating vast tax-free wealth by investing in hedge funds Chevron Visa Apple and some of the biggest landholdings in the US.

Professor Cragun said the church for a time disclosed its charitable giving which equated to less than 1 per cent of its revenue. “It is shocking how little they give” he suggested. ”But on the flipside this is the part that’s really interesting: they advertise it every single time. And that’s where the ex-Mormon in me is like ‘That’s exactly what Jesus said not to do’.“ He said many of the church’s current leaders – called apostles – had backgrounds in senior positions in the corporate world. The international church he said was run like a multinational corporation with practices all but identical around the world. According to Cragun the church is likely to “milk the system for every tax deduction they can... And they’re very very good at it”. Senior ex-Mormon Simon Southerton has been involved in a complaint to the Australian Charities and not-for-profits Commission about the church’s tax practices.

I’ll be publishing this every Sunday so in between posts be sure to listen to the Equity podcast and hear Alex Wilhelm Natasha Mascarenhas and me riff on all things startups! And if you want to have this hit your inbox directly once it officially turns into a newsletter on May 1 sign up here.

Fintech M&A hasn’t been as robust as one might expect in recent months. So when Goldman Sachs announced this week it was buying NextCapital — a fintech company that provides automated advice to corporate retirement plan participants — my ears perked up.

NextCapital was a fintech company before fintech became cool. Founded in 2013 (or 2014 depending on the source) the Chicago-based company has raised over $82 million in funding over its lifetime from investors such as FinTech Collective and Oak HC/FT according to Crunchbase.

In a statement Luke Sarsfield co-head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management said: “Employers are looking to provide their employees tailored solutions and customizable advice that can better support individual saving and investing needs to help improve retirement savings outcomes. We believe personalization represents the future of retirement savings and will drive the next wave of innovative retirement solutions.”

The move is an interesting one as the investment giant has for years been strategically scooping up fintech companies. Again according to Crunchbase Goldman Sachs has acquired 27 companies over time. Last September it announced it was acquiring buy now buy later fintech GreenSky for $2.24 billion in an all-stock deal that was a reflection of its continued push into consumer finance. That deal closed last week.

In the case of NextCapital which uses algorithms and automation to allow users to invest in retirement funds Goldman didn’t say how much it was shelling out. But CNBC reported that “the acquisition ranks among the top five asset management deals New York-based Goldman has done according to the Financial Times.”

It’s another example of an incumbent recognizing that it makes more sense to buy a company that has developed technology that it wants rather than building it out itself — a process that would take far longer and require more resources than a simple acquisition would.

Early investor FinTech Collective said it backed NextCapital at a time when robo advisors were just coming to market.

“We felt that the underlying infrastructure supporting the shift from investment product to digital advice was a more durable interesting space to be allocating capital to” the firm said in a recent newsletter.

It also noted that Goldman’s intent to buy NextCapital “follows several moves by multiline incumbents (e.g. Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan) to diversify into steadier income streams and to build out their own stacks in wealth and asset management.”

Over the years Crunchbase data indicates that Goldman has also invested in more than 900 companies and led 343 of those investments. At the height of the dot.com boom in the first quarter of 2000 the bank had invested in a record 53 startups. In Q2 of 2000 that number dipped slightly to 46. And of course by Q3 it had plunged to just 13.

Its investment activity started picking up again starting in late 2018 and the bank backed 30 startups in the fourth quarter of 2019 alone. In Q1 of this year it wrote checks to 17 companies according to Crunchbase data including to a few that TechCrunch has covered including corporate spend startup Ramp tech-enabled homebuilder Homebound and Indian food delivery giant Swiggy.

I for one will be curious to see who else Goldman backs or buys in Q2.

Fast slows its roll

Last week The Information published a piece revealing that Fast which offers a one-click checkout service for online merchants generated just $600000 in revenue in 2021. Its biggest competitor Bolt raised “roughly 50 times that figure” according to The Information.

TechCrunch last reported on Fast in January of 2021 when the startup raised a $102 million Series B financing led by Stripe. Other backers include Index Ventures Susa Ventures and Global Founders Capital. When it tried later in the year to raise a $100 million Series C financing at a valuation of over $1 billion it didn’t find any takers according to the Information.

But wait there’s more. The publication went on to report on April 1 (and no it was not an April Fool’s joke) that Fast was seeking a buyer after its failed fundraise attempt.

Reportedly the startup hired about 400 employees last year and burned through about $10 million a month for most of that period; $600000 divided by 12 = $50000 in revenue a month. Spending $10 million a month when your product is only generating $50000 in the same time frame doesn’t seem smart. As my extremely talented colleague Ingrid Lunden put it: “This is the story for a lot of startups but maybe particularly ironic when it’s a fintech startup built to process and make money…A lot of these payment companies are built precisely on economies of scale. Margins are super thin on the transactions and the tech costs a lot to build and operate which is why growth/reach/size matter.”

Add to this equation a CEO — Domm Holland — who is known for his “brash style” and had his share of controversy in Australia prior to starting Fast. Holland’s former startup Tow.com.au which aimed to be “the Uber of towing” failed in what at least one person described as a “disaster.” In February NPR published an article noting that Holland’s previous venture was embroiled “in a multimillion-dollar billing dispute with the Australian state government over towing and impounding fees that led to the startup’s liquidation in 2018.”

It added that “the way Holland has rewritten and polished his past raises questions about how far the envelope can be pushed before crossing ethical lines.”

Also according to NPR as Ilya Strebulaev a professor of finance who studies the venture capital industry at Stanford University told NPR: “Failure is not a curse. But what’s important is how the failure happened.”

So what’s next for Fast? Will Holland resign? Will Bolt scoop it up? Or will some retailer just buy its technology? Or will it just die a slow death?

TechCrunch reached out to Fast for comment. It had not responded by the time of writing.

Fundings across the globe

Funding activity seemed to pick up some this week although still not as crazy as it felt last year.

Here’s just a trio that I covered:

I got the scoop on Cross River Bank raising $620 million in a round co-led by Andreessen Horowitz — going from “tiny to mighty with a $3B+ valuation and a crypto-first strategy.”

Cross River Bank is not just any bank. The Fort Lee New Jersey-based institution is also a technology infrastructure provider that quietly powers lending and payments for many of the fintechs that top VCs are also backing — a reverse of sorts of the more common fintech-powering-bank dynamic we’re used to. As fintech has exploded in recent years so has Cross River Bank’s business — as well as investor interest.

Founder and CEO Gilles Gade told me the company which powers the likes of Affirm and Coinbase views crypto as front and center of its future efforts. Profitable since 2010 the bank is also ready for an international expansion.

Notably David George general partner of the Growth Fund at Andreessen Horowitz told TechCrunch:

When Coinbase was first starting out and looking for a partner bank many traditional financial institutions had blanket policies that prevented them from participating in crypto. Cross River on the other hand had the foresight to lean into this new frontier and support Coinbase and many other leading crypto companies who are still happy partners to this day.

I also got the exclusive on a trio of Palantir alums who just raised $25 million in a Series B led by Founders Fund for their new finance startup Mosaic. This is interesting because both Palantir and Founders Fund were co-founded by Peter Thiel.

“Mosaic is born out of our experience as CFOs and as domain experts over the past decade” CEO Bijan Moallemi said. “We are trying to create a Strategic Finance category. If you think about the way that CFOs do their work 80% of their time is mostly manual right? It’s pulling down data from disparate systems it’s doing ad hoc Excel formulas it’s often one-off analyses. Only 20% of their time is more strategic making an impact on the business.”

Mosaic wants to flip that ratio on its head.

Meanwhile I also wrote about January which wants to use technology to make debt collection a more humane and efficient process. That company just raised $10 million to keep growing.

“We started off by solving the really really hard problem of how do you collect at scale in a really compliant manner or really compassionate but still really effective manner and that enabled us to solve some of the larger problems in the industry” CEO Jake Cahan told TechCrunch. “We have to stop treating individuals like criminals and start making the system work because debt isn’t going away.”

And here’s more that either my awesome colleagues wrote or that I thought were interesting but just couldn’t get to:

Yonder a U.K.-based fintech founded in 2021 raised £20 million ($26 million) in a round led by Northzone and LocalGlobe to bring its lifestyle credit card to market. The company says its vision is to “rebuild customers’ relationship with credit.” Its three co-founders are Clearscore alumni who have pulled in talent from (Transfer)Wise and Monzo to build out Yonder’s team.

CEO Tim Chong came up with the concept soon after he moved to the U.K. from Australia and attempted to apply for a credit card. Despite having a “solid” credit history back home the best he could qualify for was an Amex with a “child-safe” credit limit and hefty fees. Yonder’s first aim is to solve the problem of access to credit cards for expats and anyone with a thin credit file with a sign-up process and credit suitability evaluation based on transaction history from daily spending habits instead of relying entirely on traditional credit checks which Chong feels are discriminatory.

Payments and infrastructure oh my

From the wonderful and oh-so-talented Christine Hall: Payment cards provider CarbonPay which focuses on sustainability now has a corporate prepaid offering called CarbonPay Business Ctrl. Visa and Stripe are powering the card and businesses can get physical cards lodge cards or virtual cards and pay using ApplePay and GooglePay in the U.S.

Whenever company employees in the U.S. and U.K. use the card their carbon footprint is offset automatically. For example for every £1 or $1.50 spent CarbonPay says it will offset 1 kilogram of carbon dioxide at no extra cost. The company keeps track of carbon footprints through a partnership with sustainability-as-a-service company ecolytiq.

Later this year CarbonPay plans to unveil another business card option and personal card offering

Our own Romain Dillet reported on how ​​Visa surprised the European fintech industry last year when it announced that it would acquire Tink for €1.8 billion ($2.15 billion at the time of the deal). Klarna now wants to compete directly with Tink with a new business unit that has its own brand — Klarna Kosma.

Like Tink Klarna offers an open banking application programming interface (API) with Klarna Kosma. Tink and Klarna are also both headquartered in Stockholm Sweden. There are other open banking API companies such as TrueLayer and Plaid. And it’s been a competitive space as Visa also tried to acquire Plaid but that deal fell through.

With this new strategy Klarna is essentially saying that it’s open for business. If you’re building a financial product and need to interact with bank accounts you have one more option.

Also Fortune reported that payments giant Adyen on March 31 announced that it is moving into providing banking services — making it a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) provider. Alex Wilhelm and I talked about how this is another example of how so many companies are realizing the value of providing infrastructure. In this case Adyen says it is launching a suite of embedded financial products that will allow platforms and marketplaces to create tailored financial experiences for their users including small business owners and individual merchants. As Alex put it: “Stripe did this but now everyone is coming for banking infra I think as a way to drive more enterprise software revenues and get away from consumer incomes.”

Meanwhile fellow fintech enthusiast Ron Shevlin in February summed it up nicely in a recent Forbes piece writing that “the rise of interest in banking as a service is the result of the growing embedded finance trend.”

In other infrastructure news…

Plaid’s CTO detailed to Ron Miller how he grew his engineering team by 17.5x in 4 years.

Cross-border payments platform dLocal is one of the most notable Latin American startups in recent history — the company became Uruguay’s first unicorn in 2020 and went public on the Nasdaq in 2021. DLocal’s founders had first launched AstroPay another digital payments platform that now has over five million users.

Now dLocal and AstroPay co-founder Sergio Fogel has teamed up with AstroPay’s former head of product Gonzalo Strauss to launch another fintech out of Montevideo Uruguay called Datanomik. Datanomik’s goal is to connect financial institutions across LatAm through its B2B open finance API which gathers a company’s banking information on one platform Strauss told TechCrunch as told by Anita Ramaswamy who is starting a crypto-focused podcast with Lucas Matney (exciting!).

As the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues one fintech startup is doing its part to help people being affected by the war.

Igor Khmel is CEO of SaveChain a new neobank for underbanked people globally to open U.S. bank accounts. Khmel tells TechCrunch that while SaveChain is still in its infancy (the company plans to launch its app by July) he wants to use its technology to help Ukrainians now by powering a new fintech-humanitarian initiative called HelpUkrainedirect which provides “Temporary Basic Income” to Ukrainian refugees via direct donations in crypto and USD.

Through its initiative HelpUkraineDirect (HUD) the company says its goal is to provide Ukrainians with direct financial relief leveraging blockchain technology and existing banking and volunteer infrastructure to pioneer a “Temporary Basic Income” (TBI) scheme for refugees via direct donor-to-refugee money distribution. The aim is to provide hard-pressed individuals with $100/month for 3-6 months according to Khmel. Crypto and tax-deductible donations can be made at https://HelpUkraineDirect.org.

Here’s a look at them.

The Siren of Sussex

By Mimi Matthews

Berkley $16 432 pp.

The Siren of Sussex is the first book in the Belles of London series. Evelyn Maltravers has one season to find a suitable husband and ensure her younger sisters’ futures. Not known for her beauty or connections she has a plan to draw the attention of prospective suitors. An accomplished equestrienne she seeks a talented tailor to create stunning riding habits that will make her outshine everyone else on the popular Hyde Park trail.

She meets Ahmad Malik after another tailor has rebuffed her. They decide to enter into a partnership — Ahmad will create one-of-a-kind riding habits and gowns for Evelyn and she will help to raise the popularity of his designs (a Victorian influencer if you will). As a mixed race man he has little entrée into society and his business needs the exposure.

As Evelyn works closely with the handsome Ahmad and her popularity rises the attraction between them also grows. But a scandal would mean the ruin of her family and of Ahmad’s fledgling business.

Matthews puts much historical detail into her emotionally rich tales. Evelyn chafes against the rigid restrictions of Victorian England and Ahmad faces racism and classism. How the two navigate their way against such adversity makes a compelling story.

The Roughest Draft

By Emily Wibberley and Austin Siegemund-Broka

Berkley $16 336 pp

Katrina Freeling and Nathan Van Huysen wrote a best seller together but their collaboration ended badly. A contractual obligation for another book forces them together once more.

Rumors had spread about an affair between Katrina and Nathan. We learn that was not true but we don’t know the reason for the bitterness between them. What happened between them four years ago is slowly revealed in flashbacks.

Writing together again in a house in Florida the two eventually ease into a wary working relationship and they give in to the excitement of their creative project. But their growing closeness raises old feelings that have never gone away.

Katrina and Nathan knew what they had was special. They were best friends and their sense of loss from their broken relationship is palpable. It is obvious to the reader that they are soul mates but Nathan was married and they never took their relationship further. Now he is divorced but Katrina is engaged.

Authors Wibberley and Siegemund-Broka are married in real life. The aching longing they reveal between Katrina and Nathan is just lovely. You root for the two to finally say face to face what is in their hearts without hiding behind their written words.

Electric Idol

By Katee Robert

Sourcebooks Casablanca $15 384 pp.

Electric Idol is the second in Katee Robert’s steamy Dark Olympus series set in modern times with mortal gods but with the same old feuds and power struggles. Her latest is a retelling of the Psyche and Eros tale. (The first book in the series Neon Gods featured Persephone and Hades.)

Psyche Dimitriou hates the glittering viper’s nest of Olympus’ upper city but she must take part in events since she is the daughter of Demeter one of the ruling Thirteen. At a party when Demeter tries to advance Psyche as a prospective bride for the new Zeus it enrages Aphrodite Olympus’ matchmaker who has her own candidate.

Psyche tries to sneak out of the party and runs into Eros Ambrosia the gorgeous son of Aphrodite. Paparazzi catch them during a close moment causing a sensation as everyone speculates they are lovers.

Eros is Aphrodite’s fixer the one who makes her problems disappear. He has become cold and emotionless full of self-loathing for being the monster his mother has made him but something about the beautiful Psyche touches him. When his mother demands he bring her Psyche’s heart he reluctantly agrees. But when he sees her again he cannot kill the innocent woman. Desperate for a solution he suggests she marry him. Though it would be a marriage of convenience they still would continue to make the residents of Olympus believe they are a love match through social media posts and then maybe Aphrodite would back off.

Of course the relationship becomes something more as the attraction between them sizzles. And the infuriated Aphrodite still has Psyche in her sights.

Electric Idol is a fun sexy reimagining of a favorite tale of mythology.

A Most Unusual Duke

By Susanna Allen

Sourcebooks Casablanca $9 312 pp

Susanna Allen’s second book in her Shapeshifters of the Beau Monde is an unexpected mash-up of historical and paranormal romance that features a duke who can transform into a bear. But it works.

Arthur Humphries Duke of Osborn has been commanded by the Prince Regent (a fellow shape-shifter) to wed Beatrice a widowed marchioness to further their species. But Arthur intends to make his marriage to the frosty human beauty one in name only. He has no intention of rebuilding his clan which dissolved years ago when a challenger killed his father.

While not pleased that she must wed again Beatrice makes the most of it and relishes getting Arthur’s abandoned decaying family home back in shape. As Beatrice’s cold facade begins to thaw as she and Arthur work together attraction grows and they begin to rethink their cold marriage. But while their connection grows an old danger returns to threaten them.

Allen blends humor and fantasy with passion for a charming twist on historical romances.

Throwback series recommendation:

There are so many good romances that I have never gotten around to reading and every once in a while I will come upon an older one that captivates me. Better yet if it’s part of a series into which I can sink into obsession. That was the case with Nalini Singh’s long-running Guild Hunter series which begins with Angels’ Blood (Berkley $8). The series follows a smart brave frankly kick-ass heroine Elena Deveraux who tracks wayward vampires. She is hired to help find a killer and is drawn into the world of the immensely powerful and beautiful archangels. Full of action horror and even tender romance it kept me spellbound. I’m still working to finish the series as written so far but I am so excited that a new book will be coming out this fall.

Speaking of old series I’m happy that Kresley Cole has returned to her Immortals After Dark after a long hiatus away from writing. Munro (Valkyrie Press $19) is the 19th installment in the paranormal romance series that features vampires lykae valkyries and angels and their struggles to find their mates amid the Accession a battle for supremacy that happens every 500 years. It’s a big enthralling world she has created full of action and passion and plenty of humor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvdGFsbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LmNvbS9hbGJ1bS1yZXZpZXdzL2hpZ2hlci1ieS1taWNoYWVsLWJ1YmxlLWFsYnVtLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""Higher"" by Michael Bublé Album Review","“Higher” by Michael Bublé – Album Review

Michael Bublé is a music institution and listening to his new album “Higher” the latest in a career that has spanned for over two decades his astonishing career is just going from strength to strength. A huge album “Higher” is essentially the sound of the Canadian superstar doing what he does best which is massive sounding songs matched with an equally massive personality.

A mix of covers and originals “Higher” is another silky-smooth sounding collection of songs from the superstar voice. It’s a voice that makes millions of fans swoon and as expected is again flawlessly silky. Opening with the upbeat pop of “I’ll Never Not Love You” it’s the kind of heart-melting song that most lesser singers can only dream of producing. Elsewhere “My Valentine” co-written with Sir Paul McCartney is a soaring piece of work while Bublé’s own version of “A Nightingale Sang in Berkley Square” has all the extravagance of a Broadway show.

A look down the tracklisting sees a healthy mix of cover tracks and collaborations on “Higher” including a collaboration with country star Willie Nelson on “Crazy” alongside Bublé’s own take on the Bob Dylan classic “Make You Feel My Love”. Of the originals “Mother” is tinged with emotion while the title track is a fantastic slice of sultry pop matched with a video premiered from outer space. On this evidence it’d be impossible to accuse the superstar of doing things by half!

The album finishes with a faithful rendition of “Smile” by Charlie Chaplin. Another wonderful reworking by Michael to finish off an album that will have his millions of fans doing just that. Of course you could say that the Canadian has done no different than he has done for the last twenty-odd years but it’s a formula that has turned the singer into an icon across the world and let’s face it when your work is popular enough to be premiered from outer space you could say that it is a formula that has is and probably for the rest of his career worked pretty well for him.

Fire officials have not announced what caused the fire.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWNrZWQuY29tL2FydGljbGVfMzMyODFfMTUtcmVhc29ucy13YWxtYXJ0LWlzLWV2aWwtaW5jYXJuYXRlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Reasons Walmart Is Trash,"Behind the cold dead eyes of that yellow smiley face lurks a well of depravity.

We all know Walmart is evil for stuff like underpaying and overworking employees using sweatshop labor and plunging entire towns into the economic toilet but that’s just the tip of the corrupt iceberg. Behind the cold dead eyes of that yellow smiley face lurks a well of depravity where cutting costs is king and the people don’t matter.

15 They Could Totally Pay Their Employees Better (NeONBRAND/Unsplash) Walmart likes to claim that they can’t possibly pay their employees more without raising their everyday low prices but in 2018 Vox reported that with the $20 billion the company paid its shareholders that year they could raise wages by an entire third.

14 They Don’t Want to Pay For Security Either (Flex Point Security/Unsplash) Walmart’s commitment to keeping its payroll mercilessly low means they rely on local police to provide the security that in-house employees should annoying both the beleaguered cops and those at risk of being brutalized by them

13 Sam Walton Was Like Morally Opposed to Charity (George Bush Presidential Library and Museum/Wikimedia Commons) He said “We have never been inclined to give any undeserving stranger a free ride” and “We feel very strongly that Walmart really is not and should not be in the charity business.” It’s everyone else who should do that to support their underpaid employees.

12 They Discriminate Against Women In 2017 Walmart was found to be using gender-biased language in its job postings that discouraged women from applying to certain jobs. The company also has a long history of ignoring the needs of pregnant employees but God forbid the children should see a Willie Nelson album. Advertisement Advertisement

11 And Black People In the year of our lord 2020 Walmart announced it would discontinue its policy of locking up beauty products aimed at black consumers. The ones for white people weirdly were always free to grab.

10 And the Elderly and Disabled In 2005 CNN got ahold of a memo sent by a Walmart vice president who was “troubled” by the loyalty and dedication of the company’s “least healthy least productive associates” (seriously she said they were “more satisfied with their benefits than other segments” and “interested in longer careers with Walmart” as if that was a bad thing) and wanted to “attract a healthier more productive workforce” to avoid paying so much for health benefits. Basically if you can be discriminated against Walmart would love to do so. Advertisement Advertisement

9 They Have a Union-Busting Avengers Squad (Daniel Klein/Unsplash) Not only does Walmart have a dedicated hotline managers can call to report organizational suspicions they employ a response team ready and willing to fly out to any store at a moment’s notice to squash those rabblerousing for living wages and healthcare.

8 They Bully Employees Electronically Walmart maintains a deliberate skeleton crew to extract the most labor out of each employee which is why half of their shelves are always bare. They even have an electronic system tracking each task telling them “we should be done already or we’re taking too long” according to one employee. Advertisement Advertisement

7 They Could Be Spying On You (Aryan Singh/Unsplash) Walmart owns a patent for a system of microphones that can pick up say the sound of shoplifting or labor organization.

6 They Disrespect Historic Sites (Gorgo/Wikimedia Commons) In 2004 Walmart built a store less than two miles from the Pyramid of the Moon a revered site of ancient ruins in Mexico. Six years earlier they built a store on top of a Native American cemetery so that store is definitely haunted. Advertisement Advertisement

5 They Think They’re Above the Law (Blogging Guide/Unsplash) In 2005 Walmart Mexico executives bribed local officials with millions of dollars to drop their building and operation permit applications on the top of the pile because they apparently won’t be satisfied until Walmarts start popping up literally overnight like the cuter kind of corporate moles.

4 Illegal Logging Why Not? (Max van den Oetelaar/Unsplash) In 2007 it was uncovered that Walmart had been building furniture that was sold in its store out of wood illegally cut down in Russian conservations meant to protect Siberian tigers. Kitties you guys. Advertisement Advertisement

3 They Turned Down Free Safety Equipment (P.L./Unsplash) Walmart has gotten into hot water over the years for the lack of automated external defibrillators (you know those big suitcases hanging on the walls of various buildings with all those medical symbols on them) in their stores after people surprise surprise had heart attacks there. In 2011 a Missouri health organization offered to provide a local Walmart where a man had died of a heart attack with a free AED and they turned it down.

2 They Took Out Life Insurance Policies on Employees Many employers offer life insurance to their staff but until 1995 Walmart was taking out secret life insurance policies on even the lowest levels of their employees getting tax deductions for the premiums and cashing in when they died. We’re not saying they were intentionally working people to death but we’re not not saying that.

CLINTON Md. — A Walmart in Clinton Maryland remains closed as the business recovers from a fire that started at the structure on Friday.

According to Prince George's County Fire/EMS Department crews were sent out to the store on Branch Avenue on a report of a structure fire around 2 p.m. Friday. Responders found smoke visible from the roof. The building was evacuated.

No injuries were reported but fire crews remained on the scene checking on hot spots and working on smoke removal. A cause for the fire has not been released.

A Walmart spokesman said that they aim to reopen the Clinton location as soon as possible but could not provide a timeline for reopening.

On Thursday 40-year-old Solo the two-time Olympic gold medalist and World Cup winner was pulled over in the parking lot of the Winston-Salem Walmart Super Center.

The Walmart sells wine and beer but it's unclear what if any purchases Solo made.

Police said Solo was arrested for allegedly driving while intoxicated and resisting arrest while her two-year-old twins were in the car. She was charged with for DWI resisting arrest and misdemeanor child abuse.

Pictures reveal the North Carolina Walmart parking lot where former US soccer team goalie Hope Solo was arrested for DWI and child abuse this week

On Thursday Solo was arrested in the parking lot of a Winston-Salem Walmart Super Center or DWI resisting arrest and misdemeanor child abuse

In a statement provided to DailyMail.com Winston-Sale Police said: 'Officers with the Winston-Salem Police Department arrested Hope Amelia Stevens (Hope Solo) on Thursday March 31 2022 in the parking lot of a business located at 3475 Parkway Village Circle in Winston-Salem North Carolina.'

'Ms. Stevens is charged with Impaired Driving (DWI) Resisting Arrest and misdemeanor Child Abuse' the statement continued.

'Ms. Stevens had her two children in the vehicle with her at the time of this offense. Ms. Stevens was processed and subsequently released from the Forsyth County Law Enforcement Detention Center.

Following the arrest Solo's attorney Rich Nichols released a statement on her behalf saying there is more to the story.

'On the advice of counsel Hope can't speak about this situation but she wants everyone to know that her kids are her life that she was released immediately and is now at home with her family that the story is more sympathetic than the initial charges suggest and that she looks forward to her opportunity to defend these charges.'

Despite being hailed as a soccer icon Solo's career has been filled with controversy.

Solo first captured the world's attention at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing where her blocking skills helped bring the U.S. to the finals and ultimately beat Brazil the favorites to win.

In 2011 Solo became an icon for the sport as she played in the FIFA Women's World Cup while recovering from a shoulder injury with the team overcoming an early loss to make their way to the finals.

Despite losing to Japan on penalty kicks Solo was awarded the Golden Glove Award for her outstanding plays.

While prepping for the London Olympics the following year Solo developed a reputation as a partier later admitting in 2012 that she was actually drunk during an interview on NBC's Today Show four years earlier following her first gold medal win.

Stevens who has two twins with Solo was also arrested in 2015 for suspicion of driving while under the influence. Solo was in the car with him and briefly suspended from the team

Hope Solo once know as an icon for women's soccer and pillar to Team USA was arrested for drunk driving and child abuse on Thursday. It was the latest in a serious of drunken mishaps

Despite the controversy enveloping her Solo made a stunning performance at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup helping the US win by stopping nearly every goal against them

'I probably shouldn't tell you this but we met a bunch of celebrities [prior to appearing on the Today Show in 2008]' Solo told ESPN in 2012. 'Vince Vaughn partied with us. Steve Byrne the comedian.

'And at some point we decided to take the party back to the village so we started talking to the security guards showed off our gold medals got their attention and snuck our group through without credentials—which is absolutely unheard of.

'I may have snuck a celebrity back to my room without anybody knowing and snuck him back out. But that's my Olympic secret. When we were done partying we got out of our nice dresses got back into our stadium coats and at 7am with no sleep went on the Today Show drunk. Needless to say we looked like hell.'

She has several previous arrests including a 2014 incident in which she allegedly had a physical confrontation with her nephew. However those charges were ultimately dismissed due to a lack of cooperation from the boy a 17-year-old standing 6-foot-9 and his mother Solo's half sister.

In 2014 Solo became a media sensation for all the wrong reasons after she was arrested for assaulting her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew in their Seattle Washington home

The year was muddied for Solo after battling a doping controversy and the arrest of her fiancie Jerramy Stevens (left) who was taken into custody by police when they found Solo injured. Solo never gave a statement to police about the incident and the coupled married

Solo married former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens in 2012. He was arrested just before their wedding for investigation of assault after a disturbance involving Solo but he was not charged.

She gave birth to the couple's twins in 2020.

Solo made 202 international appearances from 2000-16 and was part of US championship teams at the 2011 Women's World Cup and the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. She was voted top goalkeeper at the 2011 and 2015 Women's World Cups.

Solo got a public warning from the US Anti-Doping Agency in 2012 after she tested positive for the banned substance Canrenone in a urine test.

Solo still played for the US Olympic team that year winning gold in London.

'I took a medication prescribed by my personal doctor for pre-menstrual purposes that I did not know contained a diuretic' Solo said in a statement in 2012. 'Once informed of this fact I immediately cooperated with USADA and shared with them everything they needed to properly conclude that I made an honest mistake and that the medication did not enhance my performance in any way.'

The star athlete had garnered a reputation as a partier between 2008 and 2012 a precursor of drunken incidents that would lead to two arrests in the years to come

Solo was expected to carry the momentum to the 2016 Rio Olympics but she ultimately choked against Sweden in the quarterfinals during penalty kicks

Canrenone is classified as a specified substance so its presence in an athlete's sample can result in a reduced sanction.

'As someone who believes in clean sport I am glad to have worked with USADA to resolve this matter and I look forward to representing my country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London' she said.

In 2014 Solo was arrested at a suburban Seattle home on suspicion of assaulting her sister and 17-year-old nephew but her attorney insisted that Solo herself was a victim in the altercation.

'Hope is not guilty of any crime' attorney Todd Maybrown told the Associated Press at the time. 'In fact our investigation reveals that Hope was assaulted and injured during this unfortunate incident. We look forward to the opportunity to present the true facts in court and to having this matter behind Hope very soon.'

Officers responded to her sister's home just before 1am on June 21 2014 after receiving a call to the emergency dispatcher that a woman at the Kirkland residence was hitting people and that she refused to stop or leave according to police.

They found Solo intoxicated and upset saw injuries on her nephew and her sister and arrested her after speaking with those present and determining that she was the primary aggressor.

In early 2015 while Solo was at a team training camp in Southern California Stevens was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in a US Soccer team van. Solo was with him at the time.

The former Seattle Seahawks tight end later pleaded no contest and was sentenced to 30 days in jail and four years on probation. Solo was suspended by US Soccer for 30 days.

'Well clearly I wasn't thinking' she told ABC in 2015. 'I mean it was a horrible choice.'

Solo was suspended for six months by the USSF in 2016 and her contract terminated after she called Sweden 'a bunch of cowards' following that nation's quarterfinal win over the Americans. Solo filed a grievance that was settled."

He seems sui generis a true American genius conjuring visions straight out of thin air. Yet the butler the ballroom and even the garrulous sofa have their sources of all kinds and they are far away from Hollywood in the French rococo art of the 18th century.

This is the premise of a mesmerising exhibition opening this week at the Wallace Collection in London. Inspiring Walt Disney aims to show the connection between French art and American animation across three centuries. It pairs objects and images with such persuasive intelligence that you perceive both in a different way. If you don’t generally love the gilded excesses of rococo clocks paintings and claw-foot tables you may well by the end be seeing them anew through Disney’s eyes.

Born in Chicago in 1901 raised in Kansas City Missouri Walt Disney first went to Paris as an ambulance driver for the Red Cross after the armistice in 1918. His love of French art set in early. The first of many films on glowing screens through the show is a bewitching sequence from his 1931 classic The Clock Store. A porcelain couple unfreeze into life before a gilded mantelpiece clock. He bows she curtseys and so the gracious dance begins to the minuet from Mozart’s Don Giovanni.

Alongside is just such a porcelain figurine intensely popular in 18th-century Paris. Immediately you see how brilliantly Disney animates the dancers using only black ink and wash turning them round and round through their moves so they seem to have both human motion and a trace of their original porcelain stiffness. It touches very deeply on the childhood dream of inanimate objects magically coming alive.

Which is the very essence of rococo art itself in a way: the impression of motion in stillness a constant sweeping dancing twisting and curving the animation of the inanimate. It is the velvet sofa with embracing arms and flirtatiously dainty feet anthropomorphised in Disney films. It is the candlestick with the plump stomach and gilded arms out-flung which becomes the butler in Beauty and the Beast. Even the very fable like Cinderella like Sleeping Beauty is of course originally French.

Elaborate French clocks chime through this show... even the tea services turn into characters

Sound arrives in 1928 Technicolor in 1932 - you can see it all developing here most particularly with Disney’s trip to France in 1935. A home movie shows Walt and his brother Roy wandering enchanted around Versailles. Very rapidly you start to see the origins of Cinderella. A drawing of a carriage in front of the palace soaring windows colossal libraries shimmering mirrors in endless recession: the visual vocabulary is there.

It is common to talk of magic as inexplicable. You can’t see how it is done. One of the most spellbinding sights at the Wallace Collection is a whole wall of graphite drawings that shows exactly how the rags-to-gown sequence in Cinderella (1950) was achieved. Her godmother scatters the fairy dust that brings about this miracle represented by literally hundreds of thousands of pencil dots increasing decreasing shifting from one drawing to the next to describe the dazzling swirl in which Cinderella transforms.

It took 24 drawings to make a single second of film. The women of Disney’s ink and paint department copied each one meticulously on to celluloid frames in colour and one of the great moments of western cinema was made.

The studios were vast the films immense collaborations. So it was with the elaborate French clocks that chime through this show the outlandish turreted vases in pistachio and gold that emerged from the Sèvres porcelain factories even the tea services that turn into characters. There were concept artists – Disney himself of course first to last but also Mary Blair who came up with the look of Cinderella and Peter J Hall and Mel Shaw who worked on the 1991 Beauty and the Beast. The entire opening scene of this film (alas cut) was based on the most famous of all rococo paintings which hangs in the Wallace Collection – Fragonard’s The Swing.

The girl soars upwards in her copious frills one shoe flying free. An older man on the right thinks he’s pulling the strings but can’t see her young lover hidden in the bushes. An animated statue of Cupid keeps the secret knowing finger to his lips. And there in the gallery is the porcelain Cupid on which Fragonard based his figure just as Disney worked from Fragonard.

The Swing eventually made it into both Tangled and Frozen II. And the most famous of all Wallace Collection paintings Frans Hal’s The Laughing Cavalier appears on the wall of the castle in Beauty and the Beast.

By the time you get to a real gold clock merry and stout with a cheerful chime it appears to have come straight out of a Disney animation even though it was made in 1730. And the table opposite an elaborate fantasia of walnut ebony and gilded bronze now seems to have ballet feet drawn up in a fancy second position. You start to see the world in a different way the hallmark of a strong exhibition.

Was Disney’s experience of French rococo art inspiration or influence vocabulary or style? The show allows you to make up your own mind. The team who made Beauty and the Beast worked only streets away in London and my sense is that they were here in this very building absorbing the art the way Disney absorbed French culture which is to say with great depth and humour. The architecture of the Beast’s castle the sweeping staircases the twinkling mirrors the Hals: they are all here at the Wallace Collection; you only have to look.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS93b2tlLWRpc25leS0xMC1mYW1pbGllcy1kaXNuZXktbGVmdC1sZWFuaW5nLXBvbGl0aWNz0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94bmV3cy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3dva2UtZGlzbmV5LTEwLWZhbWlsaWVzLWRpc25leS1sZWZ0LWxlYW5pbmctcG9saXRpY3MuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woke Disney: 10 families who are swearing off Disney due to its left-leaning politics,"Some families across the country are reconsidering their previously Disney-friendly stance in their homes or their lives — including the movies the streaming service the theme parks and other offerings from the entertainment and media conglomerate.

That's partly because Disney's CEO Bob Chapek has opposed a new bill signed into law this week by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis; it's known as the Parental Rights in Education bill.

PARENTS OUTRAGED OVER DISNEY'S PUSHBACK ON FLORIDA'S PARENTAL RIGHTS LAW

The law prohibits Florida teachers from instructing very young students — those in kindergarten through third grade — about gender identity and sexual orientation. Initially Chapek had not taken a public stance on it but some people believe he ultimately caved to a minority of far-left ""wokers"" who are upset about the new law.

Here's a tweet from the Disney company that went out this week:

But it's not just this. Disney World and Disneyland have decided to ban the use of ""gender greetings"" within their parks — so the terms ""boys and girls"" and ""ladies and gentlemen"" will no longer be uttered by employees on Disney grounds.

These instances and more of left-leaning policies are why some concerned parents grandparents and others have changed or are revising their views of Disney. Here are opinions and insights from a variety of individuals as shared with Fox News Digital this week in exclusive interviews.

'This isn't your grandmother's Disney'

Patti Garibay an Ohio-based parent and grandparent is executive director and founder of American Heritage Girls a faith-focused alternative to the Girl Scouts. She told Fox News Digital this week via email ""It is time to void your household of all things Disney.""

She explained ""Walt Disney most often cited his most important lesson as that of ‘goodwill always triumphs over evil.’ Today's Disney promotes a full spectrum of lifestyles that rarely align with the biblical values of good and evil which God calls us to.""

She continued ""It has been said before and it bears saying again ‘Walt would turn over in his grave’ to see what his beloved company has become.""

""It is time to void your household of all things Disney.""

Added Garibay ""It's no longer a safe haven for families to promote good over evil but rather an environment without a moral compass.""

Garibay also said ""Christians should wake up to the fact that this isn't your grandmother's Disney. In fact"" she said ""Disney is now devoted to confusing your children.""

Disney will 'lose on this wokeness gamble'

A Tennessee father of a 10-month-old daughter told Fox News Digital ""As a new father I have decided not to expose my baby to any of Disney's products — anything they stream or the theme parks. There are so many other wholesome options for her.""

He also said that in time ""I will let her watch the older Disney films on DVD that I was raised on — they taught values that kids need and can understand things like loyalty friendship working through obstacles and the love of family.""

He added ""Disney doesn't seem to understand that parents have so many options now. Ultimately I think they're going to lose on this wokeness gamble.""

‘You can't promote innocence and sex at the same time'

A mother and grandmother in her early 60s who lives outside Boston Mass. told Fox News Digital in an email on Thursday ""I gave up on Disney years ago when they started opening the parks up for gay pride activities while families were there.""

I'M A MOM AND I'M SAYING GOODBYE TO DISNEY

She added ""A children's theme park is no place for this. You can't promote both innocence and sex at the same time. This was a clear signal to families about where they are headed as a company.""

She also noted ""As a Christian grandmother my job is to protect guide and love."" She said that ""participating in anything Disney forces me to abandon all three.""

‘Parents are deeply frustrated’

Kelly Claggett a mother and owner of The Local Farm to Table & Venue in Grove Oklahoma shared with Fox News Digital ""Parents are deeply frustrated because we have to fight so hard to raise our kids with important values like honesty integrity and learning the Golden Rule.""

""The executives at Disney [must] live in some kind of bubble and don't know everyday moms and dads like us.""

She also said ""Disney used to offer us wonderful content that reinforced good values. When I read about ‘woke Disney’ my friends and I all felt the same way — clearly the executives at Disney live in some kind of bubble and don't know everyday moms and dads like us.""

DISNEY EXPANDING OPERATIONS TO 10 ANTI-GAY COUNTRIES REGIONS AS THEY GO ‘WOKE’ IN THE US

She said that as a result ""They are losing our families' business and that of almost everyone I know."" Claggett said her family ""is actively looking for and watching alternatives like ‘The Tuttle Twins’ that fill in where Disney is leaving off.""

‘They’ve tarnished their brand'

A New Jersey-based wife sister and aunt who has long loved watching Disney films and visiting Disney theme parks said ""For conservatives who are longtime Disney fans the company's sharp left turn presents a real conundrum.""

""We are done and will not be funding that [Disney] machine any longer.""

She added ""Do I love Disney films stories and art? Yes. Do I love the theme parks? Absolutely. To me the theme parks drip with creativity and story and as a creative person I gravitate to that.""

She admitted that for her ""some of this probably comes down to pure nostalgia.""

However she added ""Do I love their politics? No! They've tarnished their brand with their most recent political activism targeting Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act — a bill most Americans support.""

Yet she still wishes for the best. ""My hope"" she said ""is that the company comes to its senses remembers who their customers are and gets back to doing what they do best: Entertain ‘dreamers of all ages.’""

‘Our children are going through enough’

A mom of a young daughter in the Virginia Beach area of the Old Dominion State shared that her husband — a military man — was against Disney and its products and services even before she was.

""He said ‘Absolutely not’ about anything Disney-related even before this garbage came out"" the mom said.

""I think that was the last straw for me as well with Disney"" she continued. ""Our children are going through enough. They don't need the woke culture to destroy their innocence.""

She added ""We are done and will not be funding that [Disney] machine any longer. I am also going to be disconnecting Disney+ in our household.""

Disney's woke content 'isn't the first and won't be the last challenge that Christian parents face'

""As a Christian father of three"" said James Spencer PhD president of the D.L. Moody Center in Northfield Mass. ""I am always concerned that my children may be seeing hearing and believing stories that will lead them away from Christ and distract them from proclaiming the gospel.""

""Let’s show our kids what it means to hold our convictions in the midst of a fallen world.""

He added ""While I’ve not gone so far as to ban television in our home I do spend time talking with my kids about what they are reading and viewing so that they don’t begin to trust Disney Paramount Netflix or Hulu more than they trust the Scriptures.""

DISNEY EMPLOYEE'S DIRE WARNING ABOUT CONSEQUENCES OF ‘LEFTWARD LURCH’

""Disney’s ‘woke’ content may pose a new challenge"" he also said ""but it isn’t the first and won’t be the last challenge that Christian parents face.""

He advised the following: ""Christians would do well to come together to tell an alternative story centered on the life death resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ. Disney may be contributing to a new story that denies and diminishes God — but they aren’t the first to contribute nor will they be the last.""

He also said ""As we consider how to cultivate a vibrant faith in Jesus in the next generation of the church we must remember that the Christian faith is not something we simply know but something we live out.

‘Going to Disney is something I'll never do again'

A father of two in the New York City area — and the son of a U.S. Army veteran — has taken his kids to Disney World in Orlando a few times in the past.

He said this week ""I think placating a small subset of the loudest [Disney] employees who obviously haven't even read the Florida bill sets a really dangerous standard. But it's the same standard"" he added ""that we've seen from progressives over the last 20-30 years. In this scenario the loudest squeakiest most annoying wheel gets the grease.""

This father also said ""The fact that some higher ranking Disney employees are openly saying they're going to make sure that at least 50% of the characters are LGBTQIA — when that subset of our society is less than 10% and probably less than 5% — means that I'll make sure I watch every single thing fully before my kids watch it or I'll just do away with Disney as an entity to save myself time.""

""Who would have ever thought that Mickey would turn politically correct? But apparently he has with a vengeance.""

He added ""Between this and the stupid prices for worsening experiences at their parks the traditional family ‘plan’ of going to Disney is something I'll never do again.""

This father also said bluntly ""It's a shame because my son — who's in kindergarten this year — wanted to go. But it's not worth the money much less so if Disney's DEI [diversity equity and inclusion] initiatives mean I'll have to deal with Disney ‘princesses’ who have penises.""

Mickey Mouse ‘turned politically correct with a vengeance’

Judge Phil Ginn is a father of four daughters and president of Southern Evangelical Seminary (SES) in Charlotte N.C. He told Fox News Digital in an email ""Who would have ever thought that Mickey would turn politically correct? But apparently he has with a vengeance.""

""They've chosen to engage in the destruction of the childhood of those they seek to entertain.""

He added ""What is really sad though is that instead of focusing on real atrocities such as what is happening in the kingdom of Disney’s ‘blood brother’ the Chinese Communist Party they have chosen to engage in the destruction of the childhood of those they seek to entertain.""

Ginn said that Disney's ""destructive notions of hedonistic concepts of sexuality would make even Uncle Walt blush.""

""Maybe it’s time"" he added ""for true Christians to break some bad habits about how we spend our money for entertainment — and speak out against the creeping evil in our culture not only with our words but our pocketbooks as well.""

Kids need 'a refuge from this crazy culture'

Trent Talbot a father of two in Houston Texas is founder and CEO of BRAVE Books as well as the author of ""The Fight for Freedom Island.""

He told Fox News Digital ""Disney has surrendered to the woke mob and is using its platform to indoctrinate the children of America into becoming the woke activists of tomorrow.""

Marjorie Taylor Greene a Republican from Georgia. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has accused the Walt Disney Co. of sexualizing children.

Greene also owns up to $45000 worth of Disney stock.

Congress is actively debating whether to ban federal lawmakers from trading stock.

Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene this week accused Walt Disney Co. of sexualizing children after the entertainment giant criticized a Florida education law that critics have dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill — and vowed to fight against it.

""It's hard to believe that Disney Walt Disney the Walt Disney Co. would be the very place that this is happening"" she said during an interview with Infowars broadcaster and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. ""This is supposed to be the happiest place on Earth a place where innocence is celebrated. But it seems to be the place where innocence is actually under attack.""

Greene added: ""Walt Disney — they need to pay a serious price for this.""

What Greene didn't mention is that she is a Disney investor according to personal financial disclosures filed with the Clerk of the House of Representatives.

Entering 2021 Greene owned between $1001 and $15000 in Walt Disney Co. stock her most recent annual financial disclosure indicate.

Greene subsequently added Disney stock to her portfolio. She purchased shares valued at between $1001 and $15000 on August 31 2021 and then more shares valued in the same range on November 15 2021 congressional records show. By law members of Congress are only required to disclose the value of their assets in broad ranges.

When asked by Insider about her Disney stock Greene declined to address her ownership. The congresswoman said in an email Friday that ""anyone who opposes anti-grooming laws like the one in Florida is pro-child predator. Stop sexualizing children.""

In September Greene told Insider: ""I have an independent investment advisor that has full discretionary authority on my accounts. I do not direct any trades.""

Greene who regularly buys and sells individual corporate stocks did not say whether she provided general guidance to her advisor such as whether to avoid buying certain kinds of stocks.

She also did not address questions of whether members of Congress should be allowed to buy and sell individual stocks in the first place — an issue that the Committee on House Administration is scheduled to debate on April 7 at a public congressional hearing.

The issue of federal lawmakers and their stock trades has heated up following publication of Insider's ""Conflicted Congress"" project which in December found that dozens of lawmakers and at least 182 senior congressional staffers had failed to comply with the financial reporting requirements of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012.

""Conflicted Congress"" also found numerous examples of conflicts of interest including that four members of Congress or their spouses have either currently or recently invested money in Russian companies at a time when Russia has invaded Ukraine.

'Secretly profiting'

Jennifer Strahan one of several candidates challenging Greene in Georgia's 14th District Republican primary slammed Greene for her ownership of Disney stock.

""Rep. Greene's hypocrisy seems to know no bounds"" Strahan told Insider. ""This is just another in a long list of examples of her having a strong public opinion to garner attention but secretly profiting off of the opposite.""

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on March 28 signed into law legislation officially known as the Parental Rights in Education bill. The law will limit teachers' instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity is now law in Florida. It's set to take effect on July 1.

While defenders say it will apply only to teachers of students in kindergarten through third grade critics say the bill may extend further because it contains ambiguous language banning such instruction ""in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate.""

DeSantis signed the bill publicly during a ceremony and press conference at a charter school in Spring Hill Florida saying there had been ""a nationwide trend to cut parents' out of their children's education.""

""In Florida we not only know that parents have a right to be involved we insist that parents have a right to be involved"" said DeSantis who is up for reelection this year as he stood behind a lectern that read ""Protect Children Support Parents.""

The lawmakers' scorn comes after Disney publicly opposed Florida 's new parental rights bill which bars instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. Those opposed to the legislation including Disney have dubbed it the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill saying the law is hurtful to LGBTQ rights and inclusiveness.

However the Florida law doesn't actually contain the word ""gay"" but states that ""classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.""

FLORIDA REPUBLICANS CONDEMN 'WOKE' DISNEY URGE MORE BOYCOTTS BY CONSERVATIVES AGAINST THE 'ACTIVIST MACHINE'

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Scott Perry R-Pa. told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement that ""Disney's opposition to a common-sense parental rights law exposes its disturbing effort to push the radical left's toxic 'woke' agenda on our country's most vulnerable our young children.""

""The radical left will stop at nothing to indoctrinate America's children with their woke ideology. Corporations like Disney should listen to parents and reject the left's disturbing obsession with sexualizing our children"" Rep. Jody Hice R-Ga. told Fox News Digital.

""Far-left radicals are working to infiltrate and control every corner of our lives. After taking over Disney’s corporate boardroom their woke agenda is now being strategically woven into our children’s entertainment. Disney’s actions will do immeasurable harm to our innocent young children by prematurely exposing indoctrinating and even sexualizing them with ‘gender orientation’ and perverse sexuality"" Rep. Bob Good R-Va. said.

""Disney needs to get back to wholesome entertainment and remember who their paying audience is – parents of young children not radical educators legislators or woke activists"" Good added.

Rep. Ralph Norman R-S.C. said: ""While Disney expands its media empire in China where human rights abuses are ignored and other anti-gay nations they caved to pressure by the left and publicly opposed a bill that protects children 4-8 years old from being indoctrinated with woke gender theory. They're literally taking the position that children should learn about sexual orientation and gender identity before formal education on what sex even is.""

Disney recently announced it is expanding its media empire into at least ten anti-gay countries despite its strong stance against Florida's parental rights bills.

Rep. Mary Miller R-Ill. added ""I applaud Republicans in Florida for taking a stand for parents everywhere. There is no trend more disturbing than the left's push to talk to very young children about their sexuality and indoctrinate them with radical gender ideology. Parents are horrified by this and conservatives must protect children from this extreme agenda!""

Disney this week said it will work to repeal the legislation in Florida because it's dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of the LGBTQ+ community.

""Florida’s HB 1557 also known as the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill should never have passed and should never have been signed into law"" Disney said in a statement. ""Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that."""

Discovery Merger,"Ahead of the Warner Bros. Discovery merger AT&T and Discovery Communications shareholders have decisions to make.

Recently Discovery Communications (DISC.A) (DISC.B) (DISCK) shareholders officially approved the merger with WarnerMedia AT&T's (T 0.83%) soon-to-be spun-off company. The resulting company will be Warner Bros. Discovery and begin trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker ""WBD"" in early April. Before the new company forms here's what AT&T and Discovery Communications shareholders need to know.

What happens if you own AT&T?

AT&T's WarnerMedia will represent 71% of the newly formed Warner Bros. Discovery and its shareholders will receive approximately 0.24 shares of the new company for each share of AT&T stock owned. Before that happens you will have the opportunity to decide whether you want to own just AT&T or Warner Bros. Discovery or both companies.

If you own AT&T stock at the end of trading on Monday April 4 you will receive two temporary stocks in addition to your AT&T ""T"" stock before the market opens on Tuesday April 5. If you sell ""T"" before the merger is complete you will be selling AT&T common stock and the right to receive shares of WBD common stock.

The first temporary stock you will receive before the market opens on Tuesday April 5 is under the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ticker symbol ""T WI."" If you sell ""T WI"" you will be selling only AT&T common stock while retaining the right to receive shares of WBD common stock.

The second temporary stock you will receive before the market opens on Tuesday April 5 is under the Nasdaq symbol ""WBDWV."" If you sell ""WBDWV"" you will be selling your right to receive shares of Warner Bros. Discovery common stock while retaining your shares of AT&T common stock.

AT&T Shareholders may not have very long to decide because the recording date for the new Warner Bros. Discovery shares is at the close of business on Tuesday April 5. If you do nothing you will retain your AT&T ""T"" common stock and own Warner Bros. Discovery common stock once the merger is complete.

After the merger is complete the temporary stocks ""T WI"" and ""WBDWV"" will cease to exist and AT&T's ""T"" stock price will adjust lower to reflect the loss of WarnerMedia.

Finally WBD will not issue any fractional shares of its common stock. As a result you would receive cash compensation for any fractional shares within 10 business days of the merger.

What happens if you own Discovery Communications?

Discovery Communications will represent the remaining 29% of the new Warner Bros. Discovery company. Discovery Communications and its three share classes will no longer exist as the company unlike AT&T will fully be merged into Warner Bros. Discovery.

Immediately before the merger Discovery plans to reclassify its three share classes into one share class. Then Warner Bros. Discovery will automatically convert each share of Discovery common stock into one share of WBD common stock. Warner Bros. Discovery's stock price has yet to be finalized.

Is Warner Bros. Discovery a good investment?

Warner Bros. Discovery has guided for an impressive $52 billion in revenue in 2023 with $15 billion being direct-to-consumer (DTC) which includes popular streaming services like HBO Max and Discovery Plus. For comparison Walt Disney in its fiscal year 2021 made $50 billion in revenue with its media and distribution arm -- $16.3 billion of which was DTC revenue.

Those revenue numbers look impressive especially with Warner Bros. Discovery's estimated market cap of about $45 billion. However WBD will be saddled with $58 billion in debt out of the starting gate and the pressure to continually produce content will be costly. David Zaslav CEO of Discovery and soon-to-be CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery said Warner Bros. Discovery plans on spending $20 billion on content for 2022. If Disney is any indication that cost will only rise each year -- Disney expects to spend $33 billion for its fiscal year 2022 after spending $25 billion for its fiscal year 2021. As interest rates continue to rise it could become harder for Warner Bros. Discovery to raise capital or at the very least will increase the cost to borrow the money required to produce enough content to keep up with its competitors.

As Warner Bros. Discovery gets its footing as a newly merged company look to whether or not it can meet its revenue guidance and pay down some of its excessive debt. Until then don't expect Warner Bros. Discovery stock to be a winner just yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWFwcC1tb25leWJveC1yYWlzZXMtMDMzNTA0OTg3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UK Investment App Moneybox Raises $46M For Crypto Products,"Key Insights:

Asset manager Fidelity led the Series D investment round.

Moneybox has almost $4B in AUM and 800000 customers.

Financial regulators are putting the squeeze on UK crypto firms.

Digital wealth manager Moneybox has announced a successful Series D funding round from asset manager Fidelity. The 35 million GBP (around $US46 million) will enable the London-based firm to scale its operations and launch new crypto investment products.

Fidelity International Strategic Ventures has previously backed the firm with investments in its 2018 Series B round. Polar Capital also joined the current round for Moneybox which has almost reached $3.9 billion (3 billion GPB) in assets under management according to reports.

Crypto Investment Not Speculation

Moneybox was launched in 2016 to help people invest with their small change. The app has grown substantially offering retirement planning property buying and stock investments and now has more than 800000 users.

Co-founder and co-CEO Ben Stanway is confident that crypto is the next direction for the company. Speaking to Altfi he said that the firm can now deliver on the “societal need for the mass market to have wealth planning savings and services made available to them.” He explained that the app will not offer crypto trading but will focus on portfolio diversification.

“We’re going to be expanding [into crypto] through the lens of diversification not through the lens of speculation”

He added an example of suggesting holding “a couple of percent” in Bitcoin [BTC] as part of a more extensive portfolio reiterating that “We will not be a good place for people to speculate on cryptocurrencies.”

Stanway said that the crypto investment plans were still in the early stages of development adding that there was likely to be “just Bitcoin or maybe Bitcoin and perhaps one or two others” to begin with.

The company’s long-term goal is to offer financial planning services to as many as 15 to 20 million Brits who would benefit from such planning.

UK Regulators Tighten the Leash

The move comes under increasing gloomy skies for crypto regulation in the United Kingdom. The Bank of England and financial regulators have taken a harsh stance toward cryptocurrencies and plan to further restrict and regulate businesses in the sector.

As a result many U.K. firms are already seeking friendlier jurisdictions in Europe such as Switzerland and Croatia. Industry experts have warned of a potential exodus of talent and innovation from the country.

Last week the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) extended the deadline for registering crypto asset businesses for 12 companies but it has since passed for the rest of them.

The new owners also have generations of experience.

EVERETT — Are you a Snohomish County resident? The odds are good you’ll generate three tons of garbage yard waste and recycling this year.

Somebody’s got to pick that up.

For more than a century Rubatino Refuse Removal has been collecting the city of Everett’s trash. It’s been a long haul for the Rubatino family which founded the business in 1907.

Late last year the Rubatinos sold the disposal company to three partners: Stephan Banchero III president of Cedar Grove a Seattle-based organic composting company; Darrick Dietrich president of Pasco-based Basin Disposal; and Marc Torre president of Sunshine Disposal in Spokane.

Together they formed a new ownership group independent of their respective companies.

“The three of us came together separately to make the purchase” Banchero said.

The terms of the deal were not disclosed.

All three buyers are from families that have been in the trash collection business for generations since the late 1930s.

They’re exactly the kind of buyers that 91-year-old Edward Rubatino who joined the family business in 1957 was searching for when he decided to sell the 114-year-old company.

Ed who worked full-time as president through December had spent 64 years on the job.

“My father wanted to keep the business as a family business” said Rose Rubatino Goulet Ed Rubatino’s daughter and a former fourth-generation business owner.

“We just feel that the community is really taken care of in a special way with a family-run business versus an international corporation” Rubatino Goulet said.

The fifth generation has taken a different route Rubatino Goulet said.

“One of my sons is a physician and one sells outdoor equipment.”

On January 1 the new owners took over the Everett company keeping the Rubatino name.

“From a look and feel perspective the business will stay similar” Banchero said. “We look forward to making Everett a solid waste model.”

All the employees continue with the company. Rubatino Goulet retains her part-time position at the firm. Before the sale the business employed about 50 people she said. Many members of the Rubatino family including her husband Larry Goulet have “proudly worked for the business for many many years” she said.

“We’re proud of our relationship with Everett” Rubatino Goulet said. “We want to thank our customers for their loyalty and the support of our company.”

One big family

“The solid waste industry is one big family” said Banchero 39. “We’re a couple of Italian families that go way back. The Rubatino family knew my dad and my grandfather.”

Banchero’s grandfather founded a Seattle garbage collection business in 1938. For years it operated under the name Seattle Disposal.

In 1988 the family invested in an organic recycling facility in Seattle’s Maple Valley. Eleven years later they sold the garbage portion of the business. In 2004 they added a second recycling facility Cedar Grove in Everett.

“We take food and yard waste and turn it into compost” Banchero said.

“Ed wanted to keep the business within a family-owned structure. We were able to provide that” Banchero said. “We are honored to carry the torch for their family and to make them and the city of Everett proud for a long time.”

Darrick Dietrich’s grandfather John Dietrich began hauling garbage in Pasco and Pendleton Oregon when he was 19 years old. A few years later John Dietrich and his brothers bought a trash collection company and moved it to Pasco.

“For Ed what matters most is that we take care of Everett” said Dietrich 50 who travels to the city twice a month. “If he had sold it to a corporation they would have managed it from afar through multiple managers.”

The Torre family started its King County trash collection business in 1938 with horses and wagons said Torre 50 who grew up in Kent.

“We’ve all known each other for a long time” Torre said. “This is an effort to continue the family business. We look forward to providing a high level of service.”

Horse and cart

Three main waste haulers collect trash in Snohomish County: Rubatino Refuse in Everett; Waste Management in Arlington Bothell Brier Edmonds and outside other Snohomish County cities; and Republic Services in Edmonds Lynnwood Snohomish and some east county areas.

Rubatino is the oldest.

Angelo Rubatino and two partners founded the business during a winter “when there was no work” at the Black Diamond coal mines where he worked Rubatino Goulet said of her great grandfather.

Henry Rubatino standing next to his horse and wagon date unknown. (Rubatino family photo)

“They got a horse and started picking up trash” she said.

The Newcastle mines located in the Cascade Range foothills of King County were largely worked by immigrants from Italy and Wales according to historylink.org

“The work was hard and dangerous and those who could went on to other enterprises” wrote Rita Cipalla who chronicled a history of the mines and miners.

Angelo discovered an out.

A year later in 1908 Angelo asked his son Henry to join the business after the two partners left. They named it H. Rubatino Company doing business as City Scavengers. Around that time Everett which had incorporated in 1893 was a city of 25000 residents a quarter of whom were foreign-born.

Known as the “City of Smokestacks” Everett was dominated by 95 manufacturing plants “including 11 lumber mills 16 shingle mills and 17 mills producing both” according to historylink.org.

Angelo and his son Henry acquired two carts and four draft horses.

“Occasionally the horses would get away running wild in the neighborhood dragging their harnesses” according to one Everett history “In those days garbage men were junk men too. They collected metals glassware and other items. The garbage was hauled to Bayside and barged out into Puget Sound and dumped.”

Drivers pitched in to help fill the city’s potholes Rubatino Goulet said. On trash runs they would pick up “coal clinkers” hard chunks of burnt coal which they used to fill the divots in the road she said.

The Rubatino’s horse and cart likely shared the road with Everett’s Bargreen Coffee Co. which began delivering beans in a horse-drawn wagon in 1898 and the Macomber Farms delivery wagon. Founded in 1906 Macomber is still going strong today.

Later Henry’s brother Fred joined the business and then his son Tom “and then my dad Ed and then me” Rubatino Goulet said.

In 1937 the Rubatinos replaced the horses with a fleet of garbage trucks. It caused a bit of commotion among the company’s drivers Rubatino Goulet said.

Suddenly they had to learn their routes she said. Until then they relied on the horses to turn onto the right street and pull up to the right house.

“The horses had just known where to stop” she said.

The company continued to operate under the name City Scavengers until 1967 when it was changed to Rubatino Refuse Removal. Scooter service began in 1968. The zippy little scooters that can navigate tight alleyways and side streets are old “meter maid trucks that have been stretched and modified” Rubatino Goulet said.

Disposable consumerism

Until the 19th century Industrial Revolution the small amount of household waste produced was “mostly organic such as food scraps” according to a 2021 Snohomish County report.

“Clothing was patched until it was no longer wearable and then the scraps were used as rags or sewn together for other uses” the report said.

The advent of disposable mass-produced consumer goods — from shoes to paper napkins — boosted the amount of garbage produced by a single household.

Private companies unearthed a lucrative niche hauling trash.

Smaller towns and villages on the other hand sometimes depended on “piggeries” small pig farms to dispose of food waste. Just 75 pigs could consume about a ton of food waste each day.”

In 1880 less than a quarter of American cities had any kind of organized solid waste collection system. By the time the Rubatinos launched their business in 1907 about two-thirds of the American cities offered some sort of trash collection service.

It would be another 60 years before the United States enacted waste collection regulations. In 1965 Congress passed the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Before then waste was usually burned on site in barrels or pits or sent to landfills.

In Washington recycling services began with the 1989 passage of the Waste Not Washington Act which introduced curbside recycling.

“By the end of the twentieth century waste management had become a combination of science and art” the Snohomish County report said.

According to Rubatino Goulet her grandfather always said “You make your living in the community you give back to that community.”

Henry Rubatino was president of the Sons of Italy in Everett and served 25 years on the board of Catholic Community Service. Ed Rubatino and Rubatino Goulet also served on the board. Both are members of the Everett Rotary Club and are past presidents.

“When you have your name on the side of your truck” Ed Rubatino said “you want to do the best you can in your community.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has for the first-time proposed setting limits on the disposal of wastewater into the environment containing a family of chemicals known as PFAS.

The agency’s focus on perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl compounds can be expected to have wide-ranging effects across industries. They are ubiquitous found in numerous consumer and industrial products since the 1950s because they increase resistance to heat stains water and grease.

The EPA has initially targeted discharges from sites in the organic chemical plastics and synthetic fibers industries that manufacture PFAS. It also determined that effluent limitations guidelines (ELGs) are warranted for the metal polishing industry to address PFAS discharges from chromium electroplating facilities. The EPA’s move to rein in PFAS in wastewater is part of a broader policymaking effort to reduce their presence in drinking water because of their links to adverse health effects.

Limiting PFAS in wastewater will be a challenge. After all these substances do not break down in the environment. At the same time industries are dealing with tighter discharge limits on nitrogen phosphorus and other contaminants.

Regulations to protect the environment and public health and safety often encourage innovation and that is exactly what industry needs to solve these real-world problems. It was only 50 years ago that a South African civil engineer by the name of James Barnard began to consider ways to use microorganisms — biology — to remove nitrogen and phosphorus from used water. Up until then the standard practice was to use chemicals to remove these nutrients.

Today biological nutrient removal is used in thousands of wastewater treatment plants around the world in many varied climates. Barnard's discovery has sparked new concepts of nutrient removal and water reuse pioneered by advancements in biotechnology.

A boost from biotech

Biotechnology often gets a bad rap because of its links to social concerns about genetically modified foods. But there is much more to biotechnology. One of the most promising uses of biotechnology is actually waste management.

Advanced biotechnology allows for biological solutions to traditional water and waste-treatment challenges such as sludge management degradation of recalcitrant compounds and biogas generation. It also helps users implement more sustainable wastewater treatment systems. In the water business we like to call that a “win-win.”

Biological treatment of wastewater spans many industries from food and beverage to petroleum because of the generation of organic pollutants. However many pollutants especially highly complex chemical compounds are not efficiently degraded by microorganisms or are resistant to biodegradation and can compromise water quality. This is where bioaugmentation helps.

Bioaugmentation is the practice of adding actively growing specialized microbial strains that can enhance treatment performance as well as help biodegrade recalcitrant molecules in the polluted environment. These beneficial microorganisms are the vitamin supplements of the wastewater industry. If your body is low on Vitamin D for example it is cheaper and more efficient to take a supplement than to spend more time in the sun.

Bioaugmentation strategies also are appropriate for our current times. We live in a world where everyone wants it ‘their way” influenced by algorithms that personalize experiences.

Microbial and enzymatic solutions deliver more customized treatments tailored to the exact conditions of a wastewater plant. Customers are looking for individualized solutions because biological treatments are sensitive to any changes in the plant environment including temperature oxygen levels and organic concentrations.

For example surfactants are necessary for cleaning in almost all industrial facilities but they can cause serious problems at wastewater treatment plants. In high enough concentrations they can cause foaming and lead to floc disruption. If surfactants pass through to the effluent they can lead to permit violations and surcharges. They can also cause effluent toxicity problems. Surfactants are degradable but the right microorganisms have to be present and functional for this to happen.

Bioaugmentation has been shown to increase the treatment efficiency of a range of compounds including ammonia fats oils and grease. Ammonia removal is one of the most important and difficult processes to maintain in wastewater treatment plants. It can be impacted by various environmental factors shock loading toxicity and solids loss. Success or failure of the process depends on the ability of the microbial community to degrade ammonia tolerate harsh conditions and respond quickly after nitrification disruptions.

Another benefit of bioaugmentation is that it can target specific compounds such as hydrocarbons and phenols which are common pollutants in the refining and petrochemical industries but not easily degraded by the indigenous microbial populations in the wastewater facilities at those sites. To compensate for poor biological activity these facilities use powdered activated carbon to absorb undegraded contaminants which increases the cost of operations.

Sustainability is the path forward

As scrutiny intensifies about more complex contaminants such as PFAS pharmaceuticals pesticides and other recalcitrant compounds found in industrial wastewater regulators and industry seek not just efficient remediation options but also environmentally sustainable ones. Indeed with the rapid increase of industrialization and urbanization worldwide driving demand for more clean water sustainability has become a priority in wastewater management to address the growing worldwide demand for clean water. Because supplies of fresh water are limited the industry is increasingly looking at recycled water as an important strategy to ensure sustainable operations.

Biotech is already playing a role in reducing the environmental footprint of wastewater treatment. Examples include biological solutions that help reduce dredging costs and improve wastewater lagoon capacity and products that enhance anaerobic digestion to help increase biogas yield reduce solids generation and support healthy digester operation. These products allow customers to shift their operations to be more sustainable reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and assist them in producing cleaner water.

We may be just scratching the surface of environmental biotechnology’s potential to kickstart a fundamental shift toward more sustainable solutions in the water and waste industries. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals are helping drive urgency to convert laboratory-scale operations into economically viable industrial-sized equivalents.

At Univar Solutions sustainability is more than an aspiration. Our approach to delivering next-generation sustainable solutions is core to how we conduct business today and into the future. Like many companies our commitment to a forward-thinking and holistic sustainability journey supports our efforts to help keep global communities healthy clean fed and safe. Sustainability will continue to be an important driver for industrial water treatment worldwide.

However is this causing us to dig ourselves into a growing hole of issues? We examine the biggest environmental problems caused by mining.

—

The mining and processing of minerals provides us with the building blocks required to form much of the infrastructure needed to support modern societies. In 2020 the top 40 mining companies had together accumulated a total revenue of USD$544 billion which was up 4% on the previous year. Whilst demand for some resources such as coal is falling other resources such as copper are seeing increasing demand as new products and technologies require different materials. For example a single lithium-ion electric vehicle battery pack (a type known as NMC111) uses around 16kg of lithium 46kg of nickel 46kg of cobalt and 43kg of manganese.

However the process of mining remains intense and invasive and operations often leave large environmental impacts on the local surroundings as well as wider implications for the environmental health of the planet.

Water Use in Mining

Mining and mineral processing operations often have high water footprints as many stages require the use of water. Examples include dust mitigation removing soluble particles sieving and separation processes and in creating tailings dams for waste management. Although some stages such as the separation of minerals can reuse and recycle the water other stages such as spraying to remove airborne dust will lead to pollution of the water preventing water from being recycled. High water use in mining operations can lead to reduced access for local people to uncontaminated freshwater supplies and can result in a local area suffering from water stress.

However compared to other industries mining has a relatively small water usage and often a large fraction of the water used is saline so does not have much use in other industries or domestically. For example the US has one of the highest rates of mineral production in the world after China and Australia; however the water used for mining only makes up about 1% of the total national water use with 47% of this water being low quality saline water.

Mining Pollution

There have been many documented instances of environmental pollution caused by mining operations which are often caused by leakages of mining tailings. Mining tailings are the materials left behind after the economically valuable fraction of material has been extracted. These materials are often stored in large tailings dams to prevent environmental damage as tailings are often radioactive toxic or acidic. Tailings consist of valuable substances used in the extraction process such as cyanide mercury or arsenic; therefore modern mining programmes often aim to remove these harmful but valuable chemicals to reuse for further mineral separation. In addition to improving efficiency and cutting costs this minimises the risk of environmental damage by reducing the toxicity of the tailings.

As a result of strict international regulations pollution caused by mining has been dramatically reduced; however it is still an ongoing problem in many developing countries where illegal small-scale operations known as ‘artisanal mining’ occur. These low-tech subsistence mining operations are often unsafe and the poor management of sites leads to environmental pollution in the region. The problems associated with artisanal mining remain complex as it is difficult to identify and shut down all of these small operations. Furthermore although artisanal mining can result in dangerous environmental pollution it does help to alleviate the estimated 40 million people who participate in this industry from poverty.

How Does Mining Impact the Land?

Another key environmental problem associated with mining projects is the land use change that occurs not only from drilling and excavating open pit mines but also the changes that occur as result of the development of surrounding infrastructure. The latter can include camps to provide accommodation for the miners as well as the railways and roads needed to transport the mined materials. The infrastructure created by mining operations in remote untouched landscapes can lead to improved access to these regions which may result in further human-caused disturbance to the local ecological systems.

The impact of mining operations on the surrounding land is also closely linked to the ecological setting of the mining sites. For example the deforestation of primary forests caused by mining for iron ore in the tropical rainforests of Gabon is likely to leave more devastating and longer term ecological damage compared to mining iron ore in the deserts of northern Australia.

A village was set up to support 15000 miners working in the ruby mine near Ambatondrazaka Madagascar. Photo: Pardieu et al. (2017).

However compared to many other industries such as agriculture mining uses relatively small pockets of land and the future of mining could move to using techniques that are arguably even less invasive on the environment by using less land and emitting less pollution. Methods could include underground mining where ore is extracted below the surface with little waste and minimal ecological scarring of the Earth’s surface; phytomining where plants accumulate high concentrations of metals which can then be processed; or even asteroid mining where materials from asteroids could be harvested for their use on Earth.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Mining

It is also important to consider the impact of land use change in the context of greenhouse gas emissions. The destruction of vegetation and soils when land is cleared for mining results in the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Another important consideration relates to the quantity of greenhouse gases released per unit mass of mined material as some less concentrated mineral deposits require proportionally higher energy usage. For example mining a kilogram of diamond produces around 800000 kg CO2e compared to a kilogram of a highly abundant mineral such as iron which produces only about 2 kg CO2e.

The creation of products from mined materials uses high amounts of energy throughout the different stages of the production chain and most of this energy is currently sourced from the burning of fossil fuels.

Reducing reliance on fossil fuels in the mining process by electrifying the technology and running it off a green energy grid is a key aim to allow mining to continue along a more sustainable path. Automation of many of the stages of mining is also another vital change that will not only improve safety but also increase efficiency and cut energy costs. However it will remain difficult to swiftly transition the mining industry into becoming a net zero emitter and with the short supply of many rare earth metals it is crucial to reuse and recycle mined materials wherever possible.

Looking Ahead

Overall when considering the environmental ramifications of mining it is important to weigh up the social and environmental damages caused by extracting the minerals against the benefits gained from the use of the final product. As consumers it is important that we are aware that our personal decisions to purchase new products containing finite mined materials are associated with high water use land use pollution and the release of greenhouse gases.

Mining of further resources is required to support the growing global population and allow for the creation of green infrastructure and renewable energy generation. It is vital that governments and companies continue to innovate to create clean mining technologies with strict environmental regulations which will enable the mining industry to pave the way for a sustainable and hopeful future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjMTduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDQvMDIvbWlkLW1pc3NvdXJpLXdhc3RlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtY2VudGVycy1oZWxwLWNvbW11bml0eS1tZW1iZXJzLXdpdGgtc3ByaW5nLWNsZWFuaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mid-Missouri waste management centers help community members with spring cleaning,"COLUMBIA MO (KMIZ)

Columbia and Jefferson City is starting off April with some spring waste cleaning and collections.

Every first and third Saturday from April until November community members will get to drop off household hazardous waste items free of charge in Columbia.

This Saturday was the first day community members could drop off household hazardous waste items at sites in the city.

The collection took place at the site on Lakeview Ave. between 8 a.m. and noon Saturday. The city’s volunteers said about 300 vehicles stopped by on Saturday but that's a slow day for them. They said they usually see anywhere between 400 to 500 vehicles dropping off items.

Once individuals drive up they will be met by volunteers and split into two lines depending on the items they have. The allowed disposable items range from motor oil paints aerosol cans and ammunition.

The collection facility recycled paint can also save you money. A small crew of people stir the multiple cans of latex paint to check for solids. If none is found the paint is put into five-gallon buckets and is later given to residents for free.

According to paintzen a gallon of paint can cost up to $40 for quality paint equalling a potential $200 savings.

Steve Moore is one resident who drove 20 miles from Harrisburg to drop off items. He said he wanted to set an example for his daughter. ""Teaching her that it's better to take care of our environment than just throwing stuff out is much better” Moore said.

Brenda Peculis is one individual who said she been volunteering at the HHW Facility for about two years to show her dedication to helping the environment.

“When they just throw things into the landfill  critters go through landfill they drag things out. It rains the water washes all of that nasty stuff into the ground and it ends up in our water supply so we end up drinking everything we throw away to some degree” Peculis said.

Laura Cooper is new to Columbia and says she was amazed by the accessibility.

“We just loaded up some paint that the previous owners had left in our basement and um a container of antifreeze and we pulled right up and they took it"" Cooper said.

If you are in Jefferson City their bulky-item pick up will be Monday if you live on west side of Highway 54 and April 11 if you live on the east side.

Items can be placed on the curb no earlier than the Sunday before your scheduled pick-up date and no later than 5 a.m. on Monday. You will only be allowed to bring large items such as TV’s and furniture to your curb for pick up.

For a $10 monthly fee participants can drop food scraps at the Millfair Compost and Recycling Center on Millfair Road where they are collected for composting at a commercial facility in Saegertown.

The goal is to reduce greenhouse gases emitted by foods as they decompose in a landfill.

And participants may be able to recoup the out-of-pocket cost by reducing the amount of trash that they put at the curb.

What to do now:Erie County cancels hazardous and electronic waste collection

Millcreek Township recycling coordinator Jessica Stutzman and her family took 18 pounds of food scraps to the Millfair Road Compost and Recycling Center in the first week of the local food-composting program in March.

""We pay for unlimited trash pickup right now. But we're figuring out how much food waste we can take for composting instead and then will switch to the Pay as you Throw program. With recycling and now composting really the only things we'll be putting in our trash will be plastics that can't be recycled and broken toys"" Stutzman said.

Cost is increasing:For Millcreek trash recycling service

The Pay as You Throw program allows Millcreek Township residents to pay $7 per trash bag left at the curb rather than $87 quarterly for unlimited pickup by Waste Management.

How the food-composting program works

Vegetables fruits coffee grounds egg shells meat fats spoiled foods and fish generally thrown out in the trash can be set aside for composting instead.

Compostable to-go containers and cutlery known as PLA products are also accepted.

Participants can use their own container or bag to collect the food waste or buy a five-gallon bucket for $5 from Conservation Compost the private firm partnering with Millcreek Township in the food-composting program. The bucket comes with four compostable liners for the first month's service and is delivered for pickup at the Millfair Compost and Recycling Center at 2301 Millfair Road.

Additional liners are 25 cents each and are available at the Millfair Compost and Recycling Center and at the Millcreek Township Municipal Building at 3608 W. 26th St.

When the bucket is full liners are removed taken to the Millcreek Compost and Recycling Center and placed in one of two lined 65-gallon ""toters."" Conservation Compost collects the toters weekly and replaces them with new receptacles.

""We've heard a few concerns about odor and animals maybe getting into the scraps"" Stutzman said. ""But it's really no different than putting scraps in a trash toter at the curb. The toters are secure and are regularly replaced with brand new toters and clean compostable liners.""

The Millfair Compost and Recycling Center is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday from noon to 5 p.m.

The public can sign up for the program at conservationcompost.com or by calling 814-273-7044.

The goal: Reducing greenhouse gases

Food wastes are the largest components of the municipal waste stream and take up the most space in landfills.

""The average person wastes 220 pounds of food each year"" Stutzman said. ""For 53000 residents in Millcreek alone that's over 11 million pounds of food going into the landfill each year.""

New facility in ErieInternational Recycling Group finalizes purchase of 25 acres

Food wastes emit greenhouse gases as they break down including methane which is 26 to 38 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. With 100 participants Stutzman calculates that the local composting program would remove 44 metric tons of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere each month or the equivalent of removing 114 cars from the road.

""We can do a lot of good with this program"" Stutzman said.

Millcreek Township is committed to the environment township Supervisor Kim Clear said in a statement.

""With the launching of Erie County’s first municipal food waste drop-off pilot program Millcreek actively commits itself to sustainable living and takes direct action to combat climate change"" Clear said. ""Making food scrap collection and disposal easy gives everyone the power to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""

The Millcreek program is modeled on two successful food-composting programs in Ohio in Cleveland Heights and Bowling Green.

The Millfair Compost and Recycling Center is operated by Millcreek and Fairview townships and has accepted brush leaves branches and shrubbery since 2004.

Wells Fargo closed its Bristol Township location at the onset of the pandemic a move numerous financial institutions faced.

In a proposal to replace it the quick-service brand proposed to keep the structure remodel it for food service and continue it as a commercial venue.

The interior would be renovated to a one-thirds/two-thirds split between the fast-food chain and a convenience store. The bank’s drive-thru window is scheduled to remain as it is aptly suited to food service.

The inside refurbishment is not expected to offer seating; however a small outdoor seating area is under consideration.

This was a nice bounce-back game for the 76ers.

They followed up Thursday’s dismal performance against the Detroit Pistons with Saturday’s scintillating 144-114 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.

The blowout win at the Wells Fargo Center improved the Sixers’ record to 47-30 and snapped their three-game skid. They’re on the brink of clinching their fifth straight postseason berth. The Cleveland Cavaliers’ 119-101 victory over the New York Knicks denied the Sixers the opportunity to clinch on Saturday. One has to assume the Sixers could clinch the playoff nod with a win over the Cavs on Sunday evening at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.

The fourth-place Sixers and 2 ½ games behind the first-place Miami with five games remaining.

They broke the game open in the third quarter outscoring the Hornets 45-27. The 45 points tied for the second-most points the Sixers have posted in a quarter this season. They had a season-high 47 in the third quarter vs. the Orlando Magic on Jan. 19.

The Sixers went into the fourth quarter with commanding 103-80 advantage. They went on to lead by as many as 35 points.

James Harden said the Sixers’ pace the was the difference in the third quarter.

“I’m not the fastest guy so I try to advance the ball as much as I can” he said. “Tyrese [Maxey] and Tobias [Harris] allow our playmakers to push the tempo a little more ... because of that we got the shots that we really wanted.

“We have to do that more consistently.”

The Sixers also benefitted from shooting 60.9 % from the field Saturday including making 21 of 43 three-point shots. The 21 makes tied a franchise record. And the shooting percentage was aided by their 38 assists on 53 baskets.

“We know how good we can be” Joel Embiid said. “It’s all about doing it every single night. I had a lot of fun playing tonight and that’s the way we should be playing every night just sharing the ball moving playing with pace pushing the ball in transition.

“Our defense was pretty good. So we shouldn’t be doing this after a bad loss. We should do it every night.”

The Sixers lacked ball movement and struggled to make stop in Thursday’s 102-94 road loss to the struggling Pistons.

On Saturday Embiid finished with 29 points 14 rebounds and six assists while sitting out the fourth quarter. Harris added 23 points while making 5 of 9 three-pointers. Harden had 12 points a game-high 13 assists and nine rebounds in just three quarters of action. Matisse Thybulle (12 points and 3 steals) joined Embiid and Harden as starters to sit out the fourth quarter.

Maxey (19 points) and reserves Georges Niang (10) and Shake Milton (10) were the Sixers’ other double-digit scorers.

But Harden who took 10 shots (made four) appeared back in his comfort zone being more of a distributor than someone hunting for his own shot. The Sixers wanted him to be more aggressive in regard to looking for his own shot recently. Harden who’s overcoming left hamstring soreness kind of struggled in that role.

Harden was more of the distributor in a lot of the games in which the Sixers had success.

“It makes my job a lot easier when [Maxey] and Tobias are aggressive” Harden said. “We know what Joe’s going to go every night. But when Tyrese and Tobias are aggressive and they’re efficient and being aggressive and attacking the rim and knocking down shots you know I get the rest. I’ll take whatever the rest is.

“Like I said it’s possession by possession game by game. Some games I need to be a little more aggressive. But with all that said I think when all of us are playing well together and on the same page we got a very very good chance to win.”

Harden’s play

It’s no secret that Harden’s numbers were in decline over the last six games especially in fourth quarters. Doc Rivers addressed that before the game.

“I just think our pace is slower you know” he said. “We gotta get back to playing at the pace we were playing at the beginning. We’ve had a couple of sprinkle-in games where we do that. But there are things that we can do.

“But his numbers are not going to be like his numbers in Houston because he’s playing with a pretty good player [in MVP candidate Joel Embiid].. So those types of numbers I would never compare him to or anybody to.”

Rivers had mentioned having a similar situation when he coached the Boston Celtics to the 2008 NBA title. Back then future Hall of Famers Ray Allen Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett had their numbers take a bit of a hit while playing together.

“Everyone was getting on Ray and Kevin at the beginning of the year saying they’re not scoring the same” Rivers said. “I said ‘Well yeah they have to split the ball between three guys now.

“With James he’s probably getting used to that a little bit as well.”

But for Harden it’s not just about sacrificing his game . The perennial All-NBA selection has been struggling to produce in the clutch. He made just 4 of 18 shots in the fourth quarters of his previous six games.

He scored two points on 1-for-2 shooting against the Hornets in the first quarter Saturday. However he went on miss three of four shots in the second quarter and had just 5 points at intermission.

Harden started to find his groove in the third quarter with seven points on 2-for-4 shooting including a three and a pair of free throws. But he was at his best as a facilitator dishing out six assists and was a plus-21 in the quarter.

Miles Bridges paced the Hornets (40-38) with 20 points and five rebounds. They’ve lost two of their last three games after winning seven of eight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvd2VsbHN1bi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8wMy9zaG91bGQtY29sbGVnZXMtcGF5LWF0aGxldGVzLXllcy_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb3dlbGxzdW4uY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMDMvc2hvdWxkLWNvbGxlZ2VzLXBheS1hdGhsZXRlcy15ZXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should colleges pay athletes? Yes,"St. Peter’s University’s run of upsets wasn’t the only storyline from this year’s March Madness tournament. The other is that the Memphis Tigers men’s basketball team is in trouble for allegedly paying its players in violation of NCAA rules. It is time for the NCAA to do the right thing and allow players to be paid for three main reasons.

The first is fairness. College players are unpaid laborers who generate millions of dollars for others.

The second is that big-time college sports are in fact a business. There is nothing amateur about the NCAA’s $1.15 billion in revenue its marketing deals college coaches’ and athletic directors’ salaries or the amount of time many athletes put in to compete at a high level.

The third reason is practical: Black markets exist. Some star college players will always be paid no matter what the NCAA says. It should be above the table so schools and the NCAA can keep a better eye on it.

The party has already started even if the NCAA is arriving late. As of last year some college athletes may now make money from their name image and likeness (NIL) which were previously the NCAA’s property. The new interim NIL policy means that some players can now make money from endorsements sell T-shirts and other branded merchandise and make paid public appearances.

The NIL rule also applies to teams. Georgia Tech for example made a deal to promote TiVo on its sports teams’ social media accounts. Some players received a prepaid debit card for $404 to match Atlanta’s 404 area code plus some merchandise.

The NIL policy specifics vary from state to state and federal legislation may be on the way. And schools are still for the most part not allowed to directly pay student-athletes for their work. And the new NIL policy mainly benefits the more recognizable athletes.

This new system has room for improvement and the next few years will uncover its flaws. But it is a step in a fairer direction. It should be refined not scrapped. College sports are big business amateur or not. College athletes receive almost none of the revenue they generate beyond scholarships. By contrast the major professional leagues pay players between 50 and 60% of revenue.

That is no problem for the few college athletes who go on to NBA or NFL careers but for most athletes whose sporting careers end when college does it is unfair. Just like athletes who go pro they deserve to have their playing days boost their future earning power.

Other athletes would also benefit. Most college sports from baseball to field hockey lose money. Those sports are subsidized by profitable men’s basketball and football programs. If schools and the NCAA see more dollar signs from the big-revenue sports they will chase after them same as any other business. That would mean more money for other sports as well as academic programs. It might even mean some compensation for players who deserve to be paid for their labor. It could also encourage money-losing sports to find ways to be self-supporting which would bring stability to many threatened programs.

Paying athletes would also finally acknowledge an open secret: Some college athletes will always get paid no matter the rules. Boosters have long paid star athletes under the table. Off-the-books compensation is a routine part of the recruiting process though not all of it is paid in money. Once a recruit is on campus athletic directors sometimes arrange no-show jobs. College athletes aren’t allowed to have agents but that happens anyway. Colleges might as well acknowledge the inevitable and bring these activities above ground to help prevent abuses.

College sports can be thrilling to watch whether it is this year’s Cinderella busting everyone’s bracket seeing new stars shine for the first time or cheering for your alma mater. But off the playing field things are a lot less thrilling for the players.

The NCAA is a cartel and acts like one. The new NIL rules are the start of something fairer and more honest. But it isn’t enough. Players should be paid for the value they create same as everyone else.

by Gaurav Gupta Spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic rapid digitization increasing internet and smartphone penetration and government initiatives like National Digital Health Mission and Make in India the healthcare sector is digitizing and innovating at an accelerated speed. As the pace of digital innovation accelerates the opportunities for healthcare companies and manufacturers will multiply and patient outcomes will improve.The digitization of India’s healthcare will inevitably optimize the practice of doctors enhance patient-doctor communication and improve patient outcomes. Besides the two obvious stakeholders technological changes in the Indian healthcare system can also benefit other members of the ecosystem. The Indian government is planning to set up a National Health Stack where all major stakeholders such as hospitals insurers TPAs government and HealthTech startups can come under one roof. These diverse stakeholders can facilitate the collection of comprehensive healthcare data electronically.An electronic national health registry would allow policymakers to form robust policies detect fraud in health insurance measure outcomes and boost medical research in India. The portability of this data will cut costs save time enable monitoring improve patient outcomes and even prevent the outbreak of viruses and diseases. It will also help pharmaceutical companies laboratories and medical devices manufacturers to leverage the information system to address the country’s long-standing healthcare challenges and build innovative drugs devices and solutions. Additionally the government has allocated ₹1600 crore for five years towards the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission ( ABDM ) to propel India’s digital healthcare.Digital healthcare has introduced telemedicine and virtual care models which have proved to be life-saving at the peak of the mortal pandemic. According to reports 80 per cent of doctors in North India adopted telemedicine 50 per cent in Southern and Western regions and 35 per cent in East India during the pandemic. Consequently patients in rural and remote areas of the country who remained aloof to healthcare services are now able to access affordable and quality healthcare. Thanks to technology patients can now seek online consultation and get medicines delivered to their homes within a few minutes. Additionally the emergence of medical wearables has made patients more aware of their health and can help in the prevention of lifestyle diseases. Artificial Intelligence and robotics can also improve accuracy enable precise diagnosis and remote treatment.Despite the myriad benefits of digital healthcare challenges abound in the Indian healthcare system. The absence of clear regulations and guidelines may lead to fraudulent practices data theft and misuse of digital prescriptions and electronic health records. The lack of digital infrastructure and skilled professionals is another roadblock to the digitization of the healthcare system. According to reports the density of skilled active health workforce in India is as low as 11 to 12 doctors and nurses/midwives per 10000 persons. Digital upskilling and robust infrastructure can prove to be expensive and formidable endeavors. India must overcome data privacy and cybersecurity issues to unlock its full potential in digital healthcare.The benefits offered by digital healthcare surpass the challenges by leaps and bounds. Government initiatives and incentives along with changing patient expectations have made India a fertile ground for HealthTech startups. Currently 7128 HealthTech startups populate India’s digital healthcare ecosystem. These healthcare startups are aiming at specific problems and building innovative technology solutions that can help leapfrog the gaps in the Indian healthcare system. The pandemic has further fuelled global investments into healthcare startups and firms in India. An integrated network of hospitals labs insurers pharmaceuticals and HealthTech startups under the regulatory framework of government policies and guidelines can help India chart a successful roadmap for the future.Moving forward the Indian healthcare system is projected to witness a massive spike in demand as well as supply of digital healthcare services. An ecosystem of AI robotics telemedicine electronic health records IoT and digital therapeutics among others will strengthen the country’s healthcare backbone to overcome challenges in patient monitoring healthcare accessibility affordability supply chain claims settlement and quality of care. From being a laggard in technology adoption to being a leading innovator the healthcare sector has come a long way and is forecasted to propel even further. The horizon of India’s digital healthcare is brimming with high hopes and possibilities.Gaurav Gupta Co-Founder of Navia Life Care- a health tech startup(DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETHealthworld does not necessarily subscribe to it.

Like so many others in the central Oklahoma theater community Donald Jordan has a Brenda Williams story.

And like so many of those stories parts of it are hard to print in a newspaper.

""She played the only woman in 'Laughter on the 23rd Floor' ... which is a very autobiographical play about a writers room in the 1950s. It's based on Selma Diamond and Imogene Coca the Sid Caesar show and all its writers"" said Jordan founding artistic director emeritus of Oklahoma City Repertory Theatre where he co-starred with Williams in the 2004 production of the Neil Simon comedy.

""She had this one long monologue where she goes 'I don't want to be considered a woman writer I want to be considered a good writer. You know if I was in France I'd learned to speak French. But I'm here so I learned to speak (expletive). I go home every night and I smell like a humidor and I swear like a sailor.' ... It's funny speech and she did it so well because Brenda whom I loved indeed swore like a sailor. So it was a natural fit.""

A prolific and versatile theater actor and director Williams died March 21 after a brief battle with pancreatic cancer. She was 63.

""Our OKC theater family has lost a huge talent. Brenda was as comfortable with drama as comedy both onstage and behind the scenes as a director"" said Rhonda Clark Carpenter Square Theatre's longtime executive artistic director in an email.

""As a friend I mourn her passing but I also mourn for the audiences who will not get to experience her spirit.""

Theater standout was an OKC native

Williams was born April 25 1958 in Oklahoma City to Edna and Odis Williams. A 1976 Moore High School graduate she earned her bachelor of fine arts from the University of Oklahoma in 1980 before taking on an acting apprenticeship at the Alley Theatre of Houston Texas.

Clark said she first met Williams in drama school at OU in 1976.

""She was in demand as an actress there and very much in demand today in Oklahoma City. Brenda was truly a spitfire on and offstage and brought humanity and hilarity to the stage"" Clark said in an email.

For Carpenter Square Williams performed in ""The Rocky Horror Show"" in 1986 ""Enchanted April"" in 2006 ""Sordid Lives"" in 2007 and 2010 and ""Fugue"" the community theater's last show at the now-demolished Stage Center in 2010. She directed the community theater's productions of ""Voices in the Dark"" in 2004 ""Tiger Lady"" in 2006 and ""The Chosen"" in 2009 and planned to helm a show on the Carpenter Square's upcoming season in its new venue.

Actor performed with numerous central Oklahoma theaters

Williams performed and directed with many of the theater companies in central Oklahoma. She was a founding member of Guthrie's Pollard Theatre where she played the lead in the 2018-2019 season opener David Javerbaum's comedy ""An Act of God.""

""I spent 16 years there and then have gone back for several shows"" Williams told The Oklahoman in 2018. ""Every time it's like putting on a comfy pair of jeans and lolling around because it's just so comfortable. I know every inch of the place and even as it changes I still feel like it's as much of a part of me as it was in 1987 when I started there.”

More: It'll be hard to miss the spotlighted soloist in Native composer's new concerto

At OKC's Lyric Theatre she played the title character's tough yet nurturing grandmother in ""Billy Elliot"" the quick-witted matchmaker in ""Fiddler on the Roof"" the take-no-prisoners dodgeball coach in ""Hairspray"" and most recently the zany Mother Superior in the 2021 outdoor production of the madcap musical comedy ""Nunsense.""

Williams portrayed a legendary country singer's fan-turned-friend in ""Always ... Patsy Cline"" at Lyric and later directed and co-starred in the fact-based musical play at The Boom.

She also frequently took on multiple roles including the spirited Mrs. Fezziwig in Lyric's annual presentation of ""A Christmas Carol.""

""Our entire Oklahoma theater community has lost one of its most cherished and beloved members. ... Brenda always brought love kindness honesty and artistry to everyone on stage backstage and to hundreds of thousands of patrons"" said Michael Baron Lyric's producing artistic director in an email. ""I will miss her dearly — especially around Christmastime.""

At Oklahoma Shakespeare in the Park Williams played the nurse in ""Romeo and Juliet"" and Ma Joad in ""The Grapes of Wrath."" Kathryn McGill the classics company's artistic and executive director called her ""Oklahoma City theater royalty.""

""She was luminescent onstage. She had the ability to create a beautiful stillness in dramatic roles and embrace comedy with so much humanity. She elevated and made humane every scene every character she played"" McGill said in an email. ""It was a privilege to have worked with this brilliant woman.""

Birthday celebration planned for actor

Williams also was a familiar face on the local improv scene and was part of the revolving cast of Everybody and Their Dog OKC's longest running improv troupe.

The Oklahoma City native taught acting stagecraft and English at Classen School of Advanced Studies Harding Fine Arts Academy Midwest City Public Schools the University of Central Oklahoma and OU.

Family and friends have established the Brenda Williams Memorial Fund through the Oklahoma City Community Foundation. The fund will support performing arts education for learners of all ages in the OKC area.

Elin Bhaird recently retired artistic director of Oklahoma Children's Theatre said Williams requested no funeral or memorial service. So a birthday party is planned in her honor April 25 at Lyric's Plaza Theatre.

Williams was preceded in death by her parents and a brother Joseph Williams. She is survived by her brother Charles Williams of Korea; her sister Sandi Chaney of Oklahoma City; her aunt Karen Dorrell of Moore; and numerous nieces nephews and cousins.

Although he only worked with her twice Jordan said Williams was simply unforgettable.

""Just speaking about the craft she was remarkably versatile. ... She did everything: She did drama she did comedy she did musicals. You could just hand it to her and she could do it"" Jordan said.

""She had a gentle kind spirit ... and she was a mentor to so many.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldHJvaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA0LzAyL2RldHJvaXQtY29ya3Rvd24tZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQvNzIwNjYyMDAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Detroit's Corktown buzzes with development: 'It's busy busy busy',"Your subscription supports:

The company’s representatives will be working the market to develop new licensing partnerships for its HGTV Home Collection brand potentially across the full spectrum of home furnishings.

“We’re looking for product categories that are organic a natural fit and make sense for the brand” Carolann Dunn Discovery’s vice president of consumer products and licensing told Furniture Today.

The network previously had a licensing partnership with Bassett Furniture which expired in 2019 opening the door to new furniture partnerships as well as additional categories across home furnishings.

In outlining the types of partners the network is looking for Dunn cited its existing agreement with Sherwin Williams for premium quality paints currently distributed exclusively through Lowe’s home improvement centers. “That program has been around for 10 years has constantly grown year-over-year and encompasses significant retail real estate and an online shop” Dunn said. “That’s the model we’re looking for.”

She noted that HGTV conducts extensive research on its audience and its brand and in extending the HGTV Home Collection brand into new areas it will look for partners that align with that vision.

“If a company is looking to execute a growth strategy not looking to create a house of brands come to us” Dunn said. “We are where the consumer is looking for inspiration for the whole home. We build business with partners that endure.”

While the company has more detailed closely held criteria on its licensing partnerships Dunn noted that in general there is a preference for companies with well-established manufacturing and sourcing capabilities a record of proven success and strong product design development and sourcing capabilities.

“We also place a premium on impeccable ethics and compliance standards” she noted. “We need to have visibility through the supply chain to make sure the products and working conditions meet ethical standards.”

In terms of where the HGTV brand plays in the marketplace Dunn described HGTV consumers as upscale well-educated women typically aged 25 to 54 who own their own homes. “She has disposable income she’s inspired by the network and with that inspiration she has true purchase intent” Dunn said.

While the brand has applicability across a broad range of home categories Dunn noted that the goal at the outset is to work with companies that have broad manufacturing and sourcing capabilities rather than parsing out the license to myriad category specialists.

“We are very selective. We say no more than we say yes” Dunn explained. “It’s not about a flash in the pan it’s about building businesses that endure. It’s quality vs. quantity.”"

From building the pirate ship at Treasure Island nearly 20 years ago to constructing and renovating high-end homes in Las Vegas today Scott Acton and his Forte Specialty Contractors are now riding the wave of the luxury real estate market.

In a luxury segment with limited inventory putting an aging million-dollar-plus home on the market doesn’t guarantee there’s a buyer even with such high demand. Buyers today want the latest technology high-end finishes and more open floor plans.

Some homeowners such as Forte CEO and founder Acton are jumping aboard this trend spotting opportunities to tap into the robust luxury market that craves modern designs.

Acton purchased a 2003 home in Red Rock Country Club for $1.025 million in September 2020. He spent a year updating the home and has placed it on the market for $3.5 million. Forte Speciality Contractors is constructing some of the most expensive new homes in Las Vegas including several at the Summit Club in Summerlin.

The two-story home that’s listed by his daughter Samantha Paez a Realtor with Signature Real Estate Group measures 4546 square feet after 100 square feet was added. It has five bedrooms six baths and an office that can double as a gym.

“We acquired the home because it was the right place at the right time” Acton said. “It sits on the golf course in Red Rock. The way homes were designed (20 years ago) are not what people are looking for today. We completely gutted this home and changed its structure. We added steel windows and doors to the home. We modernized everything. It’s a flush base and (high-end upgrades) throughout with contemporary marble and stone. It’s a special place.”

The remodeled home has Diana Royal marble flooring past the gold lacquered metal slat wall that separates the dining and living room spaces. There’s a double island marble-countered kitchen that features white European millwork finishes Viking appliances and custom banquette seating Paez said.

The den powder room and a en suite bedroom is on the first level with the remaining four en suite bedrooms upstairs. The primary bedroom features a patio custom fabric headboard attached to the wall with the bath featuring floor-to-ceiling Vanilla Onyx marble Paez said.

The backyard has new etched concrete landscaping and a new pool and a spa with views of the golf course.

Las Vegas-based Forte also operates in California and Arizona. The company is building 15 homes for clients in The Summit adjacent to Red Rock Country Club. Acton said they do luxury remodels like the latest one only for homes they acquire and resell.

“We usually build in the $10 million to $20 million range and we thought this level of sophistication and fit and finish would bode well in older country clubs” Acton said. “I think people aren’t prepared for the level it takes to create a home like this. It was a yearlong process — the redesign and structural engineering. It takes a special skill to deliver at this level. We do a lot of this in Southern California by taking a lot of the beach properties and adding value.”

Acton said homes they built in the Summit for example cost $2000 to $2200 a square foot. They remodel homes for $700 to $800 a square foot.

“We see a real sweet spot there” Acton said. “Normally we build ground-up for clients. We find properties in the right ZIP code and right gated community or if it’s on a golf course or has a view of a lake or ocean. Those are our targets and we can bring that level of sophistication and execution to these different developments that will command a higher price. Our business is moving away from customers and into our own development.”

Acton said his daughter who has worked for him for three years scouts for these properties.

Paez said many homes in Red Rock Country Club and other neighborhoods at a similar price point to what they had are sitting on the market because they were built in 2001 to 2005 and haven’t been updated.

“With this property we re-invisioned the floor plan because the architects of 20 years ago people don’t live like that anymore” Acton said. “It’s a family home but it’s open and lives under one room. A mother (or dad) of four to five kids can stand in the kitchen and can see the pool.”

Renovating homes in excess of 4000 square feet requires a major overhaul. Several walls were removed and new electrical and plumbing systems were installed.

“When we first saw the home we ended up adding a full bedroom and bathroom” Paez said. “That’s where some of the square footage came in as well as in the living room. It had beautiful bones and was ready for a complete renovation. It was extremely outdated. It had older darker cabinets that were no longer in but now we have European white cabinets.”

The master bathroom was extended into the bedroom because it was so large Paez said. People live more in their bathroom than they do in their bedroom and they added a makeup counter to it.

“I think it definitely caters to being a family home” Paez said. “We have a double island large pantry and banquette seating. It’s great for entertaining and large groups of people. It’s warm and friendly with warm marble floors as well as the kitchen counters and bathrooms. The bathroom stone is beautiful.”

Acton said homes they build and remodel have “a feeling to them.” His firm is what he called “experiential builders” that started in the theme-park business and ultimately went into hospitality and experiential dining and retail.

“The fixtures and acoustics in the home and softness and livability is just different from what you see” Acton said. “Just because a home is bigger doesn’t make it customer-special. It has to be thoughtful and we put a lot of thought love and care into our developments. If you look at the before-and-after for this it’s just mind-boggling to see what it was versus what it is today.”

Acton said he trained under casino mogul Steve Wynn. His firm worked for Wynn in Macau and in Las Vegas for his properties. Forte has built out Hell’s Kitchen at Caesars Palace and Carbone at Aria Las Vegas. The company did Margaritaville for Universal Studios and has worked on Disney projects.

“We’ve had amazing luck and been exposed to a lot of different projects” Acton said. “Taking that experiential side of the world and bringing it into the way people live is really special. And through these last few years of the COVID pandemic people value time more than they do a lot of things. That’s why delivering something that’s done is important. Not everyone sees the difference but there are a select few people (who) can walk in and notice these finishes and aren’t shy about being willing to pay for them. That’s what we want to provide to people.”

Acton said he was pushed into the luxury home market by working for Wynn Resorts its largest commercial customer.

Former Wynn Chief Operating Officer Marc Schorr requested Acton build him a 13000-square-foot home in the Summit in less than 14 months. It was one of the first homes built in the uber-luxury resort development.

“Typically in this industry it takes a lot longer to do this” Acton said. “We approach the build very differently like a commercial builder because that’s how we were trained. That allows us to expedite. We self-perform some of the trades. We have 180 employees and are well-equipped with whatever comes our way.”

Some of the most spectacular homes they’ve built they can’t talk about because there’s non-disclosure agreements Acton said. Outside of Las Vegas they’ve built estates in Newport Beach and Dana Point in California and West Palm Beach in Florida.

“We’ve worked with some of the most amazing architects and designers in the world and we’re very fortunate” Acton said.

Some of the homes Acton said he’s built in the Summit are worth between $20 million and as high as $50 to $60 million. They’ve built four homes so far five are in some stage of construction and another six to eight will start in the next year he said.

“A lot of them haven’t traded hands yet” Acton said. “A few that have are trading north of $2300 to $2400 a square foot which puts a 20000-square-foot home at what number?”

That would mean the homes would be on the market for about $50 million

Acton said there’s a considerable number of homes still to build in the Summit and he anticipates for what they’ve been contracted for that they’ll finish in mid-2024. Homes range in size from 10000 square feet to 25000 square feet.

Acton said he continues to be surprised by the luxury market in Las Vegas. If the trend line stays as it is in California the market will continue to grow in Las Vegas he said.

“The homes we’re building in the Summit are legacy homes” Acton said. “I feel like people are building their dream home. They’re either retiring or having some kind of liquidity event. With the security they provide out there and the golfing and the restaurant (everything) is world-class service. The Summit has definitely changed luxury in Las Vegas. It has changed the view of Las Vegas. For the people coming here now (they are) a different breed very sophisticated and creative people.”

Minutes before they were set to attend Sunday’s Grammy Awards in Las Vegas the group announced that Dave Bayley — the group’s frontman — had tested positive for Covid and will be missing the awards show.

“I am so overwhelmingly heartbroken” Bayley wrote on Instagram. “Not just within myself but for everyone who has worked so insanely hard with us over the past couple of chaotic years and for every one of you who supported and believed in this project enough to get us here through thick and thin.”

Bayley wrote that he’s “showing no symptoms so far” but decided to not attend the show. And since the group was around him over the past few days the rest of the band — Drew MacFarlane Joe Seaward and Edmund Irwin-Singer — will ship the show due to the potential exposure.

“I wanted to do it for Joe who survived that horrible accident and was strong enough to recover” he wrote. (Seaward was hit by a truck while riding a bike in 2018.) Bayley later added “‘Heat Waves’ is a song about missing someone and loss in difficult times. That difficult time has bitten us tonight and we will miss sharing the evening with you all. The meaning of the song is hitting me hard right now.”

The group is nominated for Best New Artist against the likes of Arooj Aftab Jimmie Allen Baby Keem Finneas Japanese Breakfast the Kid Laroi Arlo Parks Olivia Rodrigo and Saweetie.

“I am in my room. I have ordered room service. And I am prepped with several bags of Cheetos and gummy bear multivitamins” Bayley concluded. “I am ready to kick the small pointy arse of Covid and cheer for all the amazing musicians and records being honored tonight.”

Glass Animals notably attended several pre-Grammy events including the MusiCares Person of the Year event celebrating Joni Mitchell."

Texas Beef Council prepares for new season of BBQuest TV series

AUSTIN -- Texas Beef Council (TBC) has announced the third season of its popular BBQuest television series began production in late March with a targeted premiere date in summer 2022.

In Season 3 BBQuest host Kelsey Pribilski will be joined by co-host Jess Pryles live fire cook author of Hardcore Carnivore and Season 1 alum. Together the two will delve even deeper into the world of Texas barbecue discovering stories of dedicated pitmasters and ranchers who make the state’s favorite staple so special while enjoying some delicious meals along the way.

“Rather than organizing this season’s episodes around a particular geographical location we’re focusing more on the storytelling component” said Rachel Chou TBC’s director of consumer marketing. “Each BBQuest episode will center around a different uniting theme allowing the co-hosts to discover what really makes Texas barbecue so unique. Kelsey and Jess will still visit some of our state’s best barbecue joints but they’ll also stop in at nearby cattle ranches to highlight the beef producers who make it all possible.”

To date BBQuest has been viewed by fans more than 2.9 million times. Learn more about BBQuest and watch Seasons 1 and 2 at BeefLovingTexans.com.

Event Info

Rock & Roll Hall of Fame band Bon Jovi has announced the Bon Jovi 2022 Tour produced by Live Nation and sponsored by Hampton Water. The tour is scheduled for arenas this coming Spring.

The band spent much of the past two years recording and releasing new music while also creating livestream performance content and launching Bon Jovi radio for their fans. Bon Jovi’s 2020 was one of the most critically acclaimed album releases of that year with USA Today calling it ""BRILLIANT"" and Associated Press highlighting the depth of lyrics within the songs that ""chronicle pain loss fear and death from the coronavirus police killings and mass shootings.""

Bon Jovi remains one of the most prolific and sought-after tour tickets in live music today and getting back on tour was a top priority for the band. ""We have all missed touring and we know that nothing can replace the energy of a live show for the fans or the band"" said Jon Bon Jovi.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJvY2twaXQubmV0LzIwMjIvYm9uLWpvdmktbGl2ZS1hdC10aGUteGNlbC1lbmVyZ3ktY2VudGVyLXN0LXBhdWwtbW4tNC0zLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LIVE REVIEW: Bon Jovi - Xcel Energy Center St. Paul MN April 3rd 2022,"Bon Jovi rolled into town last night but only their second stop up there spring 2022 North American tour to what appeared to be a sold-out crowd. In a way you could say this is in support of their latest record released in 2020. Simply titled Bon Jovi 2020. And I must tell you there were a lot of really excited fans there last night. There were more signs in the audience than I have seen in a long time. It felt like an old school concert in a way.

I’ve been seeing Bon Jovi play live literally since they first came out on the scene back in 1983. The song that captured my attention off their first album was “She Don’t Know Me”. They followed that up with a solid record titled 7800 degrees Fahrenheit. But when Slippery When Wet was released that blew the doors off everything and launch them into MTV superstardom. The first indication to me that They were going to be big was when they opened for .38 Special at the Met center in Bloomington MN. After Bon Jovi’s set literally 3/4 of the audience left the building and didn’t even stay for the headlining act. At that time .38 Special had a lot of hits on the radio. I felt bad for them that night I’m guessing that’s when they realized their career was over.

I followed Bon Jovi’s career through the years and I’ve seen them many times. I’ve always liked the music although a lot of the hair band fans and the harder edge metal fans seem to kind of poke fun at them for being too soft and poppy. To me that was their brilliance. They were poppy but with a guitar driven edge. They have always had a very loyal following of fans. And that was on display last night in St. Paul. It’s not an accident nor is it easy to build a base of fans like Bon Jovi has over the years. I must give props to Jon Bon Jovi for not forgetting where he came from. Last night he had a very popular local DJ John Lassman in the front row. John currently works for Saint Cloud’s Rockin’ 101. My understanding is John was the very first DJ in America to play “Runaway” which helped to launch Bon Jovi’s career. All these years later he still takes care of the people who helped him. I don’t know about you but I think that’s amazing. if I remember correctly he even thanked him at the rock and roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony.

I went with some hesitancy because the last time he was in town for his This Home is Not for Sale tour quite honestly I was bored. Some will argue that the magic is gone because Richie Sambora is no longer with the band. I guess there is an argument to be made on both sides of that fence. I for one have absolutely no skin in the game I just like the music. In 2020 they released a record titled Bon Jovi 2020. Jon even referred to that fact last night and that they didn’t have an opportunity to properly promote it because of the pandemic. You could tell by the way Jon spoke of the album that he was very proud of the songs. He made it a point to play five of them last night. My buddy Kyle that I went with mentioned he had heard an interview that Jon said “I’m going to play these songs for me not for the fans”. I have to say I really respect that.

I’ve never been disappointed by hearing new music by artists. if you think about it they made music at one point that you absolutely loved and you’re a huge fan. So why wouldn’t you want that artist to continue to make new music? How many times do we have to listen to some of those hits until we can say enough is enough? I have to say of all the new songs I thought “Beautiful Drug” could be one of the best songs he has ever written. Of course he gave the fans what they wanted and played a bunch of his hits from the 80’s like “Wanted Dead or Alive” “You Give Love a Bad Name” and “Livin’ on a Prayer”. One of the songs it was glaringly obvious that was missing from the set was his very first hit ”Runaway”. Which was completely OK by me. If I live the rest of my life and never hear that song again I won’t shed any tears. Not because it isn’t a great song I’ve just heard it enough. I’m probably the weirdo in the audience who prefers to hear the new music.

I think the presentation with this tour over the last one was considerably better. Although I was very disappointed that there was no pyro. The video screens that they employed and the graphics were fantastic. They had a camera in the front row on a track that would go back and forth during the entire show to give the people in the back a great view on the large video screens. The one downside to this idea is that the stage is so high that I think the people in the front row had the worst seats in the house.

My advice to you is go see this tour because musically they are amazing as they always have been. I think the new music is solid and you owe it to yourself to give their last record spin. But if you’re going to go to the show the best advice I can give you is choose a seat that’s at least 10 rows back on the floor or on the lower level on either side. It’s a considerably better view than being right up close. I enjoyed it and I will continue support him whenever he comes to town. Bon Jovi is another one of those legacy acts that’s only going to be touring for just so much longer. If you are a fan of their heyday in the 80’s and you love all those songs this tour is totally worth the price of admission.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS92aWRlby9jb25jZXJ0LXJldmlldy1qb24tYm9uLWpvdmktMDQyODAwNDM4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Concert review: Jon Bon Jovi's pained vocals were livin' on a prayer at Xcel Energy Center concert,"At first glance Bon Jovi’s concert Sunday night at St. Paul’s Xcel Energy Center looked a lot like the ’80s survivors’ other local shows in the time since guitarist Richie Sambora’s acrimonious departure from the band in the middle of a 2013 tour.

Sambora’s replacement Phil X brought heft to both the anthems and the ballads and showed true musical chemistry with touring guitarist John Shanks (the band’s producer since 2005). Lead singer Jon Bon Jovi who turned 60 a month ago exploded with impressive youthful energy. Musically speaking the rest of the band — including the rhythm section of drummer Tico Torres and bassist Hugh McDonald — sounded tight on the second stop on their first tour since 2019.

The set list included a generous selection of songs from the group’s 15th album “2020” (“Limitless” “Beautiful Drug” “Let it Rain”) the smashes from their heyday (“Livin’ on a Prayer” “Wanted Dead or Alive” “You Give Love a Bad Name”) and more recent songs that have become concert staples (“This House Is Not for Sale” “Who Says You Can’t Go Home” “Have a Nice Day”).

So far so good right? Sunday’s show delivered pretty much everything you’d want from a Bon Jovi concert with one major exception — some shockingly poor vocals from Jon Bon Jovi. He’s never been a particularly technical singer and his voice has lost some power over the past decade. But Bon Jovi didn’t just miss a note here or there he struggled throughout the two-plus hour show. Nothing from his past suggested such a sudden decline was coming.

He wasn’t just butchering the older stuff which the band now plays in a lower key but the fresh material as well. And weirdly enough at times it sounded like he was trying (and failing) to emulate Axl Rose in his prime. Quite frankly it felt like he had forgotten how to sing.

Given the pandemic and the band’s time away from the road it’s tempting to give them the benefit of the doubt. And JBJ himself caught COVID last fall knocking out his voice for two weeks. Then again in recent interviews Bon Jovi has said the band spent three weeks in rehearsals far longer than their typical warm-up time.

Story continues

Not to put too fine of a point on it but one can’t help but wonder why no one in the Bon Jovi organization sat the guy down for an honest chat. I guess it’s because he’s the boss and no one wants to cross him? He’s always been the face of the group and in the time since Sambora left he’s taken full control. He’s the only band member who writes songs (many with Shanks and other producers) and the cover of “2020” is a solo shot of Bon Jovi looking somber in shades.

Whatever the case JBJ did warm up slightly for a run of acoustic songs midway through the show. He wrote one of the new songs “American Reckoning” after the murder of George Floyd and dedicated it to Floyd’s daughter Gianna. He also introduced the band’s 2000 single “It’s My Life” with a story about a viral clip showing residents of Odesa in Ukraine making sandbags while a drummer played along to the song.

“The magic of music sometimes baffles” Bon Jovi said. Yes and that wasn’t the only baffling thing about the night.

Fanti the Bulldogs junior goaltender signed with the Oilers on Monday a little over 24 hours after his captain signed with the Philadelphia Flyers. Cates’ two-year entry-level deal begins this season while Fanti’s two-year contract doesn’t kick in until 2022-23 meaning he still had some time to enjoy the NHL as a fan before he became an employee.

“I was so happy to see him and you can see his face light up when he saw us” Fanti said. “To have pretty much every single guy on the team find a way to make it work and to get down there was super special.”

While Cates was drafted by the Flyers back in 2017 Fanti signed with the Oilers organization as a 22-year-old undrafted free agent following a single season as the undisputed No. 1 goaltender of the Bulldogs.

Fanti said it didn’t really cross his mind Tuesday he had taken a big step toward living out the same dream that Cates was living out that night at Xcel Energy Center. Fanti said he was just excited to see a former teammate play in the NHL in person. That was a first for him.

“It still doesn’t feel real” Fanti said of signing with the Oilers. “Nothing has hit me. I’ve just been hanging out with the guys figuring out some school stuff. Life hasn’t really changed yet.”

Fanti the former Minnesota Wilderness goaltender sat his entire freshman season split time with Zach Stejskal a year ago and then took over the starting role this year by posting a .929 save percentage and 1.83 goals against average with seven shutouts in 37 starts en route to being named the NCHC Goaltender of the Year.

Fanti capped his Bulldogs career with a .961 save percentage and 1.14 GAA in the NCHC and NCAA tournaments including three shutouts. UMD won the NCHC Frozen Faceoff title and came within a win of another NCAA Frozen Four.

“As much as I've grown as a hockey player I’ve grown as a young man here” Fanti said. “We’ve experienced so many life lessons and learn that kind of stuff through teammates and through best friends and through roommates through the coaching staff all the team faculty all that kind of stuff. Those experiences that you have on a day-to-day basis and then you have those really cool ones when you get into playoffs and down the stretch just different things like that. It's been an absolute dream. UMD to come to play there was my No. 1 dream growing up as a kid playing college hockey.”

As of Thursday Fanti is one of six college goaltenders to have signed an NHL deal this spring after the season ended and one of four from the NCHC along with Omaha’s Isaiah Saville (Vegas) St. Cloud State’s David Hrenak (Los Angeles) and Western Michigan’s Brandon Bussi (Boston).

A native of Thunder Bay Ontario Fanti said he was unaware of how many NHL teams showed interest in him as he was leaving all professional inquires during the season to his advisor. Had UMD been in the Frozen Four this week he’d still be in the dark wanting to focus solely on bringing the program another NCAA title.

Fanti said based on the research he and his team did Edmonton was clearly the best fit as they looked at franchises’ goaltending depth  development system and the reputation of the American Hockey League franchise.

Once he gets his academics in order — Fanti isn't withdrawing from school he’s finishing out this semester at UMD — he plans to join the Oilers’ AHL affiliate the Bakersfield Condors for a short stint on an amateur tryout agreement to familiarize himself with the franchise.

“Nothing was even close in terms of just overall attractiveness and in the situation and how it fit in my shoes perfectly” Fanti said of the Oilers. “Edmonton is an unbelievable franchise with everything they have down from management to their actual team. Obviously they're a great team and you want to go somewhere because you want to win right? You want to go and have that opportunity — if ever do get to play there — you want that opportunity to be on a good team too and to chase a Stanley Cup which is crazy to say out loud.”"

The five-mile “March to End Modern Slavery in the Fields"" kicked off Saturday at about 1:15 p.m. as farmworkers with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers called on the fast-food restaurant chain to join the Fair Food Program.

The program targets assault verbal and physical abuse wage theft and the mistreatment of farm workers nationwide.

""It's about justice"" Tomás Terraza a 43-year-old farmworker who lives near Homestead said in Spanish. ""We're fighting for our basic rights in the fields in construction in roofing and in many different job fields.""

Terraza said all workers need access to legal resources if their rights are violated at work. Hot weather inadequate access to clean drinking water and few rest periods make farm work dangerous he said.

The march targeted Wendy's Board Chairman Nelson Peltz who lives in Palm Beach. Organizers said they hope to put pressure on Wendy's top decision-maker to start conversations on their concerns about working conditions.

As the United States gets warmer outdoor workers and farmworkers are at increased risk for heat-related injuries and death.

Though heat-related injuries are hard to track and likely undercounted excessive heat seriously injured nearly 70000 U.S. workers and killed 783 people between 1992 and 2016 per federal data gathered by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen PBS News Hour reported last August.

""They must listen to us"" Terraza said of Wendy's and other food companies. ""They have to recognize and uphold human rights.""

Wendy's denies ability to partake in Fair Food program

Lack of care and resources for workers tasked with harvesting the nation's food leads to exploitation organizer Gerardo Rayes-Chávez said.

""Since I was a kid I've been working in the fields"" Rayes-Chávez said of his 14 seasons picking oranges tomatoes and watermelon. ""Now I'm organizing people in the fields ... the dignity of workers is at stake here.""

The Fair Food Program is an antidote to exploitation according to Reyes-Chávez.

McDonald’s Burger King Subway Yum! Brands and Chipotle as well as major grocers and food service companies such as Whole Foods Walmart Aramark and Compass have joined the Fair Food Program the coalition said.

Saturday's march garnered support from farmworkers around Florida and as far away as Minnesota and Vermont. Attendees wore T-shirts that identified them with worker's groups that read ""We Count!"" and ""Justice for Farmworkers"" and ""Worker Power. Tenant Power. People Power.""

Poetry music call-and-response and a theatre-like performance called on marchers to demand change from U.S.-based fast food and chain restaurants.

In the case of Wendy's a spokeswoman told the Palm Beach Daily News and Palm Beach Post on Thursday that the company sources food such as tomatoes ""exclusively from indoor hydroponic greenhouse farms"" while the Fair Food Program operates in outdoor tomato growing and harvesting environments.

""The idea that joining the Fair Food Program and purchasing field-grown commodity tomatoes is the only way that Wendy’s can demonstrate responsibility in our supply chain is not true"" spokeswoman Heidi Schauer wrote in a statement to the newspapers.

Faith communities travel to support farm workers

The organization said Kerry Kennedy an attorney who is the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy and Archbishop of Miami Thomas Wenski participated in the march.

Other members of the South Florida faith community supported the mission Saturday.

Kim Roblez the 40-year-old pastor of Miami Shores Presbyterian Church brought a group of congregants to the march to show solidarity with farmworkers.

""We're coming because we believe that Jesus was one that always stood with the oppressed and marginalized and it's our call to do the same"" she said. ""I would like to see the entire industry change so we don't have any more abuses in the fields.""

Speakers and poets at Saturday's rally shared testimonials from farmworkers that included people being injured on the job not having access to clean water to drink while working and being sexually harassed and at times assaulted while working on farms.

Rayes-Chávez who lives in Immokalee said the Fair Food Program allows workers the right to complain about working conditions without fear of retaliation the right to be parts of health and safety committees and frequent assessments of working conditions.

""We need to work free of abuses that include modern-day slavery. That is a serial killer as well as sexual assault and child labor. We need zero tolerance"" he said.

The 2016 march generated controversy because of geographic limits Palm Beach had set on the march. In the end about 500 people protested through town streets on March 12 2016 and the town later paid more than $160000 in attorneys' fees and costs after a federal lawsuit filed by the march organizers.
