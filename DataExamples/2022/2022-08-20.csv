Italian divers Lorenzo Marsaglia and Giovanni Tocci delighted the home fans with respective gold and bronze medals in the men‚Äôs 3m springboard final on the penultimate day of competition at Roma 2022.

Lois Toulson and Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix secured Britain a fifth gold in Italy with victory in the synchronised 10m platform final with Ukraine and Germany completing the podium.

MEN‚ÄôS 3M SPRINGBOARD FINAL:

Tokyo Olympic bronze medallist and four-time European champion Jack Laugher was the favourite for another title heading into the men‚Äôs individual 3m springboard final but his form has been patchy this season.

The Briton was the second highest scorer in the preliminaries with Italian 1m bronze medallist Giovanni Tocci topping the standings but with the scores reset they were just two among of host of potential medallists.

As expected Laugher made a strong start and led after two rounds but big errors in the third fifth and sixth rounds saw him out of contention for a podium place.

Jordan Houlden ‚Äì Simone Castrovillari / LEN

Team-mate Jordan Houlden who won two medals at the Commonwealth Games earlier this month demonstrated much greater consistency and his combined score of 428.55 would be enough for silver ‚Äì his first individual European Championship medal.

As the competition progressed the Italian fans became increasingly excited as Lorenzo Marsaglia and Giovanni solidified their medal prospects.

The pair had each won 1m medals earlier in the week ‚Äì behind Laugher ‚Äì but success on the 3m is what they craved most and it was Marsaglia who would secure his place at the top of the podium.

His best dive came in the third round with 84.00 helping him to a total of 453.85 while Tocci claiming third despite errors in the third and final rounds.

WOMEN‚ÄôS SYNCHRONISED 10M PLATFORM FINAL:

Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix has enjoyed an incredible month winning two golds and a silver at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham UK before heading to Roma 2022 and securing her first individual European crown.

The 17-year-old also took silver in the Team Event but with her usual synchronised 10m platform partner Eden Cheng missing the event to undergo ankle surgery she was paired with British team-mate ‚Äì and individual rival ‚Äì Lois Toulson.

Despite only 24 hours of training together the pair made a confident start and were in joint second with Ukraine after two of the five rounds.

German sisters Elena Wassen and Christina Wassen were top of the standings.

The pair had each won European honours at previous events but never together and although they could not quite maintain their gold medal push their strong performance and total score of 289.86 was enough to claim bronze.

Ukrainian duo Kseniia Bailo and Sofiia Lyskun were in third heading into the final round but an impressive last dive saw them climb to second ‚Äì total 298.86 ‚Äì and secure silver.

British selectors will have some interesting decisions to make next season when deciding synchronised pairings after Spendolini-Sirieix and Toulson claimed gold with a combined score of 303.60.

‚ÄúWe only had one training session but I have grown and learned so much since Tokyo especially in terms of how to deal with pressure and have fun competing‚Äù Spendolini-Sirieix told LEN TV. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exhausted but happy and had a lot of fun diving with Lois.‚Äù

Laugher 27 who won the 1m springboard title and Harding 22 ended more than 25 points clear of Italy in Rome.

Williams won his first major individual medal behind Ukraine's Oleksii Sereda.

Cutmore 19 took bronze in his first major individual final.

Sunday's success in the final two diving events ensured Britain topped the medal table with six golds from the 13 diving finals - and 12 medals in all.

It is the British diving team's best-ever performance at the European Aquatics Championships surpassing the three golds and 11 medals they won in 2016.

Britain - who also won 15 swimming medals including four golds - were second in the overall medal table.

Abdullah was attacked by the two would-be thieves while driving near Park Lane.

After smashing the window of his black Bugatti Chiron hypercar it appears that they were unsuccessful in stealing from the millionaire.

The target was believed to be his Platinum Rolex Daytona watch which is worth over ¬£110K.

Mr Al Basman was staying at the Berkeley Hotel where witnesses said the muggers followed him from before carrying out the assault.

A witness said: ‚ÄúThe moped thieves were at the hotel this morning and staff told them to get off the pavement.

‚ÄúWhen Abdullah left in the Bugatti they started following him all the way to Hyde Park Corner. One beeped their horn which I assume was the signal to start attacking.

‚ÄúI assume they were waiting for a junction they knew would have a long red light so they had time to attack them.‚Äù

It is thought the bandits may have targeted the Kuwaiti playboy who flaunts his supercars and expensive watches on social media.

Footage of the crime shows the thieves brazenly attacking Abdullah's supercar in the middle of the day while shocked motorists watch on.

Despite hammering the window of his luxury motor the Kuwaiti millionaire is seen speeding away while the thieves are forced to ride off down a side street.

Other videos surfacing on social media appear to show the same moped riders attacking another pedestrian in Mayfair later in the day.

Met Police confirmed they had been called to Curzon Street in Mayfair just before 5pm on Sunday August 21.

They said: ""A man aged in his 40s reported being assaulted by two men who stole his watch. Officers attended along with the London Ambulance Service and the man was treated for injuries at the scene. He did not require hospital treatment.""

No arrests have been made.

The two lions which are the biggest ever made in the country by the Malaysia Hakka Culture Association (MHCA) Sarawak were recorded as the ‚ÄòBiggest Hakka Lion Costume‚Äô.

This is the second record that MHCA Sarawak has created following ‚ÄòMost Hakka Lions Dance‚Äô comprising 71 lions performing at CityOne Mall here in January 2020.

Witnessing the historic event last night at the Kuching South City Council (MBKS) Square were Deputy Minister of Public Health and Housing Michael Tiang who represented Deputy Minister of Tourism Creative Industry and Performing Arts Dato Sebastian Ting as well as Kuching South mayor Dato Wee Hong Seng.

According to Ting whose text-of-speech was read by Tiang more cultural events like this should be organised ‚Äî not just to promote Chinese Hakka culture but also to attract tourists to Sarawak.

‚ÄúWe hope this kind of event can attract more people from outside Sarawak to visit Kuching and Sarawak. The Malaysia Hakka Culture Association is also doing their promotion through their social media platform.

‚ÄúHakka people in Thailand and Singkawang Indonesia have responded in social media asking where this event is and where is Kuching. This shows an event such as this can help promote our Sarawak tourism. We hope to have more of these events throughout Sarawak‚Äù he said.

Ting also approved a grant of RM20000 to MHCA for the construction of the Hakka Lions as well as for organising the event.

Meanwhile Wee congratulated MHCA for their second Malaysia Book of Records record and hoped other clans and races could emulate them in displaying the rich culture of the Chinese.

‚ÄúIt is everyone‚Äôs responsibility to continue with our cultural heritage and finding the real roots of our culture because through culture and understanding we will be able to understand each other much better.

‚ÄúEveryone is talking about different cultures and religions but to let other people know our culture we need to put up more awareness more performances and cultural activities such as this ‚Äî then people will start to understand‚Äù he said adding this was one of the reasons how Sarawak unites.

‚ÄúIt can be through dance food practices and so on. I hope we will continue with the cultural exchanges and awareness events to be frequently presented to other races so they can understand us better‚Äù Wee said.

According to MHCA Sarawak the Hakka lion is different from the usual lions seen during Chinese New Year or other parades.

Also dubbed the ‚ÄòGreen Lion King‚Äô the Hakka consider it as the ‚Äòking‚Äô among lions and it has unique features such as eyes which look down the ‚Äòba gua‚Äô diagram and the Chinese character for ‚Äòking‚Äô must be engraved on the forehead representing the ‚Äòking of beasts‚Äô.

The lower forehead is covered with red cloth and the bottom is cyan. The mouth shape of the lion is usually a wide square design.

The pattern of the Hakka lion‚Äôs head is inseparable from Taoism‚Äôs ‚ÄòEight Immortals‚Äô and features eight lucky instruments for adornment such as the gourd fan bamboo flute flower basket lotus flower jade plate sword and fish drum.

Historically the Hakka lion dance came to Sarawak from the south of Guangdong.

In recent decades the traditional Hakka lion dance has been passed down through generations and one can see them perform during Chinese New Year or temple celebrations.

Traditionally in Hakka communities they are called ‚ÄòHopo Hakka Lion‚Äô and are honoured as the ‚ÄòLion King‚Äô.

Also present at the event were MHCA Sarawak president Michael Liong and organising chairman Vincent Voon."

Greg Abbott R-Texas often knocks President Joe Biden for high inflation and a looming recession ‚Äî a standard GOP argument going into the November elections.

But inflation is even worse in major Texas cities than across the nation as a whole. Government figures show inflation is 10.2% in the Houston area and 9.4% around Dallas higher than the latest national average of 8.5%.

Abbott and other GOP leaders are making a paradoxical argument that the U.S. economy has slumped into a recession but Republican-led parts of the country are still booming. Those officials are blaming Biden‚Äôs policies for sky-high gasoline and food prices while taking credit for the job gains those same policies helped spur.

The Texas governor tweeted on July 28: ‚ÄúThe U.S. economy is in a recession under Biden. Meanwhile Texas was #1 in the nation for job growth in June & more Texans have jobs today than ever before in our state‚Äôs history.‚Äù

The Associated Press found a familiar pattern in 15 Republican-led states in which governors on Twitter would praise job growth in their states while senators would simultaneously say the national economy as a whole was crashing. These seemingly conflicting claims were also repeated in public remarks.

GOP leaders say state policies such as low tax rates and keeping business open during the pandemic helped to fuel hiring and investment. But their claims tend to ignore how job growth was also boosted by a historic injection of federal money that began in March 2020 and continued under Biden with last year‚Äôs $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.

Biden and his fellow Democrats have acknowledged the pain caused by inflation that hit a 40-year high this summer. But the president has stressed that the United States has avoided a recession because of the low 3.5% unemployment rate. He argues that global factors such as the pandemic fragile supply chains and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine caused prices to jump ‚Äî and that he‚Äôs meeting the public‚Äôs needs with the economic and climate package signed into law on Tuesday.

‚ÄúToo often we hand the biggest microphone to the critics and the cynics who delight in declaring failure while those committed to making real progress do the hard work of governing‚Äù Biden said in a swipe at the GOP.

Multiple surveys do show that voters have a sense of foreboding about the economy and that most people fault the president. Researchers said there‚Äôs not a lot of academic analyses to show why many voters seem willing to blame inflation on White House policies and give a pass to statehouses as inflation had been low in recent decades and less of a factor in elections than jobs.

Andrew Reeves a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis said most voters likely judge the local and national economies by different standards. When it comes to state and local officials voters form opinions through what they observe in their daily lives. But they often gauge the national economy through hard numbers and political ideologies.

‚ÄúThe ‚Äònational economy‚Äô is this nebulous thing that none of us actually experiences‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an abstract concept. We may be more willing to let our partisanship shade how we see what is going on nationally. Joe Biden is well into his term so the honeymoon is over and he owns this economy ‚Äî whether his policies are directly responsible for it or not.‚Äù

Republican governors such as Florida‚Äôs Ron DeSantis and Georgia‚Äôs Brian Kemp are largely unscathed on inflation even though consumer prices are significantly above the national average in both of those states. Inflation is 10.6% in the Miami area 11.2% in Tampa and 11.5% in Atlanta.

What many voters in Republican states are hearing is an economic argument similar to what Biden has attempted on a national scale ‚Äî that job growth and government finances are strong enough to insulate people from a downturn.

DeSantis dismissed Biden‚Äôs claims that the U.S. economy remains healthy calling that ‚ÄúOrwellian doublespeak.‚Äù The governor said at Florida‚Äôs Airports Council conference on Aug. 1 that his state‚Äôs budget surplus could insulate it from a downturn.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not immune to the inflation we‚Äôre not immune to the energy prices‚Äù DeSantis said. ‚ÄúBecause Florida has been open because Florida has excelled economically we‚Äôre in the position where we‚Äôre going to be able to meet those needs of the state regardless of what Uncle Joe throws at us from Washington D.C.‚Äù

Job growth has been broad across the country. Data released Friday by the Bureau of Statistic s found that employment increased in 43 states and was essentially unchanged in seven states over the past 12 months.

But the bipartisan research group EIG analyzed job growth in the three major Republican states (Texas Arizona and Florida) and the three major Democratic ones (California Illinois and New York). It found that the GOP areas have fully recovered and exceeded their pandemic job totals while the recovery has been slower in Democratic states.

What seems to be the much more overarching priority among voters is not jobs but inflation said John Lettieri EIG‚Äôs president and CEO. At a time of political polarization it‚Äôs striking to him how fears about prices are crossing generational class regional and partisan lines.

‚ÄúThere is strong unanimity that the economy is an issue inflation is the No. 1 problem and Biden is to blame‚Äù Lettieri said. ‚ÄúThis cuts across all the divides. All those different ways we slice up the electorate they‚Äôre all responding to this to one degree or another in strong ways.‚Äù

Inflation appears to be an inescapable challenge for Biden even as other issues such as abortion rights appear to be rallying Democratic voters. Republicans are able promote job gains to say why they would be better at leading the economy without having to list as Biden has stressed in speeches their own policies for reducing consumer prices.

Gabriel Lenz a political science professor at the University of California Los Angeles said the ‚Äúbest measure of what voters are personally experiencing‚Äù is a metric known as real disposable personal income. That figure looks at how much money people have after adjusting for taxes and inflation. Its changes over the past two years mirror those of Democratic political fortunes.

When Biden signed pandemic relief into law in March 2021 people‚Äôs real disposable income climbed 28.7% from a year ago. The aid helped the economy recover while some notable economists warned it could also be inflationary. As prices rose over the past year and much of the aid expired real disposable income has tumbled 3.5% over the past 12 months as a result.

Based on that number Lenz concluded: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no surprise that people are gloomy.‚Äù

The North Florida district is in the market for a lawmaker to succeed Eucheeanna Republican Rep. Brad Drake who is term-limited this year. Drake has served in the House for 12 of the last 14 years and now he has a chance to help his preferred successor to the House.

In recent months the establishment has rallied around Shane Abbott a DeFuniak Springs pharmacist. Abbott is endorsed by five of the Panhandle‚Äôs state Representatives including Drake. He also has the vote of Florida Professional Firefighters the Fraternal Order of Police the Florida Medical Association and more.

Despite Abbott‚Äôs profile his competitors shouldn‚Äôt be written off.

Vance Coley of Marianna is the son of former Reps. David Coley and Marti Coley. David Coley served nearly five months in House District 7 before he died in 2005. Marti Coley finished out his term and served HD 7 then HD 5 until 2014 when Drake ran to succeed her.

Coley is endorsed by the Florida Police Benevolent Association a powerful lobby in ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù Florida that denies Abbott a monopoly on the endorsement front.

The third candidate running is Jackson County Commissioner Clint Pate who operated a local business and farm supply store for 15 years. The DeFuniak Springs resident is also Chairman of the Jackson County Republican Executive Committee and an Assistant Secretary of the Republican Party of Florida (RPOF). RPOF Chair of Chairs Evan Power is the Treasurer for Pate‚Äôs campaign.

It‚Äôs not just the establishment that‚Äôs lining up behind Abbott. He has raised half a million dollars between his campaign account and his political committee Prescription for Florida‚Äôs Prosperity.

Still Coley and Pate have also posted significant figures. Coley has raised more than $100000 between his campaign account and his political committee adVance Northwest Florida Values. Pate has raised around half that.

With the latest redistricting cycle HD 5 now covers Holmes Jackson Walton and Washington counties as well as part of Calhoun County. Because the only three candidates running in the race are Republicans all HD 5 voters can cast their vote in Tuesday‚Äôs Republican Primary.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FhZmNhLXR2LWhvbm9ycy1hYmJvdHQtZWxlbWVudGFyeS0yMzUwMjE0MDIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AAFCA TV Honors: 'Abbott Elementary' 'Pachinko' & 'Insecure' Make List Of Winners,"The African American Film Critics Association (AAFCA) held the 4th Annual AAFCA Awards today to celebrate and recognize outstanding work in the television industry.

Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine has Europe bracing for a tough winter but the costs are piling up higher in emerging nations as governments struggle to keep energy flowing to citizens hit by surging inflation.

Pakistan‚Äôs government is triggering rolling blackouts and boosting power bills because it can no longer secure enough fuel. Shops in Bangladesh are closing at 20:00 as part of energy austerity measures while Mexico‚Äôs government has bolstered subsidies to cushion residential electricity costs.



The crunch comes at a particularly difficult time: The global shift to cleaner energy sources meant developed economies weren‚Äôt investing in efforts to boost fossil fuel production while poorer nations were being pressed to adopt cleaner-burning natural gas. Now with gas prices more than 150% higher since the Russian invasion in February and wealthier nations able to pay more to ensure adequate supplies emerging nations can‚Äôt compete.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt look like there is any way they can outbid the developed countries‚Äù said Muqsit Ashraf who leads Accenture‚Äôs Global Energy Industry practice in Houston. ‚ÄúIt is having significant economic implications; it will also have an impact on their ability to fund other economic and national priorities.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a problem playing out across the developing world.

Already gas deliveries that were scheduled for Pakistan or India are being redirected to Europe where buyers are able to afford higher prices according to energy traders. Sri Lanka is struggling to secure fuel from its regular suppliers while Argentina didn‚Äôt buy liquified natural gas cargoes for August after prices surged.

The energy import bills for developed nations are between 2% and 4% of gross domestic product according to Ashraf. For comparison those costs for some emerging nations have climbed above 25% of GDP he said. Meanwhile plummeting currencies are keeping import costs prohibitively high exacerbating efforts to control inflation.

Governments across Latin America have responded by ramping up subsidies and cutting taxes on gasoline and diesel to appease angry citizens still struggling to rebound from the pandemic. Mexico will spend about $25 billion on fuel and electricity subsidies this year. In Panama the government was forced to act after angry protesters took to the streets.



In Africa the World Bank took the unusual step of subsidizing bus passengers in Mozambique to mitigate the crisis while in Burundi gasoline shortages are compelling drivers to buy fuel on the black market at three times the official price. Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo is now seeking to double International Monetary Fund support to $3 billion after protests over issues including rising fuel prices.

For much of the last decade coal and gas were cheap and abundant ‚Äî and fast-expanding emerging economies benefited. A flurry of new LNG export facilities came online from Australia to the US while consumption in Japan and South Korea ‚Äî the commodity‚Äôs top importers ‚Äî plateaued. Moves by rich governments to abandon dirty coal resulted in a supply glut and the shale revolution flooded international markets with crude oil.

Those days are over.

Indian natural gas distributor Gail has been unable to secure enough LNG for its domestic customers forcing it to cut supply to major users such as petrochemical plants and fertilizer makers. In Thailand retail electricity tariffs were hiked by 17% this week because of pricey LNG imports.

With LNG rates rallying about 1 300% in the last two years Pakistan and Bangladesh haven‚Äôt been able to secure a single spot shipment for months. BSRM Bangladesh‚Äôs largest steelmaker by market value cut production by at least 20% due to the nation‚Äôs power crisis according to Aameir Alihussain a managing director at the company.

‚ÄúNobody is insulated from this crisis‚Äù he said.

Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury the adviser on power energy and mineral resources to Bangladesh‚Äôs prime minister called for patience saying earlier this month that ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt promise anything unless we find a huge reserve of gas.‚Äù

But citizens in many nations have run out of patience.

Pakistani protesters have blocked roads across the country. In one incident demonstrators threw stones at the police which had to resort to using water cannons to disperse the crowd. In Panama highways and ports were blocked.

'Ripple effect'

‚ÄúThe longer the energy crisis goes on the more likely there is to be civil unrest around the world‚Äù said Susan Sakmar a visiting assistant professor at the University of Houston Law Center.

It‚Äôs not just the developing world that is suffering. Germany may not have enough gas to get through winter if Moscow cuts off supplies. The UK is buying Australian LNG for the first time in at least six years amid tight supplies. And a surge in US gasoline prices earlier this summer may do lasting damage to President Joe Biden‚Äôs Democratic party in November midterm elections.

But those nations have options poorer ones don‚Äôt. Developing nations have long complained that rich countries aren‚Äôt channeling enough money to help with the energy transition and ambitious climate change targets. Now that gap is widening and they are getting left behind.

‚ÄúWhen energy is so central to everyday life it can have a ripple effect that goes well beyond the energy equation‚Äù said Accenture‚Äôs Ashraf. ‚ÄúIt may prompt another rethink in the developing world about taking steps in the energy transition more slowly until energy systems are stabilised.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,

From an AES news release:

The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today provided an update on the Waikoloa Solar + Storage project that is scheduled to begin full operations producing power for homes and businesses on Hawai‚Äòi Island in April 2023.

Located along Waikoloa Road on a 300-acre parcel about 7.5 miles from the Queen Ka‚Äòahumanu Highway the Waikoloa project will generate 42.2 MWdc of renewable energy supported by a 120 MWh containerized lithium-ion battery energy storage system. When fully operating the facility will produce enough electricity to power 13600 Hawai‚Äòi Island homes at a cost to consumers of 9 cents per kWh through a 25-year power purchase agreement with Hawaiian Electric.

AES Clean Energy President Leo Moreno led a site tour and informational briefing for key lawmakers policymakers and stakeholders about the project‚Äôs status which is approximately 60% complete while emphasizing the need to have more renewable energy sources.

‚ÄúWe must replace fossil fuels in Hawai‚Äôi and the planet and this transformation needs to begin happening now‚Äù said Moreno. ‚ÄúOur Waikoloa project is an example of how together with our stakeholders we are co-creating solutions for a more sustainable energy future for Hawai‚Äòi Island and its people.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,

How about loading up on former head coaches?

Saban has hired Lane Kiffin Mike Stoops Major Applewhite Butch Jones Steve Sarkisian Mike Locksley and Charlie Strong just to name a few since taking over the Crimson Tide. The majority of them were hired as an analyst. Saban has won seven national titles while Sanders is looking for his first Black college football national title.

Sanders has now hired former Minnesota Vikings coach Mike Zimmer to be an analyst for Jackson State. The two worked together when Sanders was a defensive back for the Dallas Cowboys and Zimmer was the defensive backs coach. Together the pair helped the Cowboys win Super Bowl XXX against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The 66-year-old Zimmer a defensive specialist with 43 years of experience coached Sanders from 1995-99.

Sanders introduced Zimmer to the team Tuesday in Jackson State‚Äôs newly re-furnished football film room.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs asked me about it a few times. The pay‚Äôs not good‚Äù Zimmer said with a grin on Thee Pregame Show. ‚ÄúBut I do love Deion and I‚Äôd do anything for him.‚Äù

Zimmer was the coach of the Vikings for eight seasons going 72-56-1 overall before being fired in 2021 after two losing seasons in a row. Prior to joining the Vikings Zimmer remained on the Cowboys' staff from 1994-2004 surviving five coaching changes. He was with the Atlanta Falcons before taking the role of defensive coordinator with the Cincinnati Bengals from 2008-13.

‚ÄúHe can open up so many doors for these young men but I‚Äôm extremely impressed with the way he‚Äôs teaching"" Zimmer said.

Earlier this summer Sanders hired former Minnesota Golden Gophers coach Tim Brewster to his staff. He was coach from 2007-10 where he helped the Golden Gophers to the Insight Bowl in both 2008 and 2009.

Brewster will be a special assistant to Sanders. He was a tight ends coach at Florida (2020-21) where he tutored The John Mackey Award winner Kyle Pitts. Pitts was selected as the fourth overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. Brewster coached wide receivers at Mississippi State in 2012 and also tight ends with the Denver Broncos.

In two seasons at Jackson State Sanders has a 15-5 record and last season was one of the best in the school‚Äôs history. the Tigers were 11-2 and won the Southwestern Athletic Conference championship. Sanders was named the SWAC Coach of the Year last season.

Li 2 CO 3 was electro-oxidized and the gas evolution was quantified. Because both CO and N 2 have the same mass-to-charge ratio of 28 (m/z = 28) the mass spectrometer typically used in a DEMS system lacks sufficient mass resolution to distinguish the contribution from CO (m/z = 28.0104) and N 2 (m/z = 28.0140). Although GC could separate the CO and N 2  it cannot distinguish and quantify the 13CO 2 /13CO 2 and 12CO/13CO. Therefore an in situ DEMS-GC coupling system (Supplementary Fig. 1) was used to quantify the evolution of 12CO 12CO 2  13CO and 13CO 2 . The details of the experiments are described in Methods. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2 after calibration the CO evolution signals from DEMS and GC experiments are consistent which provides a reliable amount of CO in the following experiments.

Super P carbon (Timcal) was ball milled with Li 2 CO 3 with a mass ratio of 1:1. A Li 2 CO 3 -Super P (1:1) composite electrode was prepared to construct a cell with 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane-sulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI)‚Äîtetraglyme electrolyte as stated in Methods and the cells were charged by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). As shown in Fig. 1a the anodic current for oxidation reaction and gas evolution started at 3.9 V (vs. Li+/Li all potentials in the text below are versus Li+/Li) which is consistent with the thermodynamic decomposition potential of Li 2 CO 3 (3.82 V according to Eq. 1). A control experiment without Li 2 CO 3 was carried out (Supplementary Fig. 3). The onset potential of electrolyte decomposition is at 4.3 V. The background current of carbon/electrolyte oxidation at 3.8 V is 10-fold smaller than Li 2 CO 3 decomposition (Fig. 1a) and there is no CO 2 or O 2 evolution. In Fig. 1a a large amount of CO 2 and CO were identified as the gas products which confirms the decomposition of Li 2 CO 3  consistent with the literature1617. According to the mass loading of the electrode (see Methods) ~60% of the preloaded Li 2 CO 3 decomposed eventually. The ratio e-/CO 2 for Fig. 1a is 2.1 close to 2e‚Äì per CO 2 (Supplementary Table 1) suggesting it is an electrochemical process. The deviation is from the electrolyte electro-oxidation without producing CO 2 (Supplementary Fig. 3) which is consistent with the literature41. The molar flux of both CO 2 (denoted as ·πÖ CO2 ) and CO (denoted as ·πÖ CO ) follow the trend of the current during charging (equivalent to ·πÖ electron ) but they could derive from different processes because of the multisource of the CO 2 and CO evolution. Therefore we mainly focus on the ratio CO 2 /CO because it helps us to determine the mechanisms (Eqs. 1‚Äì3). The ratio CO 2 /CO exhibits the comparison between Li 2 CO 3 decomposition and other reactions because Li 2 CO 3 decomposition does not form CO as discussed later. The ratio CO 2 /CO in Fig. 1a is 7.06 (Supplementary Table 2) which does not fit any reaction pathways proposed above. Due to the lack of O 2 evolution Eq. (1a) could be excluded. The oxygen appears as singlet O 2 (1O 2 ) instead of low-energy triplet O 2 (3O 2 ) which will be discussed in detail later.

To further study the influence of electrode composition on the gas products the same experiment was conducted using a Li 2 CO 3 -Super P (4:1) composite electrode. As shown in Fig. 1b similar gas species without O 2 were identified. Because the Li 2 CO 3 -Super P (4:1) composite electrode contains more insulating Li 2 CO 3 solid than that in Li 2 CO 3 -Super P (1:1) electrode leading to poor solid-solid contact the charging current and consequent gas evolution in Li 2 CO 3 -Super P (4:1) is one order of magnitude lower than those in Li 2 CO 3 -Super P (1:1) electrode. If the CO 2 and CO came from a certain intermediate or a simple one-step reaction the same ratio CO 2 /CO would be observed. However the ratio CO 2 /CO varies with the electrode composition from 7.06 to 9.82 (Supplementary Table 2). This result suggests that the Li 2 CO 3 decomposition is a complicated multistep process instead of a simple one-step reaction as proposed previously1617. Because Li 2 CO 3  the carbon substrate and the electrolyte all might contribute to CO 2 and CO evolution it brings up the confusion about the source of CO 2 and CO which is the key to addressing the reaction mechanisms.

Gas products of Li 2 13CO 3 decomposition

The isotope-labeled Li 2 13CO 3 was used to identify the decomposition mechanisms of Li 2 CO 3 . The Raman spectrum and XRD pattern of the Li 2 13CO 3 confirm its composition (Supplementary Fig. 4). The 12C-impurity in Li 2 13CO 3 is determined by using a mass spectrometer (MS). The details are described in Methods‚ÄîIsotope impurities. The Li 2 13CO 3 contains 15% isotope impurity of Li 2 12CO 3 (Supplementary Fig. 5) which would be subtracted from the MS results in the following experiments.

Figure 1c exhibits the gas evolution during the charging process of the cell with a Li 2 13CO 3 -Super P composite electrode. Li 2 13CO 3 was electro-oxidized and a large amount of 13CO 2 is identified which is definitely from the Li 2 13CO 3 decomposition because both Super P carbon and electrolyte are unlabeled. No O 2 evolution is identified again. 13CO was not observed as well indicating that the Li 2 13CO 3 decomposed to merely 13CO 2 without 13CO. The decomposition of Li 2 13CO 3 (releasing 13CO 2 ) contributes 79% of the overall CO 2 and CO evolution and it is the dominant process during charging. Meanwhile some CO 2 and CO from the inevitable decomposition of electrolyte and carbon substrate were identified during charging. The electrolyte/carbon decomposition contributes to approximately one-fifth of total gas evolution (Supplementary Table 3) which is a high ratio of side reactions.

In the Li-CO 2 chemistry with lithium carbonate isotopically labeled with 13C on an unlabeled carbon substrate (which we write here as 12C for simplicity) Li 2 13CO 3 is posited to decompose together with the carbon substrate in the following reaction:

$$2{{{{{{\rm{Li}}}}}}}_{2}{\\!}^{13}{{{{{\rm{C}}}}}}{{{{{{\rm{O}}}}}}}_{3}+{\\!}^{12}{{{{{\rm{C}}}}}}-4{{{{{{\rm{e}}}}}}}^{-}\to 4{{{{{{\rm{Li}}}}}}}^{+}+{2}{\\!}^{13}{{{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}+{\\!}^{12}{{{{{\rm{C}}}}}}{{{{{{\rm{O}}}}}}}_{2}$$ (4)

If it was the case the ratio between 13CO 2 and 12CO 2 is expected to be about 2/1 but we find a ratio of 6.1/1 (Supplementary Table 4) much higher than 2/1 because 12C does not transform to sufficient 12CO 2 . This result suggests that the decomposition of the Li 2 CO 3 -C electrode is a complicated reaction instead of a simple reaction with known stoichiometric numbers like Eq. (4). Therefore the contribution of the C substrate during the charging process is the key to demystifying the reaction mechanisms.

Decomposition of 13C-carbon substrate

To determine the contribution of carbon in this reaction the same experiments were carried out again but by replacing the Super P carbon substrate with 13C-carbon and leaving the lithium carbonate and electrolyte unlabeled. The 13C-carbon contains 1.5% of 12C impurity as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 7 both 13CO 2 and 13CO evolved during the charging process and the rest of CO 2 and CO evolution came from the decomposition of Li 2 CO 3 and electrolyte. As the only source of 13C-isotope 13C is oxidized to release both 13CO 2 and 13CO during the charging process. The formation of 13CO exhibits that the 13C is oxidized incompletely like an incomplete combustion reaction. The 13C substrate could be oxidized either electrochemically by potential or chemically by oxidative agents that are formed in the previous steps. If 13C is oxidized electrochemically the ratio 13CO 2 /13CO would depend on the potential (Fig. 2). If 13C is oxidized chemically by oxidative agents like 1O 2 and superoxide species which are generated during the charging process the electrode composition affects the ratio between 13CO 2 and 13CO.

The gas evolution during the charging process of the cells using Li 2 CO 3 -13C (1:1) composite electrode in 1 M LiTFSI-tetraglyme. Sweep rate: 0.05 mV s‚àí1. The cell rested for 4 h after reaching 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 and 4.7 V respectively. Ar flow rate: 0.5 mL min‚àí1. The molar flux (top panel) of gas evolution was denoted as ·πÖ and the charging current is translated to ·πÖ electron and the cumulative mole (bottom panel) of the gas was denoted as n. Full size image

Impact of the potential on the decomposition of 13C-carbon substrate

Due to the high equilibrium potential of Li 2 CO 3 decomposition (3.82 V) the cell potential could affect the decomposition reactions and thus affect the formation of 13CO 2 and 13CO at different potentials during the charging process. Therefore a cell with Li 2 CO 3 - Super P composite electrode was charged with LSV from 4.3 to 4.7 V and the gas evolution was measured. The cell was rested for 4 h after reaching 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 and 4.7 V respectively to obtain a low background of gas evolution. The cumulative molar of gas evolution at various potential stages is shown in Fig. 2. The amount of CO 2 from Li 2 CO 3 decomposition increased when the potential increased. The higher the potential was the more CO 2 evolved in accord with the accelerating decomposition of Li 2 CO 3 . Meanwhile 13CO 2 and 13CO evolved simultaneously and their amount increased together with the CO 2 evolution when the potential increased. Supplementary Fig. 7 shows the gas evolution at various stages of the charging process from 4.4 to 4.7 V. The amount of 13CO 2 and 13CO evolution increased with the rising potential up to 4.7 V. This increase is probably because more singlet oxygen forms at a higher potential which leads to more severe carbon and electrolyte degradation. Although both 13CO 2 and 13CO increased the ratio 13CO 2 /13CO remains almost identical at these stages. This result suggests that the 13CO 2 and 13CO likely originated from the same chemical reaction.

To check whether 13C is oxidized to any solid byproducts the cell was dissembled at the end of charging and the composite electrode was collected to further quantify the remained solid by-product of inorganic/organic carbon as described in Methods‚ÄîQuantification of the solid byproducts. Neither Li 2 13CO 3 (Supplementary Fig. 8a) nor organic 13C-carbonates (Supplementary Fig. 8b) were detected in the charged electrode indicating that the 13C did not oxidize to any solid by-products i.e. inorganic and organic carbonates. Only unlabeled inorganic Li 2 CO 3 and organic carbonate were identified which are from undecomposed Li 2 CO 3 and electrolyte decomposition. The incomplete decomposition of Li 2 CO 3 may be due to the poor solid-solid contact between the carbon substrate and Li 2 CO 3 during the charging process. It is unlikely to decompose all Li 2 CO 3 even up to 4.7 V which is consistent with the literature41. Therefore as only 13CO and 13CO 2 and no 13C-containing solid products are detected when using 13C as the carbon substrate the carbon substrate is only oxidized to gaseous carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide during charge in the presence of lithium carbonate and the 1 M LiTFSI-tetraglyme electrolyte.

Previous results showed that the functional groups at the carbon surface dominated the decomposition of the carbon substrate47. Therefore the Raman and XPS spectra of 13C and Super P are recorded to show their surface condition (Supplementary Fig. 9). D-band and G-band of 13C were observed at 1289 and 1507 cm‚Äì1 respectively in the Raman spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Both D-band and G-band drift in the negative direction due to the isotope effect. The intensity of the D-band and G-band (I D /I G ) typically represents the disorderliness and amounts of defects in the carbon structure. Here 13C and Super P carbon show the same I D /I G of 1.20 which indicates the same degree of disorderliness and a similar amount of defects from the surface of 13C and Super P. Similar XPS spectra are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9b confirming the similar surface groups of these two carbon substrates. Therefore 3C and Super P have similar surface functional groups and they are likely to exhibit similar behavior in this carbon decomposition on charge.

Impact of the ratio of Li 2 CO 3 and carbon on the gas evolution

Although the 13C carbon substrate oxidized to 13CO and 13CO 2  its decomposition pathway is still ambiguous. It might be a pathway similar to the incomplete combustion reaction. Alternatively 13CO and 13CO 2 might be derived from a reaction intermediate with known structures like oxalate (C 2 O 4 2‚àí). To clarify the pathway we studied the gas products of four Li 2 CO 3 -13C composite electrodes with various mass ratios of Li 2 CO 3 /13C from 2:1 to 1:4 (Fig. 3). Overall the carbon decomposition contributes to about 10% of the total gas evolution and the exact contribution depends on the composition of the electrodes (Supplementary Table 3). When the composite electrode contains less Li 2 CO 3  ratio 13CO 2 /13CO decreases from 1.25 to 0.51 (Fig. 3h) indicating the extent of oxidation of 13C is restricted by the amount of Li 2 CO 3 in the composite electrodes. Otherwise the 13C would be completely oxidized to 13CO 2 instead of the mixture of 13CO 2 and 13CO. This varying ratio 13CO 2 /13CO confirms that the overall reaction is a multistep reaction rather than forming a complex intermediate like C 2 O 4 2‚àí which should give a certain ratio 13CO 2 /13CO independent of the ratio of Li 2 CO 3 /13C. The 13C is highly likely to be oxidized by the oxidative intermediates from Li 2 CO 3 decomposition. Therefore as ratio 13CO 2 /13CO varied with varying composition of the Li 2 CO 3 -13C composite electrode we argue that the amount of Li 2 CO 3 present in the electrode and thus the amount of oxidative intermediates from Li 2 CO 3 decomposition influences the decomposition route of the carbon substrate.

Oxidation of 13C-carbon by 1O 2 and superoxide

Both 1O 2 and superoxide are reactive intermediates formed during the discharge and charging process in Li-air batteries which could result in the decomposition of the carbon substrate4849505152. 1O 2 could attack the electrolytes and the electrodes as a strong oxidative species. Here 910-dimethylanthracene (DMA) a molecular trap for 1O 2  is used to identify the 1O 2 during electrochemical oxidation for the Li 2 CO 3 -C composite electrodes (see Methods‚ÄîIdentification of 1O 2 ). When 1O 2 forms it rapidly reacts with DMA to form DMAO 2  which could be identified in the 1H NMR spectrum. Here at the end of the charging process the electrolyte with DMA in the cell was extracted and its 1H NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 10) shows that DMAO 2 has formed which confirms the formation of 1O 2 during the charging process. Once 1O 2 forms 1O 2 attacks carbon and releases 13CO and 13CO 2 .

Here to study the contribution of 1O 2 and KO 2 to carbon decomposition 1O 2 and KO 2 were respectively used to react with 13C as ex situ chemical experiments. 1O 2 is produced from the disproportionation of superoxide species47 (The reaction between KO 2 and Li+ in this work). More details are described in Methods‚ÄîChemical experiments between reactive oxygen species and carbon. The gas evolutions of 13CO 2  13CO 12CO 2  and O 2 in the reaction between 1O 2 and 13C are shown in Fig. 3e‚Äìg and Supplementary Fig. 11. Figure 3e‚Äìg show both 13CO and 13CO 2 evolution which confirms the incomplete oxidation of 13C-carbon by 1O 2 . The formation efficiency of 1O 2 by disproportionation in solution is low therefore most O 2 is released as 3O 2 (Supplementary Fig. 11). Because 1O 2 is formed in the electrolyte solution rather than at the surface of 13C fresh 1O 2 is more likely to attack the electrolyte than the 13C forming a large amount of CO 2 . In addition because a large amount of carbon makes the suspension viscous the total amount of 13CO and 13CO 2 slightly decreased with the increase of 13C. When the amount of 13C increased more 13CO formed and the ratio 13CO 2 /13CO decreased (Fig. 3i and Supplementary Table 5). Both the in situ electrochemical charging experiments (Fig. 3h) and ex situ chemical experiments (Fig. 3i) show the same decreasing trend of ratio 13CO 2 /13CO with the increase of the amount of 13C relative to 1O 2 or Li 2 CO 3 .

On the other hand to further exclude the contribution from superoxide species the same chemical experiments were carried out but replaced 1O 2 with O 2 ‚Äì (sol) . KO 2 was dissolved in tetraglyme and crown ether was added to maximize the concentration of the O 2 ‚àí (sol) in the solution. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 12 only 13CO but no 13CO 2 was identified which suggests that O 2 ‚àí (sol) is incapable to oxidize 13C to 13CO 2 . In summary the detected 13CO and 13CO 2 come from the side-reaction of 1O 2 attacking the 13C substrate (Eq. 6). Herein we simulate the chemical reaction between 1O 2 and 13C without applying potential however the potential applied in the charging process could make the real side-reaction more complicated. More 1O 2 might be produced at a higher potential. It is noted that oxygenated byproducts from chemical reactions with 1O 2 could first be produced and then electro-oxidatively decomposed4849.

The CO and CO 2 evolution of electrolyte decomposition

The electrolyte decomposition during the oxidation of Li 2 CO 3 on charge is inevitable and should not be ignored. A cell with Li 2 13CO 3 -13C composite electrode was charged to quantify the contribution from electrolyte degradation (Fig. 4). Because the entire composite electrode is labeled with 13C isotope the 12CO 2 must come from the decomposition of the tetraglyme electrolyte. Figure 4 shows that 12CO 2 and 12CO from the electrolyte decomposition contribute ~12% to the total gas evolution (Supplementary Table 6). The ratio between carbon dioxide species (12CO 2 + 13CO 2 ) and carbon monoxide species (12CO + 13CO) is 7.76 which is in accord with the ratio CO 2 /CO of 7.06 in the Li 2 CO 3 - Super P (1:1) composite electrode as stated in Supplementary Table 2.

The unlabeled CO 2 and CO are contributed by electrolyte decomposition. Full size image

As discussed above the decomposition of Li 2 CO 3 and carbon substrate contributes to 79% and ~10% respectively of the total gas evolution. The side-reactions of carbon depend on the electrode composition because this charging process highly depends on the solid-solid contact between Li 2 CO 3 and carbon substrate. The exact ratios of decomposition of individual components were not completely identical in each experiment because the nature of Li 2 CO 3 decomposition is based on the solid-solid contact. At some contacting points the charging process will stop due to the large overpotential caused by the restricted solid-solid contact. The sum of gas evolution from Li 2 CO 3  carbon and electrolyte is ~100% which confirms the reliability of individual measurements.

Although an important consideration full understanding of electrolyte decomposition is not our focus in this work. Therefore to ensure that it does not affect the major gas evolution from Li 2 CO 3 and C we quantified the gas by-products and solid by-products from the electrolyte decomposition without further analyzing the liquid by-products dissolved in the solvent. The solid by-products like Li 2 CO 3 and organic carbon residuals in the composite electrode at the end of the charge were quantified respectively. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 13 approximately one-third of Li 2 13CO 3 is unreacted and remained in the electrode and a trace amount (<0.1 Œºmol) of organic carbonate were identified. This result indicates that there is no exchange of 12C/13C between the electrolyte and Li 2 CO 3 /C.

Electrochemical vs. chemical pathways of Li 2 CO 3 decomposition

Here our results show that Li 2 CO 3 decomposition in the ether-based electrolyte is mainly an electrochemical process which is in good agreement with Kaufman et al.33 but Freiberg et al claimed that Li 2 CO 3 decomposition was a chemical process in LiPF 6 carbonate-based electrolyte and it was induced by water41. They argued that the electrolyte was oxidized and decomposed on high potential and it formed some proton-derivatives which chemically react with Li 2 CO 3 to evolve CO 2 . To study the reasons of these contradicting results we conducted a series of comparative experiments. Firstly to avoid the direct participation of water in Li 2 CO 3 decomposition we carried out a chemical reaction between the commercial Li 2 CO 3 and 1 M LiTFSI tetraglyme electrolyte with 1000 ppm and 5000 ppm H 2 O respectively and the gas evolution was recorded. The result in Supplementary Fig. 14 indicates that no CO 2 and O 2 were detected even if there were lots of protons (from water) in the electrolyte. Then to check the impact of potential a cell with blank carbon (Super P or 13C) electrode without Li 2 CO 3 but with 1000 ppm of H 2 O in the electrolyte and the gas evolution was recorded Supplementary Fig. 15. No O 2 and CO 2 evolved during the charging process below 4.7 V. Interestingly in the presence of 1000 ppm H 2 O the onset potentials of electrolyte decomposition drifted to a lower potential of 3.8 V compared with 4.1 V without H 2 O. This result implies that H 2 O encourages the electro-oxidation of the electrolyte but there is still no gas evolution below 4.5 V.

Learning from Freiberg‚Äôs work we decomposed Li 2 CO 3 without direct electric contact to confirm the chemical mechanism41. Briefly an extra Celgrad membrane was placed between Li 2 CO 3 powder and the blank carbon composite electrode to separate them. On one hand the Li 2 CO 3 cannot be electro-oxidized due to the lack of direct electronic contact with the carbon electrode. On the other hand the porous Celgard membrane allows the electrolyte decomposition byproducts that form at the carbon composite electrode to diffuse across the Celgard and react with Li 2 CO 3 .

For comparison in the LiPF 6 -ethylene carbonate (EC)/ethyl methyl carbonate (DMC) electrolyte the same setup was used but the gas evolution was analyzed at the end of the charging process due to the volatility of the EMC. Because the Li 2 CO 3 is separated from the carbon electrode it cannot be electro-oxidized. However a large amount of CO 2 evolution was identified (Fig. 5a) above 4.3 V suggesting the chemical decomposition of Li 2 CO 3 by the electrolyte decomposition byproducts at high potential. This result is consistent with Freiberg‚Äôs work41. The ratio e‚àí/CO 2 is 2.20 in good agreement with the literature41 but it does not mean that Li 2 CO 3 is electro-oxidized via a 2-e process. Instead the electrolyte decomposition is likely to produce active H+ at a ratio e‚àí/H+ of 1 and the H+ reacts with Li 2 CO 3 to release CO 2 at a ratio H+/CO 2 of 241. Therefore here the ratio e‚àí/CO 2 is just used for comparison between these four cells. Here the chemical pathway does not take place until a high potential over 4.3 V when the electrolyte was electro-oxidized first. For comparison the CO 2 evolution in the charging process starts from ~3.9 V (Figs. 1‚Äì3) which is too low to electro-oxidize the electrolyte. Therefore the Li 2 CO 3 decomposition at low potential <3.9 V is dominated by the electrochemical pathway instead of by a chemical pathway induced by electrolyte degradation by-products.

Ar flow rate: 0.5 mL min‚àí1. Sweep rate: 0.05 mV s‚àí1.

On the contrary the same experiment but with LiTFSI-tetraglyme electrolyte shows little CO 2 evolution (Fig. 5b) which makes a sharp comparison to the LiPF 6 -EC/EMC electrolyte. In LiTFSI-tetraglyme electrolyte. CO 2 evolved from 4.3 V indicating the decomposition of electrolytes at high potential could induce the chemical decomposition of Li 2 CO 3 . However the ratio e‚àí/CO 2 is 12.29 much higher than that in LiPF 6 -EC/EMC. In addition the total amount of CO 2 is as low as 0.4 Œºmol <2% of the CO 2 evolution in the Super P-Li 2 CO 3 electrode Fig. 1a. This distinct comparison indicates that the reaction mechanisms of Li 2 CO 3 decomposition are completely different in LiPF 6 -EC/EMC and LiTFSI-tetraglyme electrolytes. The chemical pathway proposed by Freiberg is not applicable for tetraglyme-based electrolytes. The difference is due to either the Li salts or the solvents.

To find out whether the Li salts or the solvents make the difference the salts were exchanged in these electrolytes and LiTFSI-EC/EMC and LiFP 6 -tetraglyme were used Fig. 5c and d. Interestingly the LiPF 6 -tetraglyme shows much CO 2 evolution similar to LiPF 6 -EC/EMC. Meanwhile LiTFSI-EC/EMC shows little CO 2 evolution similar to LiTFSI-tetraglyme. The cells using LiPF 6 salt show a large amount of CO 2 evolution. The electrolytes used in this work were all dried and the water concentrations were below 4 ppm (Karl-Fischer titration). Therefore this chemical mechanism could be due to the LiPF 6 salt itself or its impurities because LiPF 6 is difficult to purify53. Freiberg et al. also proposed that the chemical pathway involving LiPF 6 salt41. In the rest of this work we used LiTFSI in tetraglyme as the electrolyte thus excluding any possible effects of LiPF 6 on our results. As little CO 2 was evolved in the Celgard-separated experiment with LiTFSI-based electrolytes our results provide evidence that Li 2 CO 3 decomposition in LiTFSI-tetraglyme electrolytes is dominated by an electrochemical rather than chemical process.

We propose the following reactions for the electrochemical decomposition of Li 2 CO 3 on carbon substrates:

$${{{{{{\rm{Li}}}}}}}_{2}{{{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{3}-2{{{{{{\rm{e}}}}}}}^{-}\to {{{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}+2{{{{{{\rm{Li}}}}}}}^{+}+1/{2}{\\!}^{1}{{{{{{\rm{O}}}}}}}_{2}$$ (5)

$$(1-{{{{{\rm{x}}}}}}/2){\\!}^{1}{{{{{\rm{O}}}}}}_{2}+{{{{{\rm{C}}}}}}\to (1-{{{{{\rm{x}}}}}}){{{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}+{{{{{\rm{x}}}}}}\{{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}}$$ (6)

$${\\!}^{1}{{{{{\rm{O}}}}}}_{2}+{{{{{\rm{electrolyte}}}}}}\to {{{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}+{{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}}+{{{{{\rm{byproducts}}}}}}$$ (7)

Li 2 CO 3 is oxidized at high potentials to form CO 2 and aggressive 1O 2 (Eq. 5) Fig. 6. 1O 2 attacks carbon substrate (Eq. 6) and electrolyte (Eq. 7) simultaneously like incomplete combustion reactions leading to further side reactions forming CO 2 and CO. It should be noted here Eq. (7) is just a schematics equation instead of a proper stoichiometric equation for an elementary reaction because we do not completely know all byproducts from electrolyte decomposition. The exact ratio CO 2 /CO depends on the ratio between formed 1O 2  the carbon substrate/electrolyte namely the electrode composition but not on the cell potentials. Although the carbon substrate is eventually oxidized to CO 2 and CO the carbon does not directly participate in the electro-oxidation of Li 2 CO 3 as has been proposed in the literature28. As we mentioned above the Eq. (2) could be recognized as a combination of Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) when x is equal to zero in Eq. (6). In this case the reactive intermediate 1O 2 reacts with carbon to produce only CO 2 instead of a mixture of CO 2 and CO. However our chemical reaction between 1O 2 and 13C shows both 13CO 2 and 13CO evolution (Supplementary Fig. 11). If a highly reactive intermediate other than 1O 2 forms in the Li 2 CO 3 decomposition and rapidly attacks carbon to just CO 2  Eq. (2) could establish and contribute to a parallel pathway with Eq. (1) in Li 2 CO 3 decomposition. However there is so far no evidence of such a highly reactive intermediate.

Fig. 6: Schematics of the Li 2 CO 3 decomposition on the charging process. Li 2 CO 3 is electro-oxidized to form CO 2 and singlet O 2 (1O 2 ). A possible pathway is proposed in the dash line box. 1O 2 is highly reactive and it attacks the electrolyte and the carbon substrate to form carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide which contribute to ~20% of the overall gas evolution. Full size image

Overall during the charging process of the cell with a Li 2 CO 3 -carbon composite electrode in LiTFSI-tetraglyme electrolyte Li 2 CO 3 decomposition contributes the major CO 2 evolution (~80%) and the carbon substrate and electrolyte decomposition share the rest ~20% of gas evolution. Therefore in the charging process of Li-air batteries and Li-CO 2 batteries the decomposition of carbon substrate and the electrolyte is inevitable and contributes to a significant amount of CO 2 and CO unless the 1O 2 can be suppressed.

Implications for batteries

Although Li 2 CO 3 can be decomposed during the charging process it is accompanied by severe side reactions by 1O 2 (~20% of the total gas evolution) and leads to deterioration of cell performance. Here we focus on Li-air and Li-CO 2 batteries. In Li-air batteries Li 2 CO 3 is a major by-product and it passivates the electrode surface and kills the cells which brings us to a dilemma. On one hand if Li 2 CO 3 is not decomposed during the charging process Li 2 CO 3 will rapidly accumulate during cell cycling and thus completely passivate the electrode. On the other hand if Li 2 CO 3 is decomposed during the charging process it results in more side-reactions and thus accelerates cell deterioration. This effect is more significant in Li-CO 2 batteries because Li 2 CO 3 and carbon form are supposed to be the main discharge products. Therefore a reversible decomposition of Li 2 CO 3 and carbon is desired in the following charging process1617. However during the charging process the discharge reaction cannot be completely reversed because the carbon does not directly participate in the Li 2 CO 3 decomposition reactions. The carbon substrate is oxidized by the 1O 2 intermediate to CO 2 and CO. Meanwhile the aggressive 1O 2 attacks the electrolyte leading to the depletion of the electrolyte and consequently cell failure. If the electrolytes and salts in the cells are sufficiently stable e.g. solid-state electrolyte the molten-salt electrolyte of LiNO 3 -KNO 3  etc the side-reactions with electrolyte could be avoided and 1O 2 quenches to 3O 2 . Recently Zhang‚Äôs group observed the O 2 evolution when charging Li 2 CO 3 in the cell using a solid-state electrolyte54. Due to the stability of inorganic solid-state electrolyte 1O 2 had nothing to attack and eventually was quenched to 3O 2 . However even in this case the 1O 2 would oxidize the carbon substrate and thus the cell deterioration cannot be completely inhibited.

Therefore the key to pursuing a better charging process is to design a catalyst that suppresses the formation of 1O 2 rather than simply facilitates the kinetics of Li 2 CO 3 decomposition and thus decreases the overpotentials. For instance some redox mediators (RM) with moderate O 2 binding energy could be applied to inhibit forming 1O 2 and encourage 3O 2 evolution by replacing the 1O 2 precursor (e.g. CO 4 2‚àí) with a low-energy RM-involved intermediate just like the way 25-di-tert-butyl-14-benzoquinone does to O 2 ‚àí55. Alternatively some solid catalysts with suitable O 2 binding energy could bind 1O 2 precursor (the key reaction intermediator of Li 2 CO 3 decomposition) in order to lower the energy and stabilize the precursor before it transforms to 1O 2 . The ratio of 1O 2 in the final product will decrease when the energy of the 1O 2 precursor decreases.

Very recently Hu‚Äôs group used operando electron paramagnetic resonance to show that Co 3 O 4 inhibited the 1O 2 formation during the charging process of Li-O 2 cells56. Here we added some Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles to the Li 2 CO 3 -Super P composite electrode and then charged the electrode. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 16a some O 2 was identified during the charging process. While the control experiment of charging the Co 3 O 4 electrode itself without Li 2 CO 3 exhibits no O 2 evolution Supplementary Fig. 16b. This result confirms that the Co 3 O 4 catalyst successfully interacts with the precursor of forming 1O 2 during the Li 2 CO 3 decomposition and thus suppresses 1O 2 formation. On the other hand the CO evolution with Co 3 O 4 is only half of that without Co 3 O 4  whereas similar CO 2 evolutions were identified in both experiments. Because CO is from side-reactions of 1O 2 attacks electrolyte/carbon substrate decreased CO evolution confirms that 1O 2 formation was partially inhibited and thus fewer side-reactions of 1O 2 attacking the carbon substrate and the electrolyte were detected than the counterpart without Co 3 O 4  Supplementary Fig. 17. Our results are in good agreement with Hu‚Äôs group results55. Although the 1O 2 formation and CO evolution cannot be completely inhibited the Co 3 O 4 does make some effects by stabilizing the reaction intermediates of forming 1O 2 and thus encouraging the evolution of 3O 2 . This example confirms the feasibility of this strategy to promote the Li 2 CO 3 decomposition with less parasitic 1O 2  however further studies are needed to look for more effective catalysts to avoid the side-reaction caused by 1O 2 .",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZXhwbGFpbmVkL2V4cGxhaW5lZC1oZWFsdGgvZXhwbGFpbmVkLWZvcmV2ZXItY2hlbWljYWxzLWNvbnRhbWluYXRpbmctcmFpbndhdGVyLWdsb2JhbGx5LTgxMDI4NjEv0gGHAWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9leHBsYWluZWQvZXhwbGFpbmVkLWhlYWx0aC9leHBsYWluZWQtZm9yZXZlci1jaGVtaWNhbHMtY29udGFtaW5hdGluZy1yYWlud2F0ZXItZ2xvYmFsbHktODEwMjg2MS9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explained: What are ‚Äòforever chemicals‚Äô that are contaminating rainwater globally?,"A recent study published in Environment Science and Technology has found that rainwater from many places across the globe is contaminated with ‚Äúper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances‚Äù (PFAs) which are called ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù because of their tendency to stick around in the atmosphere rainwater and soil for long periods of time.

What are PFAs?

According to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PFAs are man-made chemicals used to make nonstick cookware water-repellent clothing stain-resistant fabrics cosmetics firefighting forms and many other products that resist grease water and oil. PFAs can migrate to the soil water and air during their production and use. Since most PFAs do not break down they remain in the environment for long periods of time. Some of these PFAs can build up in people and animals if they are repeatedly exposed to the chemicals.

What harm do PFAs cause?

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists a variety of health risks that are attributed to PFA exposure including decreased fertility developmental effects in children interference with body hormones increased cholesterol levels and increased risk of some cancers. Recent research has also revealed that long-term low-level exposure to certain PFAs can make it difficult for humans to build antibodies after being vaccinated against various diseases.

Do we need to be worried about PFAs in the rainwater in India?

While the recently published research article did not include studies of samples collected in India the nature of PFAs and the wide geographical breadth of samples and the nature of PFAs means that the results can be extrapolated to India according to lead author Ian Cousins who spoke to indianexpress.com over an email interaction regarding the same.

How can these chemicals be removed from rainwater?

While there is no known method that can extract and remove PFAs from the atmosphere itself there are many effective albeit expensive methods to remove them from rainwater that has been collected through various rainwater harvesting methods. One way to do this would be to use a filtration system with activated carbon. The activated carbon will need to be removed and replaced regularly. Also the old contaminated material must be destroyed.

Recently Science reported a cheaper method that EPA researchers led by William Dichtel and Brittany Trang stumbled upon by chance. The researchers first placed a PFA compound in a solvent called DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). They then mixed it with sodium hydroxide (lye) in water. They found that when this mixture was heated up to boiling temperature the PFA compound began to degrade. However this method doesn‚Äôt work for all PFAs and only works for certain PFA subsets. The scientists are now looking at ways to scale up their technique to include different types and also large amounts of PFAS.",,,,,,,,,

If you can't beat them pay them ‚Äî at least that's the strategy Sedona Arizona is adopting to turn vacation rentals into local housing.

This past week the City Council officially approved the ""Rent Local"" program which will pay hosts on short-term rental sites like Airbnb and Vrbo to take down their listings and rent long-term ‚Äî leases must span at least one year ‚Äî to local workers instead.

Amounts will range from $3000 for one bedroom in a shared home up to $10000 for a full three-bedroom property according to documents shared with Insider. Property owners will have to find the tenants themselves.

Sedona is one of a handful of communities across the US adopting this approach as a record number of hosts jump into short-term rentals and the country faces an affordable-housing crisis.

""Every day I get calls from folks losing their housing because their landlord is turning their housing into a short-term rental"" Shannon Boone the housing manager for the city of Sedona told Insider. But she emphasized that lawmakers do not intend for the program to be a permanent ban on short-term stays.

""It's not our goal to end short-term rentals it's our goal to house our local workforce"" she said. Official city estimates currently show there are 6600 housing units in Sedona and landlords are using just under 1000 of them for short-term rentals according to documents shared with Insider.

Valeria Lara a restaurant worker in Sedona told CBS 5 Arizona that living in town would be a dramatic change for her.

""It would mean a lot honestly because like gas is super expensive now so putting a bunch of miles on my car doing a bunch of oil changes and this and that it would help a lot"" she told the outlet.

Other communities that have considered cash-for-pivot programs include Winter Park Colorado which set aside over $300000 to incentivize 40 more short-term rental units to help with the housing crunch.

Woodstock Vermont approved offering short-term rental owners $3000 to sign a one-year lease with a tenant and $7000 if they sign a two-year lease. Additionally Truckee California has offered $10000 rewards to property owners who convert to long-term leases.

Summit County Colorado a ski destination locals know as ""Colorado's Playground"" was one of the first communities to start a similar program. Last October the county launched ""Lease to Locals"" and in March 2022 the local government extended the program by another year.

Jason Dietz the Summit County housing director stresses that the plan is a ""Band-Aid"" not a permanent fix while lawmakers develop longer-term projects and build more housing stock.

""It's really just one tool in the toolbox. There's no quick fixes for affordable housing"" he told Insider.

Only Summit County landlords that legally licensed their short-term rentals prior to October 2021 are eligible for the program. But if they find a locally-employed tenant who works at least 30 hours per week they can earn up to $20000 for a long-term lease.

After a year Dietz says the program has housed 140 workers from industries spanning restaurants medical support resorts and hospitality and retail. The program mostly succeeded by finding the slice of hosts who were unsure about continuing to run vacation rentals.

""There's been a lot of positive reaction from hosts that maybe had been considering long-term renting. This was a way to try it"" he said.

One group that did not have as much of a positive reaction was current property owners with long-term tenants. Dietz said they've explored how to keep that stock available for local workers as well.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL2J1ZmZhbG9uZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3doZXJlLWFyZS1hbGwtdGhlLWFpcmJuYi1yZW50YWxzLWJ1ZmZhbG8tb2ZmaWNpYWxzLXVuYWJsZS10by10cmFjay10aGVtLWRlc3BpdGUtbGF3L2FydGljbGVfYTIwYjRhM2EtMTQzNC0xMWVkLTgzMWYtOTNkYjA1NzQ5NDQ4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where are all the Airbnb rentals? Buffalo officials unable to track them despite law,"A Buffalo ordinance passed nearly three years ago requires residences or rooms rented to others for short-term stays to be registered with the city and inspected.

But only 50 properties are listed in the city‚Äôs short-term rental registry according to records obtained by The News through a Freedom of Information Law request.

That's only a small fraction of how many properties are being rented out in Buffalo.

AirDNA a data analytics company found 913 listings in July meaning a vast majority of the city's short-term rentals arranged through Airbnb and other services are at unlicensed properties.

The reason?

A lack of data according to the city.

Airbnb for example does not provide the precise address of a listing until after a booking has been confirmed. The rental locations on its map are approximations. And it doesn‚Äôt generally provide specific addresses to governments.

When the Buffalo Common Council passed the regulation negotiations with Airbnb were initially fruitful said Cathy Amdur the city's commissioner of permits and inspections.

But Airbnb backed off when asked to share data.

Because of its refusal to share the information and the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic rollout of the ordinance has been slow Amdur said.

The city is working on a request for proposals to find a third-party company to track rental registrations an approach Niagara Falls has taken.

Amdur noted that Airbnb is not the only provider of short-term rentals in Buffalo. HomeStay Vrbo Craigslist and even some companies focused on hotels have entered the short-term rental market like Booking.com. Still the vast majority of short-term rentals are listed on Airbnb. None of the other services had more than 100 listings that weren‚Äôt also on Airbnb.

When asked about Airbnb‚Äôs policy of not sharing data with some cities its spokesperson said in an email ‚ÄúAirbnb has worked closely with the City of Buffalo to support hosts‚Äô awareness of their obligations under the local ordinance.""

Ensuring safety

While cities like Boston and New York have regulated short-term rentals in part to prevent negative effects on the housing market Buffalo‚Äôs ordinance passed in November 2019 focused more on protecting the safety of guests by giving the city a means to stop dangerous or unreasonable rentals and to prevent absentee landlords.

‚ÄúThis legislation was not passed to be punitive to individuals that wanted to have short-term rentals‚Äù said Delaware Council Member Joel Feroleto who with South Council Member Christopher P. Scanlon introduced the ordinance. ‚ÄúWe did this so that there could be a registration process to ensure the safety of guests who are visiting the City of Buffalo.‚Äù

The ordinance mandates annual inspections of all short-term rental properties. It requires a special use permit for properties not occupied by their owner in areas of the city zoned as N-2R or N-3R residential areas. Any owners who live outside Erie County must provide contact information for someone who does live in the county. It also explicitly bans rentals in apartment buildings and other multiple residential dwelling units.

In order for a registration system to work however the city needs to know which residences are not in compliance.

In 2014 the New York Attorney General‚Äôs Office investigated Airbnb‚Äôs operations in New York City and found ‚Äúas much as 72% of Airbnb reservations over the last several years violated New York law.‚Äù New York City passed a law in 2018 requiring Airbnb to provide information about listings so it can enforce its laws. Airbnb promptly sued and reached a settlement in 2020. That settlement established the rules by which the country‚Äôs most populous city has been able to monitor listings.

In Buffalo the current system is built entirely on reports from neighbors. When the city receives a report of a listing via its 311 hotline the Department of Permits and Inspections reaches out to the property owner and makes them aware the property requires a license. Amdur stressed that a 311 report does not require the caller to witness a crime or other violation.

Without past data however the owner can simply remove their listing and claim it was never offered before the city can take action. This Amdur said is the reason it‚Äôs important for the city to have historical data.

In cases where the city needs to remove a listing due to noncompliance it reaches out to the listing agency through an email. Generally though the city takes it up with the owner directly Amdur said.

""Based on the experiences I've seen most of the operators want good guests"" Feroleto said. ""They don't want problems at their property. And I think the owners for the most part have done a good job in maintaining the property vetting the guests so there's a minimal negative impact on the property and the neighborhood.

Feroleto said the bill has given the city the ability to step in when it's needed.

At one estate and gardens in the Berkshires you have the option to stay overnight in the tower of a building that‚Äôs been affectionately called the ‚ÄúGingerbread House.‚Äù

Located on the larger Santarella Estate and Gardens and situated in the tiny town of Tyringham the tower section of the Gingerbread House is currently run by couple Joshua Williams and Shaun Mosley as lodging through Airbnb.

The entire property was transformed a century ago by Sir Henry Hudson Kitson an English-American sculptor best known for the Lexington Minuteman statue and Plymouth Rock Maiden statue ‚Äî with the estate and gardens becoming the sculptor‚Äôs primary focus for the last 25 years of his life using several of the spaces as art studios according to Santarella‚Äôs website.

The Gingerbread House‚Äôs 80-ton asphalt shingled storybook roof is its most striking feature Santarella‚Äôs website stated while a cluster of other neighboring buildings designed in the same storybook-inspired theme were also created by Kitson including a cottage and a detached tower.

Guests to Santarella can also stay in two other buildings overnight on the property ‚Äî Kitson‚Äôs historic farmhouse and the detached tiny tower ‚Äî both available to book through Airbnb along with the Gingerbread House tower.

The Gingerbread House tower can accommodate up to four guests according to its Airbnb listing and contains two bedrooms and one bathroom.

Described as ‚Äúmagical‚Äù ‚Äúnewly renovated‚Äù and ‚Äúone-of-a-kind‚Äù it features an open concept living space kitchenette cozy eating area and a third story bedchamber up a winding staircase according to Airbnb. There is also a bohemian bedroom with a full-sized bed behind a sliding door.

Meanwhile the detached tiny tower ‚Äî just 350 square feet in size ‚Äî can accommodate two guests in a one bedroom one bathroom space according to its Airbnb listing which invites guests to ‚Äúlive out your own fairytale‚Äù and describes the tower as ‚Äúwhimsical‚Äù and ‚Äúromantic.‚Äù

It features a kitchenette sitting area and a dining room which looks out to a babbling brook on the first floor ‚Äî while in the upper bedchamber guests can find a canopied bed with ‚Äúamazing views‚Äù through large mill windows that makes you fell like you‚Äôre living in a ‚Äútree-house.‚Äù

Kitson‚Äôs rustic 18th century farmhouse the final rentable overnight accommodations on the estate and gardens is two stories tall and features four bedrooms accessible via a central staircase and hallway along with two full baths and a downstairs powder room according to Airbnb.

Other notable features include a spacious living room with a stone fireplace a formal dining room a laundry room a screened porch and a sunny nook with a pastoral view to a neighboring farmhouse. Kitson‚Äôs farmhouse can accommodate up to nine guests its Airbnb listing said.

All the buildings are also set amid the larger property‚Äôs ‚Äúenchanting garden‚Äù replete with exotic plants and fish Santarella‚Äôs website added.

The property has changed hands several times over the years since Kitston‚Äôs death and has accommodated various different functions such as previously housing art galleries as well as acting as a museum dedicated to Kitson and his sculptures its website said.

Mosley and Williams the current owners first stumbled upon Santarella in 2020 while wanting to find a ‚Äúmagical property‚Äù in a Berkshires town with a community they hoped would be similar to where they grew up in upstate New York according to their website.

Mosley and Williams said online that they began to fall in love with the area ‚Äî checking off all the boxes they were looking for in a place to live ‚Äî and began formulating their dream to own and operate a small business where the pair could host guests and events.

The couple said on their website that they got engaged after purchasing Santarella and have been planning their own fairytale wedding at Santarella ‚Äî a service Mosley and Williams also provide to other couples there along with special events planning according to Santarella‚Äôs Facebook page.

Santarella is located 3.5 miles off of Exit 2 on the Massachusetts Turnpike and is a two hour drive from Boston and a two and a half hour drive from New York City according to the estate and gardens‚Äô website.

The property‚Äôs Airbnb listings highlight its accessibility to attractions in the Berkshires such as hiking trails like the nearby Appalachian Trail in addition to nearby ponds for swimming and kayaking and ski trails and ski areas in the winter.

The listings also highlight cultural attractions within reach such as Jacob‚Äôs Pillow the Norman Rockwell Museum and Tanglewood among others in nearby and neighboring towns.

‚ÄúTwo reasons‚Äù says Anthony Johnson founder and CEO of the biotech start-up Kodikaz Therapeutic Solutions about the decision to launch his company at an incubator in Lower Manhattan. ‚ÄúWe knew we wanted to set up in New York City because of the burgeoning biotech scene and all of the infrastructure in place for biotech to be a success‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAlso we were the inaugural Golden Ticket winner.‚Äù

Manhattan biotech space by the numbers 12 Number of buildings 7.7% Space availability 1.4 million Total square footage of laboratory space 2.1 million Square feet of space planned $114 Average asking rent per square foot Note: Figures represent space built exclusively for laboratory use. Source: CBRE Research 2021.

That Golden Ticket was issued in 2020 by BioLabs at NYU Langone the incubator offering Kodikaz free rent for a year. The award was sponsored by the big drug firm Boehringer Ingelheim.

With technology from Emory University Kodikaz is working on a system for delivering cell and gene therapy with DNA fragments. Called Zip-Code the platform enables targeted delivery of a wider variety of payloads than can be achieved using viruses and other standard delivery methods the firm says.

Kodikaz‚Äîthe name derives from the Greek word kodikas meaning ‚Äúcode‚Äù‚Äîis part of a new wave of start-ups in New York City where the vision of establishing a Cambridge Massachusetts‚Äìlike biotech center with technology from local research institutions mobilized development efforts a dozen years ago.

Now with an expanding landscape of laboratory space the Big Apple is beginning to attract entrepreneurs from elsewhere. Some start-ups are choosing the city over the well-established hubs of Cambridge San Francisco and San Diego.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs come a long way‚Äù Johnson says expressing enthusiasm for recruitment prospects in the city as Kodikaz moves forward. ‚ÄúWe want to be part of something that is actually growing. New York mirrors the growth we see in our company.‚Äù

Johnson expects his staff of 9 to expand to 25 in the next year and a half. The search is underway for larger lab space in Manhattan where such space is developing rapidly.

From center to centers

Intra-Cellular Therapies a specialist in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders moved into the city‚Äôs center of biotech activity in 2014 when it began leasing lab space in the West Tower of the Alexandria Center for Life Science a two-tower campus that Alexandria Real Estate Equities had opened in 2010. Tenants in the East Tower which had been the first to open included Eli Lilly and Company Roche and a branch of Pfizer‚Äôs Centers for Therapeutic Innovation (CTI) through which the drug firm collaborates with academic researchers.

Several real estate development companies are repurposing buildings in Manhattan as laboratories and office space for life sciences companies. One is Taconic Partners which opened the Hudson Research Center in 2017. Taconic and its partner Silverstein Properties converted six floors in a Warner Bros. film editing and processing facility‚Äîcalled the Movie Lab building‚Äîon Manhattan‚Äôs West Side. Taconic has two other sites including one on the East Side under development with partners. The firm launched a life sciences subsidiary Elevate Research Properties earlier this year.

We want to be part of something that is actually growing. New York mirrors the growth we see in our company. Anthony Johnson CEO Kodikaz

Last year Deerfield Management repurposed an office building as life science research space called Cure not far from the Alexandria Center. Janus Property and J.P. Morgan Asset Management are working on a similar facility in Harlem.

And Alexandria plans to keep building. With its two towers totaling 728000 sq. ft. (67600 m2) at nearly full occupancy the firm plans to build a third 550000 sq. ft. tower.

Outside Manhattan the 500000 sq. ft. BioBAT in the Brooklyn Army Terminal is operated by New York‚Äôs Downstate Medical Center and ELabNYC an entrepreneurship mentoring program. It began leasing lab space to biotech firms in 2008. And three real estate developers including Alexandria are bringing a total of 650000 sq. ft. of lab space to Long Island City Queens.

‚ÄúThe dramatic increase in activity in the last 5 years is directly tied to investment that the city and state made since 2016‚Äù says Maria Gotsch CEO of the Partnership Fund for New York City a nonprofit that works with New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) and the Empire State Development agency.

Gotsch points to NYCEDC‚Äôs LifeSci NYC a $500 million initiative announced in 2016 that offers tax incentives to promote investment by real estate developers as well as R&D tax credits for start-ups. New York State followed with a $620 million life sciences incentive program in 2017. NYCEDC announced an additional $500 million investment last year.

Spotlight on start-ups

Incubators supporting start-ups appeared as early as the late 1990s when the Audubon Business and Technology Center hosted by Columbia University uptown in Washington Heights opened. In 2013 Sam Sia a Columbia biomedical engineer and Christine Kovich a financial services entrepreneur launched the Harlem Biospace biotechnology incubator. But the concept has accelerated in recent years.

JLabs operated by a division of Johnson & Johnson opened on one floor of the New York Genome Center in 2018 with the help of $17 million in state funding. BioLabs a Cambridge-based company opened BioLabs at NYU Langone the next year with $5 million from LifeSci NYC and backing from NYU Langone Health Bristol Myers Squibb and other corporations. Both are in Lower Manhattan‚Äôs Hudson Square neighborhood home to Google‚Äôs new complex.

Keeping pace Alexandria has also launched an incubator venture installing the first Alexandria LaunchLabs on half a floor of the center‚Äôs West Tower in 2017. Last year Alexandria opened a LaunchLabs in partnership with Columbia University on one floor of a building owned by the university‚Äôs medical school‚Äîspace once occupied by the Audubon incubator. LaunchLabs now has operations in all the major US biotech hubs.

Managers at the incubators are enthusiastic about the unique environment for biotech start-ups in New York. ‚ÄúYou have diversity here‚Äù says Melinda Richter founder and global head of JLabs at Johnson & Johnson Innovation. ‚ÄúIf we are going to tackle the disparities of health we need to think about all communities and all communities are represented here in New York.‚Äù

Then there‚Äôs the entrepreneurial spirit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like ‚ÄòWe are going to do whatever it takes to get it done.‚Äô Never say die‚Äù Richter says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs New York.‚Äù

Biotech presents unique challenges however. ‚ÄúIn tech you give a couple of guys a couple of computers a couple hundred thousand dollars and a couple of years later they have a project they can sell to Microsoft Google or Facebook for $200 million.‚Äù Richter says. ‚ÄúIn life science when you start a new company you need specialized infrastructure you need specialized capital equipment you need special permits and licenses.‚Äù

JLabs is designed to support start-ups in all these areas‚Äîbeginning with equipped lab space according to Richter. ‚ÄúWhen you get into JLabs you can start pipetting in 24 hours‚Äù she claims. The incubator also provides networking fundraising and technical support. Each client is assigned a mentor at Johnson & Johnson called a JPal.

Other incubators provide similar space and networking amenities. Clients typically make use of dedicated and shared labs and equipment residing for an average of 2 years before moving to larger space elsewhere‚Äîa move requiring success both in research and in obtaining additional financing.

‚ÄúWe have all the tools for foundational research‚Äù says Glennis Mehra director of BioLabs at NYU Langone which hosts two floors once occupied by ImClone Systems an early New York City biotech success story. ‚ÄúThe model has proven itself in the short time we‚Äôve been open‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe have graduated four companies very successfully.‚Äù All stayed in the city taking space in the Alexandria Center Deerfield‚Äôs Cure lab space and the Hudson Research Center Mehra says.

About half the companies at BioLabs are working in traditional therapeutic areas Mehra says. Others‚Äîlike C16 Biosciences a firm pioneering sustainable alternatives to palm oil that recently moved from BioLabs into the Hudson Research Center‚Äîare active in other areas of biotech.

Applicants to the incubator go through a rigorous selection process during which they are vetted by a panel of New York University and NYCEDC representatives as well as by corporate sponsors of BioLabs. ‚ÄúI like to believe we are curating for a particular type of founder and a particular type of scientific endeavor‚Äù says Mehra herself an entrepreneur in the health-care arena. ‚ÄúI like to see someone who can articulate their proposition and sell. If you can sell me on it you can sell anyone.‚Äù

Movers

Brian Thomas executive director of Alexandria LaunchLabs at Columbia University watched developments in New York City over the past decade at his first job in the city at Pfizer‚Äôs CTI at the Alexandria Center. He came to New York after working as a researcher at various biotech companies in Cambridge for 14 years.

‚ÄúI had been trying for many years to live in New York City and could never find a job‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was really for academics and I wasn‚Äôt ready to go back and get my PhD at the time.‚Äù But he recognized the potential of a program like CTI that supports academic investigators in New York‚Äîand he made the leap.

Thomas says he went in with his eyes wide open. ‚ÄúWhat I saw very quickly was how actively the city Alexandria and the institutions were working toward making New York City as much of a hub as they possibly could‚Äù he says.

Witnessing the growth of opportunity in the city since he arrived Thomas was enthusiastic about moving to LaunchLabs at Columbia. ‚ÄúOne of the reasons I took this job is that it made so much sense to put one of these launch labs right in the middle of one of the major academic institutions that creates companies.‚Äù Most of the 10 start-ups at the incubator spun out of Columbia.

But New York City is no Cambridge Thomas says. ‚ÄúNew York will not have a central Cambridge hub presence. We should think of Manhattan as many hubs. It took me a while to get my head around that. You have to decide which part of the city you want to live in and do research in.‚Äù

Others who have witnessed developments in New York City firsthand are the leaders of companies that grew up and stayed. Sharon Mates cofounder and CEO of Intra-Cellular which launched in 2002 has seen it all.

‚ÄúWe started the company in New York because we started it with technology from Paul Greengard‚Äôs lab at Rockefeller University‚Äù Mates says. Intra-Cellular focuses on nerve cell signaling pathways elucidated by Greengard who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000. But finding a home in the city wasn‚Äôt easy.

New York will not have a central Cambridge hub presence. We should think of Manhattan as many hubs. Brian Thomas executive director Alexandria LaunchLabs at Columbia University

‚ÄúFirst of all space was extremely difficult to get‚Äù Mates recalls. ‚ÄúThe Alexandria Center didn‚Äôt exist yet.‚Äù The fledgling company lucked into Columbia‚Äôs Audubon incubator; it sublet space and then was able to rent directly.

Intra-Cellular grew and was able to move in 2014 into the West Tower of the Alexandria Center where it now has 40000 sq. ft.

The company has also expanded out of town. Its first drug Caplyta was approved for schizophrenia in 2019 and bipolar disorder in 2021. ‚ÄúWe have a whole sales force now and they‚Äôre all over the place‚Äù Mates says. ‚ÄúBut the research is maintained at the Alexandria Center. It‚Äôs a great place for the research people to be and it does give us a chance to hire people coming from the academic institutions because they all want to stay in New York.‚Äù

Kallyope named after the Greek muse presiding over poetry song and the arts and sciences moved into the Alexandria Center when the company was formed in 2015. The firm employs technologies including gene sequencing neural imaging and cellular and molecular biology to study neural and hormonal signaling between the gut and the brain. Kallyope was founded by three Columbia scientists including Richard Axel a recipient of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

‚ÄúEarly on there was some discussion of having the company launched in the Bay Area or potentially in Boston‚Äù says Nancy Thornberry Kallyope‚Äôs founding CEO and current chair of R&D. ‚ÄúBut there was a decision to stay in New York in part because the founders were there and we envisioned that they would be intimately involved in helping to guide the science particularly in the early years.‚Äù

The Alexandria Center was one of very few options at the time and perhaps the only one with a vivarium which Kallyope required for in vivo biology. The company launched with 6 employees and has grown to about 100. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve taken additional space there on four occasions‚Äù Thornberry says. It now occupies half a floor in the West Tower.

Thornberry says Kallyope identified New York City‚Äôs untapped talent pool as another advantage of setting up there rather than in Boston or one of the California hubs.

‚ÄúThere is not a lot of competition for talent and there are so many remarkable research institutions in New York City as well as so many amazing scientists and clinicians in the New Jersey pharma corridor and other places that are relatively local‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe envisioned that it would be relatively easy to recruit and that has proven to be the case.‚Äù

Kallyope has managed to keep annual employee turnover below 3% she says far lower than the churn in the major life sciences hubs.

The next wave

Some of the more recent members of the New York City biotech community have diverged from the script of launching from local research institutions though they appreciate their proximity.

Black Diamond Therapeutics graduated last year from BioLabs at NYU Langone to the Alexandria Center. The company whose cofounders met at OSI Pharmaceuticals launched with funding from New York‚Äìarea venture capital investors and with its own technology for discovering drugs targeting allosteric mutations that drive cancer.

Black Diamond which has a candidate in Phase 1 clinical trials for non-small-cell lung cancer and glioblastoma opened its business headquarters in Cambridge in order to mix with the Boston area‚Äôs community of experienced biotech entrepreneurs. But the firm has made a long-term commitment to research in New York City according to Elizabeth Buck a Black Diamond cofounder and its chief scientific officer.

‚ÄúNew York is a smaller community for biotech but if you look at the number of academic institutions with investigators who are starting companies who are eager to collaborate the environment certainly is as rich as in the Bay Area or in Boston‚Äù Buck says.

C16 Black Diamond‚Äôs classmate at BioLabs was conceived in Cambridge where its three cofounders met and began thinking about palm oil alternatives.

The ‚Äúaccidental entrepreneurs‚Äù came to New York with their own science looking for a biotech environment less narrowly focused on therapeutics than those in Boston or the Bay Area CEO Shara Ticku says. ‚ÄúWe looked at our options and New York City became very compelling. The city and state were actively trying to build an ecosystem there. It was a really exciting growth space.‚Äù

The New York City area is also home to many of the consumer product companies C16 targets as potential customers. Ticku loves being in New York she adds and finds that many talented scientists do as well.

And just entering the JLabs incubator Linus Biotechnology a start-up spun out of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is looking forward to growing in New York City. The company which specializes in exposome research is debuting with momentum having been granted a breakthrough designation by the US Food and Drug Administration for the first exposomic biomarker for detecting autism at birth.

Linus named after Linus Pauling and the Greek mythological figure associated with musical dynamics already has two deals with major drug companies according to founder and CEO Manish Arora a professor of environmental medicine at the Icahn School.

Arora committed to New York City largely because of the diversity of the population a key to his research and one that can‚Äôt be matched even in a city like Boston. ‚ÄúI have access to a 50000-patient biobank at Mount Sinai Hospital‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn East Harlem there are the poorest recent immigrants. I have patients who have just come from Africa. You walk 10 blocks there are some of the wealthiest postcodes.‚Äù

The environment mirrors Linus‚Äôs diversity says Arora who notes that its cofounders came to the city from India Ireland and Australia.

The bottom line for Linus is much the same as it is for Kodikaz the next block over in Hudson Square: the city‚Äôs generative vibe which is especially in evidence at its venture-creating academic institutions Arora says.",,,,,,,,,
ALGN,Align Technology,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZGVudGlzdHJ5LmNvLnVrLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvbWlzbWlsZS1pcy1zdHJvbmdlci10b2dldGhlci10cmFuc2Zvcm1pbmctYWxpZ25lci10aGVyYXB5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mismile is 'stronger together' ‚Äì transforming aligner therapy - Dentistry,"21 August 2022

Seb Evans went along to the latest Mismile annual conference to see why practices are queueing up to join the network.

Dentists go to university and graduate with all the clinical skills they need to excel in practice.

But it‚Äôs often only when they become the principal of a practice that they realise how much work is required to actually run the business.

Marketing agencies business coaches and courses all offer the help needed to make the transition from associate to principal but sometimes the support of a network that has been there and done it is the best solution.

Mismile is one such network.

The number of practices that have joined the Mismile network has now reached over 100 and the waiting list to join continues to grow.

That‚Äôs one of the many reasons there was a buzz and excitement leading up to the latest annual conference with 100s attending.

‚ÄòToday delegates will learn all the best practices‚Äô said Sandeep Kumar Mismile founder and CEO.

‚ÄòFor example how to set up a correct patient journey end to end and how to look after leads and the team.

‚ÄòAlso how to build a winning team and how to run a profitable Invisalign business.

‚ÄòBecause of my relationship with Invisalign and collaboration delegates will know first-hand what the future of Invisalign looks like if there are any innovations and what‚Äôs coming through.

‚ÄòThis is a perfect opportunity. They‚Äôll hear things that nobody knows about.‚Äô

Surrounded with inspiration

The title of the conference was Stronger Together.

Mismile‚Äôs philosophy focuses on there being three stakeholders ‚Äì members Align Technology and Mismile.

‚ÄòAnd it has to be a win-win for everybody‚Äô Sandeep points out.

And that‚Äôs how the day was set up; simple practical tips that attendees could take away and implement into their practices immediately whether they were a Mismile member or not.

Speakers talked about their experiences introducing Invisalign into their practice and how they got the team on board.

There were talks on the importance of marketing and how best to utilise social media from Digimax‚Äôs Shaz Memon.

Align‚Äôs very own executive vice president and managing director EMEA Markus Sebastian rounded off the day. He discussed the future plans and innovations from Align and how dental practices could fit into that.

‚ÄòThe day has been brilliant so far‚Äô Christopher Hajistilly principal at Peartree Clinic Welwyn said.

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt say it about many people but I feel that Sandeep is very inspirational. His talk this morning was absolutely brilliant. He had a lot of people crying when he was talking about those who helped him along the way. Even just for that it was worth coming.

‚ÄòThe other keynote speakers have been excellent. When you‚Äôve got leaders and you surround yourself with leaders even if you can‚Äôt do everything they can do if you can apply some of the principles it can ultimately lead to success and that‚Äôs what we want.‚Äô

‚ÄòKick back and enjoy‚Äô

Following a busy day of lectures and learning it‚Äôs always nice to kick back and enjoy the evening.

The Mismile team had everything covered in this respect.

A black tie event meant everybody could get together network and enjoy themselves late into the evening.

The surprise entertainment had people dancing through the evening too.

Not only that but those that attended managed to raise over ¬£132000 for Operation Smile Mismile‚Äôs chosen charity partner.

‚ÄòI brought my team along because the Mismile network is an amazing network for people who want to grow their Invisalign cases‚Äô Aisha Ahmed Sale Dental Spa practice principal said.

‚ÄòI‚Äôm on the waiting list I‚Äôve not joined Mismile yet. But I came here and brought my team along so we can get some gems. Now we‚Äôll take them back to the practice and implement them.

‚ÄòAfter today I‚Äôm really hoping we can join the Mismile network in the near future.‚Äô

Zoe Brown who came all the way from Edinburgh Gums and Teeth to The Belfry in Birmingham to be at the conference added: ‚ÄòMismile has been great.

‚ÄòWe are dentists not marketers. We have no idea how to go about marketing.

‚ÄòMismile‚Äôs been really good at generating leads. And they‚Äôre really supportive as well they give you a lot of help and guidance. It‚Äôs really great.‚Äô

Snowflake (SNOW 0.70%) has taken investors on a wild ride since its IPO in September 2020. The cloud-based data warehousing company went public at $120 per share then more than doubled on its first trade to $245. It attracted so much attention for two reasons: It was growing like a weed and it was backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Salesforce (CRM -0.46%).

Snowflake's stock eventually soared to an all-time high of $401.85 last November. But today it trades at around $170 per share. The high-flying stock dropped back to the earth as investors fretted over its slowing growth lack of profits and high valuations -- which made it a soft target for the bears while rising interest rates drove investors toward more conservative investments.

Nevertheless Snowflake is still growing a lot faster than many of its cloud-based peers -- and it expects that growth to continue through the end of the decade.

Snowflake is currently worth about $54 billion so it's still dwarfed by cloud giants like Alphabet (GOOG -0.04%) (GOOGL 0.12%) which has a market cap of nearly $1.6 trillion. But could Snowflake continue growing and become even more valuable than Alphabet by the end of the decade? Let's review Snowflake's business model growth rates and valuations to decide.

Why is Snowflake growing so quickly?

Snowflake's revenue rose 174% in fiscal 2020 124% in fiscal 2021 and 106% to $1.22 billion in fiscal 2022 which ended this January. The secular expansion of the data warehousing market is driving that rapid growth.

In the past large companies often stored their data on various types of software across different computing platforms. That fragmentation created ""data silos"" which reduced their overall efficiency.

Snowflake breaks down those silos and pulls that data into a centralized cloud-based warehouse where it can be easily accessed by third-party apps and data visualization platforms like Salesforce's Tableau and Microsoft's (MSFT 0.01%) Power BI. This approach helps companies make better data-driven decisions.

What are Snowflake's long-term plans?

Snowflake generated 94% of its revenue from its product segment last year. It expects its product revenue to grow from $1.14 billion in fiscal 2022 to about $10 billion in fiscal 2029 which implies its top line can grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36% over the next seven years.

By fiscal 2029 Snowflake expects approximately 1400 of its customers to generate over $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenues by fiscal 2029 compared to only 184 million-dollar customers in fiscal 2022. It also expects its annual revenues from that high-value cohort to rise from $3.5 million in fiscal 2022 to $5.5 million in fiscal 2029.

Snowflake already served 241 of the Fortune 500 companies and 488 of the Global 2000 companies at the end of fiscal 2022 but it expects to gain even more large customers as they upgrade their aging IT infrastructure.

Snowflake is still deeply unprofitable. But between fiscal 2022 and 2029 it expects its adjusted gross product margin to expand from 69% to 78% and for its adjusted operating margin to rise from negative 3% to positive 20%. That forecast implies it can maintain its pricing power as it expands.

But Snowflake won't be worth more than Alphabet

Snowflake still trades at 27 times this year's sales and it's doubtful it can maintain that frothy price-to-sales ratio if its annual revenue growth slows down to about 30% to 40%. If Snowflake generates $10 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029 -- and its stock is trading at a more reasonable 15 times forward sales -- it would be worth about $150 billion in calendar 2029.

But that would still be less than a tenth of Alphabet's current market cap. Furthermore Alphabet's valuation could also climb much higher by the end of the decade as its core advertising and cloud businesses continue to expand. Simply put Snowflake won't come close to matching Alphabet's market cap by 2030 even if it checks off all its long-term goals.

But investors shouldn't assume Snowflake can achieve those goals. Snowflake's success is already prompting Amazon (AMZN -0.64%) Microsoft and Google to upgrade their own cloud-based data warehousing services -- which are bundled into their market-leading cloud infrastructure platforms. Snowflake also runs its platform on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure and Google Cloud -- so it's still ironically paying service fees to its top competitors. If those cloud giants get serious about challenging Snowflake they could hike their hosting fees while undercutting Snowflake's prices.

Snowflake's stock could double or triple by the end of the decade even as its growth cools off and its valuations decline. However it's still expensive after its 50% decline this year and it could continue to underperform many other cloud stocks which are trading at more reasonable valuations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWF5dHYuY29tL25ld3MvdGhlLXlvdXR1YmUtcHJheWVyLWNoYW5uZWwtc3RhcnRlZC1kdXJpbmctY292aWQtdGhhdHMtYmVjb21lLWEtZ2xvYmFsLW1vdmVtZW50L2FydGljbGVfZDUxZDcxNDItMWFjNi01Mzk0LWJhYmEtMDgxOGZkOGE5MDk1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The YouTube prayer channel started during Covid that's become a global movement,"You have permission to edit this article.

Alphabet (GOOG -0.04%) (GOOGL 0.12%) and Amazon (AMZN -0.64%) are two of the most influential technology companies in the world. On the heels of turbulence for the market and growth stocks in particular this year each company's valuation is also down significantly from its previous high.

With these industry leaders potentially on track for big rebounds investors could wonder which stock looks like the better buy at today's prices. Read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors have different views on which company will be a better performer for your portfolio.

The case for Amazon

Keith Noonan: When it comes to innovation Amazon has an absolutely incredible track record. The company built an online bookstore into the leading overall online retail platform and it continues to shape the direction of the e-commerce world. The tech giant also spearheaded the evolution of cloud-infrastructure services with Amazon Web Services and the technologies it provides are at the heart of the modern internet and the evolution of cloud-based software.

Amazon also has a fast-growing digital advertising business that has plenty of room for long-term expansion. Because the company controls the leading online-retail marketplace it has some natural advantages in the ads space and it's still in the early stages of leveraging these strengths to build on its position in the category.

The company is also a leader in smart speakers and voice-based operating systems and its move to acquire iRobot should bolster its position in the consumer devices category and augment broader strategic initiatives. Between its various products and services for consumers and businesses Amazon has access to an incredible amount of data and this should help the company take advantage of opportunities in artificial intelligence and continue mapping out new growth strategies and ways to capitalize on synergies between its businesses.

Amazon's cloud segment is highly profitable and continues to grow at an impressive clip and advancements in automation and robotics could ultimately make its market-leading e-commerce business much more profitable. With big opportunities in its two core businesses growth potential in other categories and a penchant for market-defining innovation Amazon looks like a great buy today.

The case for Alphabet

Parkev Tatevosian: The factors that help make Alphabet an excellent stock to buy are that it holds a dominant position in a massive industry and sells at a relatively inexpensive valuation. Indeed Alphabet is home to Google the most powerful search engine worldwide. That's a critically important business to dominate because so many purchase decisions start with an internet search.

It can partly explain how Alphabet has expanded its revenue from $46 billion in 2012 to $258 billion in 2021. More importantly it helped boost operating income from $13.8 billion to $78.7 billion in that same time. Businesses with less dominant positions frequently grapple with competitors which works toward lower profits. Alphabet's search engine makes money through advertising. Companies pay Alphabet to have their websites listed near the top of search engine queries.

It's estimated that advertisers will spend $838 billion globally in 2022 an 8.4% increase from the year before. That massive figure allowed Alphabet to expand beyond its $258 billion revenue in 2021. If it operated in a smaller market it could approach a ceiling much faster making an investment less lucrative.

Despite these excellent prospects Alphabet is trading relatively inexpensively at a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 25.6 and a price-to-earnings ratio of 22.8. These are below its historical averages through the last five years.

Which big tech stock should you buy today?

Unless you're only interested in owning one of these big tech companies in your portfolio this is a case where buying both stocks could be the right move. Alphabet's top positions in search digital advertising and mobile give it clear avenues to long-term expansion. Meanwhile Amazon's market-leading e-commerce and cloud computing businesses give it a strong growth engine and the company has proven it can successfully branch into new categories. Both of these technology leaders look poised to tap into secular growth trends and each stock stands a good chance of being a long-term winner."

Alphabet (GOOG -0.04%) (GOOGL 0.12%) and Amazon (AMZN -0.64%) are two of the most influential technology companies in the world. On the heels of turbulence for the market and growth stocks in particular this year each company's valuation is also down significantly from its previous high.

With these industry leaders potentially on track for big rebounds investors could wonder which stock looks like the better buy at today's prices. Read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors have different views on which company will be a better performer for your portfolio.

The case for Amazon

Keith Noonan: When it comes to innovation Amazon has an absolutely incredible track record. The company built an online bookstore into the leading overall online retail platform and it continues to shape the direction of the e-commerce world. The tech giant also spearheaded the evolution of cloud-infrastructure services with Amazon Web Services and the technologies it provides are at the heart of the modern internet and the evolution of cloud-based software.

Amazon also has a fast-growing digital advertising business that has plenty of room for long-term expansion. Because the company controls the leading online-retail marketplace it has some natural advantages in the ads space and it's still in the early stages of leveraging these strengths to build on its position in the category.

The company is also a leader in smart speakers and voice-based operating systems and its move to acquire iRobot should bolster its position in the consumer devices category and augment broader strategic initiatives. Between its various products and services for consumers and businesses Amazon has access to an incredible amount of data and this should help the company take advantage of opportunities in artificial intelligence and continue mapping out new growth strategies and ways to capitalize on synergies between its businesses.

Amazon's cloud segment is highly profitable and continues to grow at an impressive clip and advancements in automation and robotics could ultimately make its market-leading e-commerce business much more profitable. With big opportunities in its two core businesses growth potential in other categories and a penchant for market-defining innovation Amazon looks like a great buy today.

The case for Alphabet

Parkev Tatevosian: The factors that help make Alphabet an excellent stock to buy are that it holds a dominant position in a massive industry and sells at a relatively inexpensive valuation. Indeed Alphabet is home to Google the most powerful search engine worldwide. That's a critically important business to dominate because so many purchase decisions start with an internet search.

It can partly explain how Alphabet has expanded its revenue from $46 billion in 2012 to $258 billion in 2021. More importantly it helped boost operating income from $13.8 billion to $78.7 billion in that same time. Businesses with less dominant positions frequently grapple with competitors which works toward lower profits. Alphabet's search engine makes money through advertising. Companies pay Alphabet to have their websites listed near the top of search engine queries.

It's estimated that advertisers will spend $838 billion globally in 2022 an 8.4% increase from the year before. That massive figure allowed Alphabet to expand beyond its $258 billion revenue in 2021. If it operated in a smaller market it could approach a ceiling much faster making an investment less lucrative.

Despite these excellent prospects Alphabet is trading relatively inexpensively at a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 25.6 and a price-to-earnings ratio of 22.8. These are below its historical averages through the last five years.

Which big tech stock should you buy today?

Unless you're only interested in owning one of these big tech companies in your portfolio this is a case where buying both stocks could be the right move. Alphabet's top positions in search digital advertising and mobile give it clear avenues to long-term expansion. Meanwhile Amazon's market-leading e-commerce and cloud computing businesses give it a strong growth engine and the company has proven it can successfully branch into new categories. Both of these technology leaders look poised to tap into secular growth trends and each stock stands a good chance of being a long-term winner."

News 5 spoke with John Davis who said he was delivering a package across the street when he first smelled smoke and turned around and saw it coming from the basement of a nearby apartment building.

Davis said when he approached some of the residents who were already outside they told him there were still at least two people still inside.

‚ÄúI jumped out ran toward the door and there was a young boy hanging out the window‚Äù Davis explained. ‚ÄúHim and his father were in there so I went inside the doorway I couldn‚Äôt see anything so I crawled and started yelling telling them to come toward me.‚Äù

Davis said he grabbed the boy first and brought him outside and then immediately grabbed his father and took him outside as well.

News 5 spoke with one of the individuals pulled from the building who emigrated from Nepal and had been living in the building for the past six years.

Despite a language barrier the man thanked the Amazon driver for helping him safely get out of the building.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad the gentleman and his son got out and I was there to help them‚Äù Davis said.

A spokesperson with the Red Cross told News 5 they assisted 26 people in eight impacted apartments.

Battalion Chief Dan Candow with Cleveland Heights Fire Department told News 5 there was heavy smoke on the back of the building when they arrived. He added it‚Äôs not clear at this time what started the fire but it is clear the role Davis played in all this.

‚ÄúJohn Davis is a hero‚Äù Candow said.

As a result according to Candow no injuries were reported and no one was transported to a hospital.

A sigh of relief for Davis but no time to unwind after this ordeal.

‚ÄúI still have packages to deliver‚Äù he chuckled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF0bGFudGljLmNvbS9pZGVhcy9hcmNoaXZlLzIwMjIvMDgvYW1hem9uLXJvb21iYS1pcm9ib3QtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tbW9ub3BvbHkvNjcxMTQ1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon‚Äôs Acquisition of the Roomba Is Dangerous,"Earlier this month Amazon announced that it was buying the Roomba vacuum maker iRobot. On the surface this move looks like a massive online retail marketplace acquiring a popular gadget to sell to its loyal shoppers. Roomba is a sparkling consumer product and iRobot has sold 40 million of them over the past two decades. Shoppers today find them occupying end caps at big retailers such as Costco and Target. The device‚Äôs smooth spinning design has given it a huge chunk of the $3 billion-a-year robot-vacuum market; three quarters of all smart vacuums sold in America bear the Roomba name. In that way the deal makes sense.

But my suspicion is that for Amazon the deal has nothing to do with cleaning your floors. What it seems to be about‚Äîexpanding the company‚Äôs reach further into people‚Äôs lives‚Äîshould trouble everyone.

Amazon‚Äôs monopoly power looks like this: Sales on Amazon account for at least half of all online commerce in the U.S. Three out of every four product searches begin on the site. Amazon‚Äôs shipping and warehousing service delivers about a quarter of all e-commerce packages in America and is on pace to overtake UPS as the second-largest consumer package-delivery company after the U.S. Postal Service. Amazon Web Services is by far the largest cloud-computing company in the country. Amazon Echo accounts for two-thirds of all smart speakers. This is by no means a complete accounting.

The iRobot deal follows a known Amazon strategy one that Jeff Bezos has admitted to in the past: using mergers to buy its way to dominance. (I asked Amazon if this is what it‚Äôs doing with Roomba but the company did not comment.) Several companies make and sell robotic vacuums including brands like Shark and others. But Roomba is the household name so ubiquitous that it‚Äôs shorthand for every other robot vacuum available. By simply taking over the company that makes the most popular product in the industry Amazon can grow its monopoly without actually having to out-innovate and out-compete its rivals.

David Dayen: America‚Äôs monopoly problem goes way beyond the tech giants

Amazon can then use its gatekeeper power by pairing Roomba with its monopoly online marketplace and Prime subscription program leaving other vacuum brands to wither and atrophy unable to gain the attention and prominence held by Roomba on the country‚Äôs most popular shopping site.

Amazon has used a range of anti-competitive tactics to secure a commanding position across a variety of home-tech products all designed to further its dominance of the smart home. The company often sells its Echo smart speakers at a loss mirroring the predatory pricing strategy it used to sell diapers its Kindle and even its Prime Video service in order to drive out rivals and expand its primacy. Amazon might very well employ the same strategy with Roomba. Combine its monopoly retail power with below-cost pricing and the deal becomes a competition killer.

This merger isn‚Äôt just about controlling the robot-vacuum industry or even about smart-home devices. Owning Roomba would give the world‚Äôs most dominant spy-tech maker yet another portal into our homes and lives. It could map where we live what we own and what it should be selling to its hundreds of millions of captured customers.

Amazon got its towering place in home tech the same way it is expanding it now‚Äîby buying other companies. It bought the voice-assistant start-up Evi Technologies in 2013 to help create what would eventually become Alexa the voice of Echo and by far the leading smart-speaker voice assistant. Then to extend its eyes and ears into people‚Äôs homes Amazon bought two start-ups: the camera maker Blink in 2017 and a doorbell company called Ring in 2018. Today Ring accounts for an estimated 40 percent of all video doorbells installed in America.

These devices have given Amazon incredible access to people‚Äôs daily lives. The company has a documented history of leveraging the data its vast home-tech network captures in order to grow‚Äîand to expand its monopoly power. For example Amazon has for years used Alexa‚Äôs algorithm to steer customers toward Amazon‚Äôs own products. Ring monitors and records every interaction with a customer's doorbell including every doorbell buzz and every movement in proximity to the outside of the door and congressional investigators found that ‚Äúacquiring Ring and Blink was in part to expand and reinforce [Amazon‚Äôs] market power for its other business lines.‚Äù

Amazon‚Äôs quest for consumer data comes with deep and real concerns about the way the company uses the images and sounds its home-tech products capture. It has partnered with police departments across America to get its Ring doorbell installed in neighborhoods where it is used to surveil communities unknowingly and without consent. Amazon then shares the video footage its doorbells capture with police without a warrant or permission. Its Echo speakers have captured private conversations and shared those with Amazon without the permission of the eavesdropped. (On its website Amazon says ‚ÄúOn some occasions Alexa may accidentally wake up when the wake word wasn‚Äôt spoken but your Echo device thought it was‚Äù and that the company is ‚Äúconstantly improving our wake word detection technology.‚Äù)

Read: How to fight Amazon (before you turn 29)

The latest Roomba models capture information that Amazon at the moment doesn‚Äôt have access to. iRobot‚Äôs new operating system maps the floor plan and contents of the spaces in which it operates. The vacuums are now equipped with a camera so it can respond to commands like ‚ÄúClean in front of the couch.‚Äù But that means it knows what kind of couch you have‚Äîand crib and dog bed and so on. If the deal goes through Amazon will too whether or not you wanted Amazon to know that stuff. (Amazon did not comment on how it would use data collected by Roombas.)

If this deal feels bad and intrusive that‚Äôs because it is. People buy a Roomba because they want something that will clean their floors. Most folks don‚Äôt want a spinning camera-equipped data vacuum taking stock of their home and its contents then beaming that information back to the most powerful retail monopoly on Earth.

And Amazon‚Äôs data sweeps are more than creepy; they‚Äôre a roadblock to other companies that might want to jump into the smart-home market. Through its acquisition of Whole Foods its attempted purchase of One Medical and other deals Amazon is positioned to crush new rivals. Every piece of information Amazon collects about people‚Äôs lives‚Äîwhat they most want to buy what questions they most commonly ask what they keep inside their homes‚Äîraises the barrier to fair competition even higher.

Regulators will look at this deal closely as they should. The direction of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is changing under the leadership of Lina Khan a critic of monopoly power and Amazon specifically. If the agency sees this deal as I do Amazon may have to leave the floor-cleaning to someone else.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDIyL2EtZGVlcGVyLXVuZGVyc3RhbmRpbmctb2YtYW1hem9uLXNlY3JldHMtb2YtdGhlLWNvbXBhbnlzLXN1Y2Nlc3MtYW5kLXdoZXJlLWl0cy1oZWFkZWQtbmV4dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Understanding Amazon: Secrets of the company's success and where it's headed next,"An Amazon promotion for the film ‚ÄúJurassic World‚Äù with a hashtag that could double as the company‚Äôs mantra.

Amazon is one of the most extraordinary business stories of our time. Many people in the tech industry have a general understanding of this story picking up bits and pieces of its lore and culture over the years.

But what are the real reasons for Amazon‚Äôs success? What can today‚Äôs entrepreneurs learn from what Jeff Bezos did? And where is Amazon headed next?

Two startup investors spent about two months researching Amazon in their spare time to answer questions like those and they just shared what they learned.

Ben Gilbert managing director at Seattle-based Pioneer Square Labs and David Rosenthal a San Francisco-based angel investor this week released an epic episode of their podcast Acquired spanning nearly 4-and-a-half hours ‚Äî providing a deeper understanding of Amazon and new insights into the company.

Gilbert joins my colleague John Cook and me on this week‚Äôs episode of the GeekWire Podcast to discuss key takeaways and highlights from their Amazon deep dive.

Listen below and continue reading for notes from the conversation.

Why was it important to do this deep dive on Amazon?

Amazon has been mentioned frequently on Acquired but Ben and David felt that they hadn‚Äôt done the company justice as a subject unto itself.

They came to realize that many people in the Bay Area for example might know about door-desks or two-pizza teams but don‚Äôt understand the intricacies of the company.

It‚Äôs a very interesting time at Amazon but the main reason was that this company is still misunderstood.

Key insight from Ben on the Acquired episode: Amazon philosophically is a straight line strategically a squiggly line and tactically a random set of dots powered by a fact-finding algorithm.

This explains why the company persists despite failures such as its multiple attempts at the third-party retail business before coming up with the successful Amazon Marketplace.

The philosophical straight line is customer obsession. Jeff Bezos posits that in the extreme long-run there is perfect alignment between customer and shareholder interests.

How do you turn customer obsession into a product roadmap? You can‚Äôt. And so you need to squiggle your way to it zooming around the maze hitting a wall backing up and trying again.

Related to this is Amazon‚Äôs distinction between one- and two-way doors: distinguishing between decisions that are irreversible and those that aren‚Äôt and treating decisions differently depending on that determination.

Biggest surprise from the research?

Bezos was initially inspired by a report showing that web traffic in 1993 had grown by a factor of 2300 or 230000 percent as detailed by Brad Stone in his book The Everything Store.

As a business opportunity it‚Äôs difficult or impossible to identify anything that compares to that kind of growth today and much of the biggest growth areas are the result of the internet.

A good question for entrepreneurs: would they recognize and act on opportunities like this?

Todd suggests quantum computing or fusion energy as the next one. John jokes that it‚Äôs the metaverse.

Pivotal early meeting between Amazon and eBay showed the difference.

Meg Whitman then CEO of eBay preferred the higher profit margins of a capital-light pure digital business.

Bezos believed in building out the infrastructure for distribution and order fulfillment ‚Äî costlier short-term but more valuable long term.

Ben: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how many people are spending too high of a percent of their paycheck on eBay these days. But there‚Äôs a lot more on Amazon.‚Äù

Amazon‚Äôs impact on the Seattle startup ecosystem.

Ben on Acquired: ‚ÄúThe biggest impediment for the Seattle startup ecosystem was the fact that Amazon facilitated entrepreneurship over and over again for people of all stages of their career with all levels of ambition.‚Äù

John agrees: What‚Äôs amazing about Amazon is their ability is their ability to stay innovative and entrepreneurial even as they‚Äôve grown to more than a million employees allowing them to retain and recruit entrepreneurial people who otherwise might have created their own startups.

Is it really still ‚ÄúDay One‚Äù at Amazon?

This is Bezos‚Äô oft-quoted mantra meant to illustrate the growth potential ahead. In 2000 Bezos wrote ‚ÄúWe still believe that some 15% of retail commerce may ultimately move online.‚Äù

Retail sales exceeded that threshold in the pandemic declining somewhat since the peak. Based on this Ben says ‚ÄúI think it is Day Two for Amazon.‚Äù

Ben: ‚ÄúWhere do people think that ecommerce penetration will land as a percentage of total commerce? We‚Äôre there. And to be honest other than maybe a house and a car I don‚Äôt know how I could spend more money on the internet ‚Ä¶ most of it on Amazon.‚Äù

Shift to a new CEO Andy Jassy is also a sign of this.

However Ben says it‚Äôs important to note: ‚ÄúDay Two‚Äù does not mean Amazon is no longer innovative. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs Day Two because they‚Äôre open to the idea of making money and reaping some of the value from everything that they‚Äôve created out in the world.‚Äù Investors expect them to do this at some point.

What‚Äôs the best acquisition Amazon has made?

Ben cites Amazon‚Äôs $300 million acquisition of Audible in 2008.

Today Audible has 40% of the $5 billion audiobook market projected to reach $35 billion by 2030.

Plus for Amazon it‚Äôs not just a financial asset but ‚Äúincredibly intertwined‚Äù with its core business.

Recent deals to acquire One Medical and iRobot are part of Amazon‚Äôs search for a fourth pillar of its business.

The original Amazon HQ in a rented home in Bellevue Wash. shows innovation can come from anywhere. Here‚Äôs our story on the 2019 sale of that home and the significance of the oversized mailbox that was once on the curb.

What should entrepreneurs study learn and adopt from Bezos or Amazon that they wouldn‚Äôt do naturally?

True customer obsession. Not just lip service. Genuine devotion to serving customers. Bezos put ‚Äúevery single ounce of attention and energy‚Äù into this.

This is not a natural thing for many startups to do despite what they may say.

Ben: ‚ÄúThe only way to birth Amazon into the world and to then continue to innovate the way they did for 20-plus years is to perform unnatural acts over and over and over again.‚Äù

Talib's decision to step away from his analyst role for ""Thursday Night Football"" comes in the wake of his brother Yaqub Talib turning himself in at the Dallas County (Texas) Jail when a warrant was issued for his arrest after he allegedly shot and killed a man at a youth football game on Aug. 13. Yaqub Talib was charged with felony first-degree murder.

According to The Lancaster Police Department the shooting occurred at Lancaster Community Park after a disagreement between coaching staffs over a call turned physical. The suspect pulled out a gun and shot 43-year-old Michael Hickmon multiple times. Hickmon a coach for one of the teams (the D.E.A. Dragons) and a former college football standout at North Texas was transferred to a local hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

According to WFAA both Yaqub and Aqib Talib were coaches of the North Dallas United Bobcats the other team playing at the time of the incident. Aqib Talib was not mentioned in the Lancaster Police press release.

Aqib Talib was set to join Amazon's ""Thursday Night Football"" team as an analyst alongside the likes of Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez Richard Sherman and the newly-retired Ryan Fitzpatrick. Talib had recently done color commentary work for Fox.

An all-Black female crew operated an American Airlines flight from Dallas to Phoenix in honor of Bessie Coleman the first Black woman to earn a pilot‚Äôs license in 1921.

The airline hosted the Bessie Coleman Aviation All-Stars tour this week to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Coleman performing the first public flight by an African American woman in 1922.

‚ÄúShe bravely broke down barriers within the world of aviation and paved the path for many to follow‚Äù American Airlines said in a statement.

Coleman‚Äôs great-niece Gigi Coleman was hosted on the flight operated by the all-Black female crew of pilots flight attendants customer service coordinators cargo team members and the aviation maintenance technician the airline said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for American Airlines to give us this opportunity to highlight my great aunt‚Äôs accomplishments in the field of aviation‚Äù Gigi said in a video posted by American Airlines titled ‚ÄúEmpowering Women in the Skies.‚Äù

Very few American women of any race had pilot‚Äôs licenses by 1918 but those who did were often White and rich. Undeterred Coleman learned French and moved to Paris and was accepted by the Caudron Brothers School of Aviation. In 1921 Coleman became the first female pilot of African American and Native American descent.

Coleman died at 34 in 1926 during a practice run with another pilot. While she never fulfilled her dream to open a flight school for future Black pilots Coleman‚Äôs imprint on aviation history lives on CNN previously reported.

Black women have been ‚Äúnotably underrepresented in the aviation industry especially as pilots representing less than 1% in the commercial airline industry‚Äù American Airlines said.

‚ÄúToday I‚Äôm beyond thrilled to be a part of the crew where we are inspiring young girls young girls of color to see the various roles that these women play in every aspect to make this flight possible‚Äù Captain Beth Powell the flight‚Äôs pilot said in the video.

American Airlines said it is committed to diversifying the flight deck which includes ‚Äúexpanding awareness of and increasing accessibility to the pilot career within diverse communities‚Äù through its cadet academy.

The day after the historic flight representatives from the Bessie Coleman Foundation and American Airlines pilots and cadets met with students at the Academies at South Mountain in Phoenix where the flight landed to expose young people to careers in the aviation industry.

‚ÄúI knew she was the first African American woman to get her pilot‚Äôs license she was the first to do it so she inspired the next generation to follow her footsteps and know that they can also be what they want to be‚Äù said Mohamed Mohamed an aspiring airline pilot who studies aerospace at the academy in the video.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWV0aGluay5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9zdXBlcnNvbmljLXBsYW5lc9IBO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWV0aGluay5jb20vaGFyZC10ZWNoL3N1cGVyc29uaWMtcGxhbmVzP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines plans to buy 20 supersonic planes,"American Airlines has agreed to purchase 20 supersonic planes from Denver-based Boom Supersonic ‚Äî if the startup can get the ultrafast jets off the ground and approved by regulators.

Why it matters: Supersonic planes by definition travel faster than the speed of sound ‚Äî 767 miles per hour ‚Äî but Boom‚Äôs in-development Overture jet is expected to travel much faster than that with a cruising speed of ‚Äã‚Äã1227 mph.

That‚Äôs about twice as fast as any existing commercial airplane so it would dramatically cut flight times ‚Äî at that speed a trip from Miami to London would take less than 5 hours compared to today‚Äôs 9.5.

The last supersonic passenger jet ‚Äî the Concorde ‚Äî was expensive and fuel-hungry.

The challenge: The Boom Overture wouldn‚Äôt be the first supersonic passenger plane. European airlines British Airways and Air France operated the Concorde between 1976 and 2003.

While the jet did cut flight times the FAA and other regulators preemptively banned supersonic planes over land to avoid noisy sonic ‚Äúbooms‚Äù which dramatically limited its potential routes.

The Concorde also burned a lot of expensive fuel which led to sky-high ticket prices ‚Äî a trip from New York to London could cost upwards of $15000. The plane was ultimately retired for being unprofitable.

Tomorrow‚Äôs supersonic planes: Boom believes the Overture will overcome the Concorde‚Äôs shortcomings.

Boom designed the plane with fuel-efficiency in mind ‚Äî its body is made from a light carbon composite material and its gull wings and specially shaped fuselage are designed to reduce drag.

Between its cleaner fuel and planned carbon offsets Boom expects the Overture to be the first fully carbon neutral aircraft.

That should help keep ticket prices way below what Concorde passengers paid ‚Äî ‚Äã‚ÄãBoom CEO Blake Scholl expects a ticket from NYC to London to cost between $4000 to $5000 on an Overture which will seat 65 to 80 passengers.

Instead of using traditional jet fuel Boom‚Äôs supersonic planes will also be designed to run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel which is made from organic matter. Between the cleaner fuel and planned carbon offsets Boom expects the Overture to be the first fully carbon neutral aircraft.

Looking ahead: Like the Concorde the Boom Overture will still be banned from traveling over land. However with a range of 4250 nautical miles Boom says more than 600 routes are still in play ‚Äî but first it needs to fly the plane.

The final production design of the jet is expected to be ready in 2025 with a first flight scheduled for 2026. If everything goes well with flight tests and certification Boom hopes to have its supersonic planes ready to carry passengers in 2029.

The airline industry seems optimistic that Boom will be able to deliver on its promise too ‚Äî the company has preorders for 130 Overtures including 15 for United Airlines and the 20 that American Airlines has now ordered and paid a non-refundable deposit for.

Anne Cornell of the Pomerene Center for the Arts is a visiting artist at Conesville for the program. She's been at Conesville three years and was at Keene the two years before that.

The program doesn't replace arts in the building but is a compliment to curriculum as art elements are incorporated into regular lessons.

This year's arts program will have the theme of migration tying into Conesville closing and students and staff moving to new building for the 2023 to 2024 school year.

CONESVILLE ‚àí Migrations will be the theme of a special arts program this school year at Conesville Elementary School as students and staff prepare to move into new buildings in the 2023 to 2024 school year.

The school received a $30000 TeachArtsOhio grant from the Ohio Arts Council to fund arts programming. River View Local Schools has been without an elementary arts program for several years due to budget cuts. However administration and teachers have looked for ways to incorporate art into their curriculum.

Anne Cornell Executive Director for the Pomerene Center for the Arts first started working with students at Keene Elementary School in 2018. She was there for two years and has been at Conesville the past three years. Cornell as a visiting artist collaborates with teachers on ideas for projects.

""It's very difficult to serve very many people especially children from a small institution doing art and reaching a broad base of kids"" Cornell said of working only through the Pomerene Center. ""It's so exciting to be able to reach and impact hopefully a large number of kids and that's done effectively through the schools.""

She said the program has grown from doing a few small art projects in the classroom to a large year-long piece with a few side projects and some other artists coming in. An outdoor reading room was created last year with the creation of chairs and displays.

Banners called Franken-Readers were pieced together from drawings students did of children reading. One picture might have a book from one picture a foot from another eyes from another and so on. Each grade level has its own Franken-Reader banner. A white hallway in the lower part of the Conesville building features a Dot Obliteration with students placing different sized and colored dots on the walls.

Principal Jarred Renner wouldn't call it a substitute for their arts program but an artistic component to coincide with lessons. For example a side art project last year was choreographing an interpretive dance demonstrating the different stages of the water cycle part of third grade science.

""This isn't a replacement for kids going and learning how to do the different medias of art but this comes in and goes alongside the curriculum they're already learning"" Renner said.

Tom Dugdale Assistant Professor in the Department of Theatre Film and Media Arts at Ohio State University met with students at the end of last school year and spoke with them on the closure of the American Electric Power plant just outside the village. Their comments were used in a storytelling project. Dugdale and Cornell are also working on a theatrical presentation on the closure of the plant and how it impacted the local area which student stories will be incorporated into as well.

Due to budget cuts from the loss of $2.2 million in tax revenue from the closure of the plant River View will be reconfiguring in the 2023 to 2024 school year. Conesville and Keene will be closed with Warsaw Elementary serving as a preschool to second grade building. Third to sixth grades will be at the junior high building with Renner as principal and seventh to twelfth grades will be at the high school.

Due to the transition migration will be a primary theme this school year at Conesville. This includes looking at migrations in world and U.S. history and in nature with birds and other animals. Renner said staff and students have fears about what's to come and he feels this theme is a constructive way to address them a way to make the transition calm. Exact art projects are to be finalized but will tie into the migration theme.

""We're looking at all these different ways people and animals migrate and how it's not always a bad thing. Most of the time it's for a reason. We're doing it to progress or gain an advantage"" Renner said. ""Often with migration there is that unknown factor that causes anxiety but it's not always a bad thing. Good things can come from it.""

Production in the long narrow New Flyer Industries plant is moving like clockwork as employees transform piles of steel frame parts into massive colourful transit bus shells for cities all across Canada and the United States. It starts in the weld shop where it takes about 20000 welds to transform slabs of steel into massive bus frames. A long track runs the length of the factory floor allowing one frame at a time to be carted through a series of workstations where employees apply corrosion protection fit fibreglass panels caulk joints install electrical parts paint and attach finishing touches like windows and lights. At the end of the line finished bus shells are lifted ‚Äî without doors wheels batteries or engines ‚Äî onto flatbed trailers and trucked out to a facility in Minnesota for the final assembly.

Many of the buses will later be fitted with battery-powered propulsion systems helping fill a growing share of orders for new zero-emission transit technology. With nearly 100 years of history in the bus-making industry electric buses are now what New Flyer does best.

But over the pandemic New Flyer has struggled losing millions of dollars and shedding hundreds of jobs. The company has also temporarily shut down operations at times due to supply chain disruptions ‚Äî including a temporary factory shut down this month ‚Äî and is delivering far fewer buses than it did in years past. In addition American legislation has hampered the company‚Äôs ability to set up full-scale production facilities at home in Canada and like the buses themselves many of the company‚Äôs green jobs have been sent south of the border.

With Canada making major investments to speed up electric transit adoption from coast to coast the opportunity for a made-in-Canada green transit industry looks bright. But the company is unsure Canada‚Äôs workforce will be able to keep up.

This uncertainty highlights how the Trudeau government has failed to introduce a plan to protect clean tech jobs for bus manufacturing in Canada even as it seeks to tackle carbon pollution from the transportation industry ‚Äî which is responsible for almost a quarter of the country‚Äôs annual greenhouse gas emissions.

Industry experts warn the federal government will need to focus efforts on developing strong policy incentives to build and retain a robust electric transit workforce ‚Äî or risk shuttling its transit investments outside its borders.

Leading the electric bus revolution from Manitoba

Long before New Flyer began making a name for itself as the go-to shop for electric buses a Winnipeg man named Jon Coval founded Western Auto and Truck Body Works Ltd. With a team of five staff Coval built truck and bus shells in the early 1930s selling their first full bus builds to Grey Goose Bus Lines in 1937. By the 1940s Western Auto had designed the Western Flyer ‚Äî a coach-style bus set to take over inter-city transportation in Western Canada. The Western Flyer quickly became the company‚Äôs star offering prompting the company to change its name to Western Flyer Coach. The company hit bumpy financial roads through the 1950s and ‚Äô60s prompting the provincial government to step in and take over operations under the name Flyer Industries Ltd. in 1971. During those early decades the company tried its hand at transit buses and trolleys slowly building a customer base across Canada and the United States.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Manitoba success story‚Äù Stephen King New Flyer‚Äôs vice president of strategy and investor relations tells The Narwhal and the Free Press in an interview. ‚ÄúWinnipeg is at the centre of the country and really closely located to the United States. Solid manufacturing history rail-line access and all those types of things made it an attractive place to start the business.‚Äù

In 1986 the company‚Äôs vision changed. Jan Den Oudsten a descendant of coachbuilders from the Netherlands bought the company and ushered in an era of technological innovation. Under the name New Flyer Den Oudsten‚Äôs vision saw the company develop a host of ‚Äòfirsts‚Äô in North American public transit. There was the first low-floor bus already a hit in Europe which eliminated the need for stairs at the bus entrance then the first low-floor articulated bus which could seat extra passengers thanks to a flexible extender in the middle of the bus. In the 1990s New Flyer took bus technology to new heights as it worked to develop the world‚Äôs first hydrogen fuel cell powered buses and in 1998 the company delivered the first ever diesel-electric hybrid bus making an indelible mark on the future of public transit.

‚ÄúI think we saw the writing on the wall that the future was going to be electric‚Äù King says.

New Flyer Industries went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange as NFI Group in 2005 and in the years since has collected a host of accolades as a North American leader in zero-emission bus technology. They supplied the first fleet of hydrogen fuel cell electric buses to B.C. transit for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics; they unveiled the first all-electric bus prototype in 2012 with orders secured for Chicago‚Äôs transit fleet the same year; and announced both a zero-emission Xcelsior model and plans to develop the first North American-built 60-foot fuel cell bus in 2014. Along the way they‚Äôve acquired a host of competitors and parts manufacturers established international offices and developed a wing specifically aimed at helping cities plan the infrastructure needed to implement electric-transit technologies.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd call us the ‚ÄòTesla‚Äô of buses‚Äù King laughs reflecting on the company‚Äôs history in the industry. ‚ÄúBut our view is that we are the leader of electrification in the transit space.‚Äù

Today New Flyer Industries offers what King estimates is the widest range of transit buses in North America. The company is ‚Äúpropulsion-agnostic‚Äù he explains selling everything from old-school diesel buses to hybrids to battery and hydrogen fuel cell-powered buses.

The ‚Äúsecret sauce‚Äù King says is that the company is able to customize each bus to its customers needs ‚Äî from engine to paint colours ‚Äî bringing a host of technologies together in one machine.

‚ÄúWe call ourselves ‚Äòmobility solutions providers‚Äô ‚Äù King says. On top of bus manufacturing the company makes several of its own parts and offers maintenance training and service for its buses.

‚ÄúIf you need anything bus-related outside of operating the vehicles we do everything else.‚Äù

The now-international NFI Group employs more than 7500 people at dozens of facilities across the globe. About 2500 staff members are employed at the company‚Äôs ‚Äúflagship‚Äù facility ‚Äî the global headquarters in Winnipeg. King says about half of those employees work in bus production and manufacturing while the other half help steer the corporation.

Despite touting itself as a leader in Canada‚Äôs zero-emission bus market New Flyer only gets a fraction of its business from Canadian transit agencies. About 90 percent of the company‚Äôs business is driven by customers in the United States.

A Canadian zero-emission legacy an American market

Since 2020 the company has been reporting significant declines in revenue deliveries and profits owing largely to supply chain disruptions the company says and this quarter was no exception. Revenue reportedly dropped 32 per cent compared to 2021 bus deliveries were down 43 per cent and the company reported net losses of US$57 million ‚Äî but the executive team said it remains optimistic.

Paul Soubry president and CEO of NFI Group told analysts on a quarterly results call in early August ‚Äúthere have been some positive signs that the worst is now over‚Äù citing ‚Äúrecord demand‚Äù and a backlog of bus orders that would help fill the company‚Äôs coffers in the coming quarters. Most of that demand Soubry highlighted is for zero-emission buses which make up a growing percentage of current orders and backlog as well as more than 50 per cent of the company‚Äôs potential bids for the next five years. In the second quarter zero-emission buses made up 11 per cent of the more than 500 units the company delivered. Articulated buses ‚Äî longer models connected by a central accordion piece ‚Äî are counted as two units.

Some of New Flyer‚Äôs competitors also appear to be announcing a flurry of new deals.

In June NOVA bus a Quebec manufacturer owned by Volvo announced separate deals to supply electric and clean diesel buses to transit agencies in Halifax and Huntsville Alabama. Quebec-based Lion Electric which has cornered the market for electric school buses in Canada reported a 72 per cent uptick in bus deliveries compared to 2021 and a subsequent 76 per cent bump in revenue in its second quarter results.

In Canada and the United States Soubry said the ‚Äúprimary driver‚Äù of bus orders is government funding. Though funding programs for transit buses vary widely from market to market the United States leads with ‚Äúwell-established federal funding programs for transit fleet replacements‚Äù according to NFI Group‚Äôs annual filings. In the U.S. federal funds typically cover about 80 per cent of the bus costs while the remaining 20 per cent come from local funding.

Since 2016 New Flyer has benefited from a dedicated funding program for low or zero-emission transit in the United States. The Low-No grant program as it‚Äôs called offers competitive grants to transit agencies to support a transition to clean tech. In June 2020 New Flyer was named a ‚Äúpartner of choice‚Äù by 12 major U.S. transit agencies giving them preference for projects awarded under the grant program. Nine transit agencies named New Flyer as a partner of choice again in 2021 and that year the company received over US$40 million in Low-No grants. In 2022 the U.S. government made more than US$1.6 billion available to transit agencies through the Low-No program and New Flyer expects to continue benefitting from the fund as projects are announced in the coming weeks.

NFI Group is quick to point out that zero-emission buses ‚Äî which cost twice as much as diesel buses ‚Äî bring in better profit margins for the company.

As a result the company‚Äôs business has been focused south of the border. Of its 25 North American facilities just a handful are sprinkled throughout Manitoba and Ontario. Outside of the Winnipeg headquarters most manufacturing takes place at facilities in Minnesota and Alabama. Even the company‚Äôs ‚ÄúVehicle Innovation Centre‚Äù where customers can get a feel for the company‚Äôs offerings is located at New Flyer‚Äôs Alabama plant.

In Canada by contrast NFI Group notes there has historically not been a dedicated source of funding for transit buses. Instead funding typically came from ‚Äúa patchwork of provincial funding municipal funding fare box revenue various federal programs and other smaller sources‚Äù meaning funding levels could vary widely from province to province and even city to city. Until recently zero-emission bus adoption in Canada has moved at a trickle with cities hesitant to invest in big-ticket purchases without federal funds.

But there‚Äôs good news. In February 2021 the Canadian government announced a $14.9 billion-investment in public transit with $2.75 billion set aside for zero-emission transit and school bus planning and procurement. That zero-emission transit fund paired with a direct loan financing program through the Canadian Infrastructure Bank has both New Flyer and industry experts feeling hopeful for Canada‚Äôs future.

‚ÄúThe Canadian market actually has quite an encouraging outlook over the next little while in terms of the fleet rejuvenation in Canada with a serious commitment by the federal government on helping the provinces in the cities to make that happen‚Äù Soubry said during the quarterly results meeting.

King says the ‚Äúreally big steps‚Äù the Canadian government has taken over the last couple years are expected to drive ‚Äúbig orders and big demand‚Äù in the Canadian market ‚Äî and that demand is already underway. In April New Flyer inked a contract with the Toronto Transit Commission to provide more than 200 hybrid-electric buses in the next four years with the option to produce another 360 buses in the years to come.

It‚Äôs NFI Group‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst major win in that market in over a decade‚Äù Brian Dewsnup president of subsidiary NFI Parts said during the quarterly results call. And the company hopes that‚Äôs just the beginning.

Consortium: ‚ÄòKill cars‚Äô and ‚Äòput steroids‚Äô into transit

The federal government has set an ambitious target of 5000 zero-emission buses running on Canadian streets by 2026 as part of a plan to address greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. Since the transportation sector produced 24 per cent of the country‚Äôs annual emissions in 2020 the federal government has noted zero-emission vehicles can help the country meet its international commitments under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. But as of now there are just 208 electric buses on the road most of which hit the streets in the last 16 months and are concentrated in larger urban centres like Toronto Edmonton Montreal and Vancouver says Josipa Petrunic president of the Canadian Urban Transit Research and Innovation Consortium (CUTRIC).

‚ÄúMy only job is really to get rid of cars by making transit faster sexier cooler greener cheaper‚Äù Petrunic says in an interview.

Since 2015 the consortium has been operating as a technology innovation non-profit offering demonstrations market research and other project support for the transit industry across Canada. Over the last seven years the consortium has spent significant time lobbying the federal government to financially support the research and development needed to bring electric buses online.

‚ÄúThere is no doubt that if we want to get to our climate action goals for Paris we‚Äôre going to have to kill cars and really ramp up and put steroids into the transit industry‚Äù Petrunic says.

So far a handful of mid-to-large cities have pledged to bring electric vehicles into their fleet by 2026 but those promises only represent about 2000 buses in total Petrunic says. Since procuring an electric bus can take about three years from order to delivery Petrunic estimates it will take until 2030 to meet the national target of 5000 at the current pace.

There are two major hurdles between cities and electric transit fleets: infrastructure and cost. While a standard diesel bus can be bought for about $600000 a battery-electric bus costs around $1.1 million and hydrogen fuel cell bus can run upwards of $1.4 million ‚Äî and that‚Äôs not counting the cost of charging infrastructure.

Transit agencies need one charger for every 12 buses and those chargers can easily cost $1 million each Petrunic explains. For a fleet like Toronto‚Äôs which boasts more than 2000 buses that means hundreds of chargers and hundreds of millions of dollars on top of the price of the bus. Those chargers also need to be housed in new garages that can accommodate the buses‚Äô new tech adding significantly to the cost of adoption.

But these buses also contain a fuel cell stack and hydrogen tank and can run a bit longer before needing a fuel top up. This method can help reduce the cost of charging infrastructure but green hydrogen is in short supply in Canada.

But Canada‚Äôs new funding package has eased some of the financial burden prompting cities to beef up their fleet-replacement promises. Marco D‚ÄôAngelo president of the Canadian Urban Transit Association says cities like Ottawa Toronto Vancouver Edmonton and even Winnipeg have started to lead the charge toward fully-electric fleets.

Winnipeg has promised to have about 15 per cent of its fleet electric by 2027; Edmonton already operates 40 electric buses with 20 more expected this year; Toronto which already has dozens of electric buses on the road plans to be fully electric by 2040; Ottawa has promised a zero-emission fleet by 2036; Vancouver which already operates a robust trolley bus system plans to be fully electric as soon as it can D‚ÄôAngelo explains.

The boon in demand for electric vehicles is good news for Canadian companies invested in zero-emission bus manufacturing. New Flyer and its competitors including Volvo-owned Nova Bus and school bus maker Lion Electric both headquartered in Quebec have started to see an opportunity to ramp up production in the local market.

But there‚Äôs a hitch one that could see Canadian taxpayers supporting green jobs south of the border instead of closer to home: the Buy America rules.

Manitoba factory lost hundreds of jobs says Unifor

Once upon a time buses built at the Winnipeg facility could drive right out of the plant ‚Äî in fact NFI Group still makes a handful of coach-style buses entirely in Winnipeg ‚Äî but the growing pressure of American content regulations have put a stop to the company‚Äôs all-Canadian transit manufacturing.

Since 1982 the United States has required publicly funded transportation infrastructure like highways bridges and public transit must be made in America with American materials. Over the years details of this ‚ÄòBuy America‚Äô legislation have changed but the end result has handcuffed Canada‚Äôs transit manufacturing industry. Right now Buy America rules for transit mandate that any project receiving more than $150000 in federal funding must contain at least 70 per cent American-made parts (calculated by cost) and complete final assembly in the United States.

Those rules have had a major impact on New Flyer‚Äôs operations says Clint Seys president of Unifor local 3003 the union representing New Flyer‚Äôs Winnipeg employees.

Seys who‚Äôs been at the plant for nearly 30 years says his union once represented more than 1600 Winnipeg employees but the 2008 financial crisis set off a chain reaction that saw U.S. content rules get more stringent and the Winnipeg workforce whittle away.

‚ÄúThey just keep increasing the amount of the coach that has to be done in the U.S. for American jobs‚Äù Seys explains. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really just chipping away at the amount of work that‚Äôs being done here in Canada.‚Äù

In late 2018 for example New Flyer announced it would be transferring about 90 jobs from its Winnipeg plant to a facility in Shepherdsville Kentucky in order to stay in line with U.S. content requirements ‚Äî which jumped to the 70 per cent mark in 2019. Those job transfers Seys says cut an entire department manufacturing electrical components. The electrical component workstation was replaced with a socially distant cafeteria during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Seys now represents just 600 members in the Winnipeg plant as well as a few hundred at an NFI Group-owned fiberglass manufacturer in the city. The Winnipeg plant has stopped completing full builds and now sends all its buses ‚Äî even the ones slated for Canadian transit agencies ‚Äî to the United States for completion. The content rules have had ‚Äúgrievous effects‚Äù on New Flyer‚Äôs jobs he says.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame because if Canadian taxpayer dollars are being spent to buy buses and infrastructure here they should have a positive impact on employment here‚Äù says Seys. ‚ÄúWe have good-paying jobs hard-working people we have the skills we have the ability and we have the space to do it.‚Äù

Seys doesn‚Äôt blame the company for the losses ‚Äî their hands are tied he says ‚Äî it‚Äôs the federal government that has dropped the ball for Canadian workers.

‚ÄúIt hurts me to a core because New Flyer has always touted the Winnipeg plant as the flagship in terms of quality in terms of safety in terms of productivity‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey wish they could bring more [jobs] back here. It‚Äôs the American laws that are causing this problem.‚Äù

Canadian content rules for manufacturing could be a boon for business in transit manufacturing hubs like Manitoba and help protect Canadian workers from losing jobs to the United States. Photo: Mikaela Mackenzie / Winnipeg Free Press

Seys has been working with Unifor members across the industry to reach out to ‚Äúanyone that will listen‚Äù and lobby for ‚Äúa firm commitment to bring jobs back to Canada.‚Äù The government he says has a responsibility to either enact content rules of its own or pressure the U.S. to level the playing field.

‚ÄúI want to see the transit industry taken care of‚Äù Seys says. ‚ÄúI want to see rules around keeping job retention here and keeping offshore products out of here; I would also like to see them put pressure on the U.S. to maybe level this off and share in the sandbox so to speak.‚Äù

So far only the Ontario and Quebec provincial governments have tried their hand at local content rules. Any transit bus procured with public funds for an Ontario or Quebec city ‚Äî including the hundreds of hybrid buses New Flyer has been contracted to build for the TTC ‚Äî must contain at least 25 per cent Canadian content.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think at our government levels federally or provincially that we‚Äôve pushed the Can-Con issue‚Äù says Petrunic. ‚ÄúBut in transit we have a lot of jobs to lose if we don‚Äôt.‚Äù

In recent months Canada has locked horns with the United States over content rules for electric passenger vehicles ‚Äî and won. An early draft of America‚Äôs Inflation Reduction Act would have mandated any electric vehicles eligible for U.S. consumer tax credits be made with predominantly U.S. content but Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland and trade minister Mary Ng fought back arguing such rules would violate the Canada-U.S. Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) and ultimately decimate the auto manufacturing industry in Canada. After more than 1000 interactions with American officials the bill was amended to widen the eligibility to North American-made vehicles.

‚ÄúIndustrial policy in Canada has just missed looking at transit manufacturing as a sexy big job employer but it is and it needs to be respected as such.‚Äù Josipa Petrunic Canadian Urban Transit Research and Innovation Consortium

While Canada has celebrated the advocacy for auto-sector jobs the transit industry has felt sorely left behind.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big problem right now‚Äù Petrunic says. ‚ÄúNobody is advocating for the transit manufacturing sector to be included.‚Äù

The auto industry in Canada boasts between 400000 and 500000 manufacturing jobs primarily in Ontario. But in 2020 Petrunic and the team at the consortium assessed the number of jobs produced by the transit manufacturing and electrification sector ‚Äî from manufacturing to power generation ‚Äî and found about 300000 jobs in the industry including 100000 manufacturing jobs.

‚ÄúIndustrial policy in Canada has just missed looking at transit manufacturing as a sexy big job employer but it is and it needs to be respected as such‚Äù Petrunic says. ‚ÄúUs not respecting it means that it‚Äôs stagnated and hasn‚Äôt grown to employ people at the level it could ‚Äî these are good paying jobs and they‚Äôre highly skilled jobs.‚Äù

How to protect Canada‚Äôs green jobs

Sitting outside at The Forks Market in Winnipeg earlier this week following a funding announcement to grow women entrepreneurship in Canada trade minister Ng makes one point clear: ‚ÄúI do not like American protectionism.‚Äù

But countering with Canadian protectionism ‚Äî in the form of stringent Canadian content regulations ‚Äî isn‚Äôt as simple as it seems. Canada is bound by trade agreements with several major markets and enforcing more aggressive content rules could put Canada in violation of those agreements. In other words the same argument that won protection for Canadian players in the auto industry could also be used to argue against Canadian content rules.

In the latest federal budget Ng and Freeland instead put forward the idea of consulting with Canadian industries about a reciprocal procurement program.

‚ÄúReciprocal procurement means that we will buy from you as much as you buy from us‚Äù Ng says.

What exactly such a reciprocity agreement could look like is still to be determined. Ng says the government is in the process of speaking to business leaders about how such a program could work but stressed such a deal could put Canada ‚Äî which is the largest customer to industries in over 30 U.S. states ‚Äî ‚Äúin a good position.‚Äù

Back at New Flyer King says Canadian content rules like Ontario‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt get in the way of the company‚Äôs workflow. In fact he says more Canadian content rules could help stimulate work on this side of the border.

‚ÄúTo drive more Canadian activity there‚Äôs always content rules which will just naturally drive some of those decisions because manufacturers and transit agencies will have to ensure that procurements meet those rules‚Äù King says.

During the quarterly results call CEO Paul Soubry even teased the possibility of all-Canadian builds in the coming years.

‚ÄúWithout letting too many cats out of the bag‚Äù Soubry said. ‚Äú(The company) is looking at scenarios of all-Canadian builds going forward ‚Äî and those kinds of things to allow us to satisfy what we think to be a pretty encouraging Canadian market.‚Äù

But before New Flyer can take on the workload of all-Canadian bus manufacturing King says the country needs to bolster its workforce. Most transit agencies have been working on diesel and natural gas buses for decades he explains so shifting those jobs to the clean energy sector with all new infrastructure and parts can be complicated. The solution he says is a dedicated federal investment in workforce development.

‚ÄúAnything around that focus on workforce development ‚Äî investing in people investing in training ‚Äî is really going to go a long way‚Äù King says.

But creating more job availability on this side of the border goes beyond university training programs. Petrunic suggests incentive programs such as grants or scholarships tied to staying in Canada to work could help with talent retention as could dedicated advertising and marketing for the sector‚Äôs clean energy jobs. King adds that grants for companies looking to offer on-the-job reskilling programs could also support job security in a changing economy.

Speaking for the Unifor members Seys adds the workplace is a great place for trade workers to learn new transferable skills but that kind of training requires an influx of cash.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre always trying to get more people into the trades. Well put your money where your mouth is‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe need to have funding and education and places to go.‚Äù

So far the federal government has made no promises around workforce development. Ng says she recognizes there‚Äôs ‚Äúmore work to do‚Äù in levelling the playing field between Canada and the United States but stopped short of hinting at any specific federal efforts aimed at strengthening the transit sector.

Asked about the job losses at New Flyer thanks to American content rules Ng only offered general comments saying the government ‚Äú‚Äã‚Äãwill keep working with Canadian industries ‚Ä¶ in particular those that are building a green economy‚Äù in order to ‚Äúsupport their growth.‚Äù

Ng pointed to the federal government‚Äôs recent investments in transit infrastructure ‚Äî including the zero-emission transit fund ‚Äî as evidence of a new federal commitment to meeting climate goals and creating liveable cities while noting the government plans to work with provinces and the private sector to ‚Äúmake sure that the skills of the future ‚Ä¶ encourages and enables more workers in what is going to be the green economy.‚Äù

But on the floor in Winnipeg‚Äôs bus plant New Flyer is taking things one step at a time. The company is still struggling to work its way through the supply chain disruptions that have marked the last two years but there‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9taW5uZXNvdGFzLWJpZy1vaWwtbGF3c3VpdC1iZWNvbWVzLWFuLWlzc3VlLWluLWFnLXJhY2UvNjAwMTk5ODg4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minnesota's 'Big Oil' lawsuit becomes an issue in attorney general's race,"A lawsuit by Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to hold large fossil fuel firms responsible for deceiving the public on climate change has become a campaign issue as Ellison defends his seat this year.

Jim Schultz his newly minted Republican challenger has made an issue of the suit on the campaign trail. In an interview he described it as ""frivolous"" and said the Attorney General's Office should focus on violent crime by hiring more prosecutors in that area.

""It has zero chance at succeeding"" Schultz said of the fossil fuel lawsuit. ""It's fundamentally motivated by headlines and pleasing one side of the political aisle.""

Minnesota's isn't the only climate change lawsuit in the court system right now ‚Äî there are more than 20 from cities counties and states across the country. Very few have been dismissed.

""This lawsuit is in the long and successful tradition of Minnesota attorneys general standing up to protect Minnesotans from corporate fraud and deception by Big Tobacco Big Pharma and now Big Oil"" Ellison wrote in an e-mailed statement. ""This is what Minnesotans expect from their attorney general. It's the right fight to be having.""

The litigation argues that the American Petroleum Institute ExxonMobil and Koch Industries misled Minnesota consumers for years about the consequences of burning oil and gas. It argues that the state ""has already experienced billions of dollars of economic harm due to climate change"" and without action ""will continue to suffer billions of dollars of damage through midcentury.""

There is broad scientific agreement that burning fossil fuels has overheated the planet by belching carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere supercharging disasters like floods droughts and wildfires.

In the suit Minnesota asks for the defendants to publish any research they possess relating to climate change and to fund a public education campaign about climate change. It also asks for unspecified restitution and damages.

It's still not clear how judges and juries would view this legal maneuver to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable or if the questions will even get their day in court.

A wave of litigation

Minnesota's lawsuit and similar ones elsewhere hinge on the claim that fossil fuel companies duped consumers even as they knew that burning oil and gas would make the planet hotter said Korey Silverman-Roati a fellow with the Sabin Canter for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. Michael Burger the executive director of the center also works with Sher Edling the law firm handling Minnesota's case and others.

The cases are largely stuck on the same question: whether they should be heard in state or federal court. Almost all were originally filed in state court and the defendants have tried to move them to federal venues.

""This wave of litigation started in 2017 so we're coming up on the fifth year of these cases and we're still sort of mired in this"" Silverman-Roati said.

Oil companies and other defendants argue that as a national or international issue climate change should be heard in a federal courtroom.

But if they are heard there they face the hurdle of a 2011 Supreme Court case that makes it harder to claim fossil fuel emissions are a nuisance under federal common law. The case American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut determined that the Clean Air Act not lawsuits are the way to deal with some of these claims Silverman-Roati said.

So if the cases do stay in federal court and the court decides they're being pursued under common law they're in danger of being dismissed.

One case in New York that originated in federal court has since been dismissed. But in cases that were first filed at the state level federal courts and appeals courts have uniformly been sending them back there for consideration Silverman-Roati said.

Consumers and criminals

Minnesota's suit was filed in 2020. American Petroleum Institute is an industry group. One of the two oil companies sued Koch Industries runs the Pine Bend Oil Refinery in Rosemount though a subsidiary Flint Hills Resources which is also a named defendant.

The lawsuit cites internal corporate research particularly from ExxonMobil conducted as far back as the late 1950s that showed burning fossil fuels was increasing planet-warming gases in the atmosphere. It also includes examples of internal strategy documents from the late 1980s onward that call for injecting uncertainty into scientific discussions of global warming.

The litigation is in limbo at the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals as Minnesota argues it should be sent back to state court. Oral arguments were held in January. John Stiles a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office said in an email that an appeals decision isn't expected before this autumn at the soonest.

In an email an ExxonMobil spokesman wrote that the suit was ""a waste of millions of dollars of taxpayer money"" and doesn't reduce the risks of climate change. An API spokeswoman wrote that in the past two decades the industry ""has achieved its goal of providing affordable reliable American energy to U.S. consumers while substantially reducing emissions."" A spokesman for Flint Hills wrote that the firm strongly disputes ""any allegation that our company has ever been deceptive or dishonest with respect to the issue of the changing climate.""

Including Koch Industries sets Minnesota's suit apart from others across the country. Pine Bend produces about half of the gasoline sold in Minnesota according to research cited in the suit. It employs more than 1000 people according to the refinery's website.

Schultz argued the claims in the suit would fall apart. Asked whether the office should have a role in addressing climate change Schultz said ""The Attorney General's Office is not supposed to be engaging in far left political activism or activism of any kind.""

He added ""I will not engage in things like this that are fundamentally about business harassment.""

Ellison however argued in an e-mail that ""ExxonMobil Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute knew for decades their industries were a major source of climate change and were causing Minnesotans long-term harm.""

Some of the gas-powered cars are so noisy the Associated Press recently described them as ‚Äúthundering.‚Äù

But interest worldwide in electric cars brings up this question: Can a muscle car go electric?

The carmaker Stellantis makes the Dodge Challenger and Charger‚Äîtwo well-known muscle cars. General Motors makes the popular Chevrolet Corvette. Both companies are wondering if they can keep the interest of buyers who love traditional gas-powered cars.

Car fans who loved the classic powerful cars that used a lot of fuel are called ‚Äúgearheads.‚Äù

The new battery-powered cars are quicker than the old gas-powered cars that sold themselves based on ‚Äúhorsepower.‚Äù Horsepower is a term used to talk about the power created by an engine. For years high horsepower signaled ‚Äúhigh performance.‚Äù

While the new cars go fast and are easier to control than cars with big engines they do not make much noise. Will the gearheads someday become battery-heads?

Stellantis hopes so. The company which is half American and half Italian will stop making gas-powered versions of the Challenger Charger and its larger Chrysler 300 by the end of 2023.

Other automakers are in the process of doing the same thing.

Many European automakers already have electric versions of their high-performance cars. They include Porsche Audi and Mercedes.

General Motors said it will soon make an electric Corvette. Polestar is an electric vehicle company started by the owners of Volvo. Polestar says a roadster ‚Äì or small fun car ‚Äì is coming soon.

Governments around the world are requiring cars to create less pollution. U.S. President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration also recently put in place new rules.

As a result car makers are starting to center their production on electric cars. Some car factories are being updated so they can make electric vehicles. Other producers are building new factories.

Tim Kuniskis leads the Dodge division for Stellantis. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tough‚Äù he said when discussing the idea that governments are considering financial punishments known as fines for companies that do not meet new requirements to reduce fuel use.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or EPA said Stellantis‚Äô cars use the most fuel and have the worst effect on the environment. Some of the cars such as one version of the Charger with a big engine called the Hemi Hellcat travel only about five kilometers on a liter of fuel.

New rules put in place by the EPA say all of a company‚Äôs new car models must be much more fuel efficient by 2026 than they are now.

Sam Abuelsamid is a researcher for Guidehouse Insights. He said some carmakers will keep making models with traditional engines known as internal combustion engines for about 10 years.

Dodge is working to improve its cars‚Äô use of fuel but also keep the gearheads interested. The new cars will make noise like the old ones even if they are using batteries.

A recent demonstration by Dodge showed off a Charger that made noise just like a muscle car.

Kuniskis however is a critic of his own company‚Äôs new car. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have the emotion‚Äù he said speaking of the electric cars. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have the drama. It doesn‚Äôt have the dangerous feeling‚Äù of an internal combustion engine. But he did say that the new electric Charger would be the fastest ever.

Rick Nelson likes the old cars. He owns a company that fixes muscle cars in Illinois. He said it might be a ‚Äúhard sell‚Äù to get older drivers who grew up with big loud cars to switch to electric ones.

But times are changing. Nelson said he knows of businesses that are starting to think about how to put electric driving systems into the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù cars.

He said ‚ÄúGuys like me are just going to frown on it and laugh at it.‚Äù But he knows as he put it ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt about my generation.‚Äù

Kuniskis said the future is not the end of the muscle car.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust let us show you what the future looks like.‚Äù

I‚Äôm Dan Friedell. And I'm Jill Robbins.

The chain has around 7000 properties across six continents and all of them ‚Äî even the most luxurious Conrad and Waldorf Astoria properties ‚Äî can be booked with points.

You're not just restricted to hotel stays. There are other ways to redeem Hilton Honors points that can provide value. So I'll review your options for redeeming Hilton Honors points in this guide.

Redeem Hilton points for hotel stays

Hilton Honors is a hotel loyalty program so naturally you can redeem your points for hotel stays in the Hilton portfolio. Unfortunately the program doesn't provide a published award chart so your only way to know the award price is to search for your dates.

A good starting point though is the program's Points Explorer tool. This tool highlights the maximum award rate of a property as well as the lowest price recently booked by other members. However these ""discounted"" prices tend to come up when cash prices are lower.

TPG pegs Hilton Honors points at 0.6 cents per point. However given the form of variable pricing the program uses this valuation will vary from hotel to hotel.

For example I found a night at the Conrad Washington D.C. that is bookable for $309 with the Hilton Honors semi-flex discount rate or for 80000 Hilton points. You'll get a redemption value of just 0.38 cents per point if you redeem points.

On the other hand some hotels will give you more than 0.6 cents in redemption value. This usually happens when you get to a property's maximum standard award rate (which is now as high as 120000 Hilton points per night). An example on New Year's Eve the Hampton Inn Grand Central in New York City costs $969.69 per night using the Honors discount rate.

Alternatively you can book the same king room for 70000 points per night giving you a valuation of 1.39 cents per point.

To book an award room start at hilton.com and click ""Sign in"" at the top right. Enter your credentials then click ""Sign in.""

After typing in your city and dates select ""Special rates"" and ensure that you tick the ""Use points"" option. You could also start your search directly from the Hilton Honors homepage and log in later. Again check the ""Use points"" box to see award rates in the search results.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

Select the property you'd like to book from the results page and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the reservation. Just be sure to pay close attention to the individual hotel's cancellation policy. Most award stays are free to cancel until a couple of days before arrival but some properties have stricter policies.

There are a few other options that you can utilize when redeeming Hilton Honors points for a stay. As you go through the booking process keep your eyes out for the following booking options.

Customize your award with the points and money slider

In addition to booking stays completely with points the Hilton Honors program allows you to use a combination of points and money.

Unlike many other programs that use a fixed number of points and cash for this award option Hilton lets you customize the amount using a slider on the final page before confirming your reservation. You'll still select the full award price from the search results but then you can drag the slider to whatever points and money combination you want:

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

Note that there is a 5000-point minimum for points and money redemptions. The combination of points and money you select is final once you book. However you will earn Hilton Honors points on the cash portion of these stays. So if you're short on points or don't want to burn all your points on one stay this can be a nice option.

Redeem points for premium room awards

One of the best things about Hilton Honors redemptions is that you're not restricted to one room type. You can redeem points for premium rooms including those with better views club lounge access or suites.

The booking process is the same. Once you've selected your desired hotel you can choose between a standard room reward and premium room rewards like this example at the Conrad London St. James.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

As you can see premium rooms will cost more points than standard rooms. In some cases (like the above) it's likely not worth it.

However if you're looking for extra space for your family it's great to have the option to burn additional points for a suite or larger room instead of hoping your Hilton elite status will score you an upgrade at check-in.

Fifth night free for Hilton Honors elite members

Anyone with Hilton Honors Silver status or higher gets every fifth night free when booking a standard room reward stay. This perk extends to stays of up to 20 nights ‚Äî during which you'd enjoy four free nights. If you don't have Hilton Honors status consider applying for one of Hilton's American Express cards for automatic status.

Redeem Hilton points for event credits

You can also use Hilton Honors points for a discount on your next Hilton event (but please don't). This can be a wedding corporate event or other types of meetings. When redeeming Hilton points for these discounts you can choose from different denominations of vouchers. Here's how much they cost:

25000 points = $50.

50000 points = $100.

75000 points = $150.

125000 points = $250.

250000 points = $500.

These vouchers provide just 0.2 cents per Hilton point. This is well below TPG's valuation of Hilton points (0.6 cents per point) and isn't a redemption we recommend.

How to redeem Hilton points for experiences

You can also redeem Hilton Honors points for travel experiences through Hilton Experiences.

Available experiences often include tickets to sporting events dinner at top restaurants concert tickets and more. Some of these can be purchased immediately with points while others require you to bid against other Hilton Honors members.

There are some pretty neat experiences available as of writing this piece including the ultimate Sunday brunch at Conrad Centennial Singapore and a Gintastic tasting with a Czech gin aficionado in Prague.

While you're generally best off redeeming hotel points for hotel stays snagging a unique experience using your points can make for a fantastic redemption. This is how TPG's Katie Genter recently enjoyed a 60-minute couples massage and a 4-course dinner for two with just 20000 Hilton Honors points.

Look through the Hilton Honors Experiences page to see if anything strikes your fancy.

How to transfer Hilton points to airlines

Hilton Honors has 27 loyalty partners to which you can transfer your Hilton Honors points.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

However note that Hilton Honors has less-than-ideal transfer ratios. For example you can exchange 10000 Hilton Honors points for a mere 1000 Delta SkyMiles. Transfer ratios vary from one airline to the next so check Hilton's transfer site for your airline of choice.

Redeem Hilton points on Lyft rides

Hilton has a partnership with Lyft which is a fantastic way to earn some extra Hilton points on your Lyft rides. On the redemption side however it's not so pretty.

(Screenshot from lyft-loyaltywallet.points.com)

You can convert your Hilton points to a Lyft credit ‚Äî similar to a gift card. Regardless of how much you convert to a Lyft credit you'll get a piddly 0.22 cents per dollar.

Redeem Hilton points for car rentals

Hilton has a partnership with National Alamo and Enterprise so you can redeem your points for a car rental. However this option doesn't provide a good return on your hard-earned points. In our tests using points for a rental car consistently provided 0.2 cents per point.

For example a four-day intermediate car rental with National at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) costs nearly 250000 points.

(Screenshot from hilton.loyaltytravelrewards.com)

You can reserve the same car for around $90 per day (and significantly less with a university code).

Redeem Hilton points for Amazon purchases

Finally you can redeem Hilton Honors points to cover Amazon purchases. Just link your Hilton Honors account to your Amazon account and select Hilton Honors points as your payment method at checkout. Amazon will tell you how many points it takes to cover your order and you can use your points to cover the entire order or just part of your purchase.

Should you use Hilton Honors points for Amazon purchases? Our research found that Hilton Honors points are worth 0.2 cents per point when redeemed toward Amazon purchases. This means you're effectively cutting the currency's valuation by two-thirds.

I'm all for having additional options for using your points and miles but in general you should never use Hilton points (nor any other currency) at Amazon.

How to earn Hilton points

Of course all of the above redemptions require you to have Hilton points in your account. Fortunately there are various ways to earn more Hilton Honors points. One of the quickest ways to do so is by adding a new Hilton Honors card to your wallet. Here are the currently available options and their welcome offers:

The information for the Hilton Aspire card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Bottom line

As you can see there are many interesting ways to redeem Hilton Honors points. However we recommend sticking with hotel stays ‚Äî this generally provides the most value getting you closer to (or even higher than) TPG's valuation of 0.6 cents per Hilton point.

The other option I'd recommend considering is Hilton Honors Experiences especially if you're looking for a unique event that may not be otherwise available to you.

American Airlines' pet policy

(Photo by Capuski/Getty Images)

American Airlines only allows passengers to carry on cats and dogs; no other types of pets are allowed. According to the American Airlines pet policy you can bring a cat or dog along (assuming they meet the size and age requirements) on most flights up to 12 hours or flights to or from the following locations:

The 48 contiguous United States.

The United States and Canada.

Alaska.

Mexico.

Puerto Rico.

St. Croix U.S. Virgin Islands.

St. Thomas U.S. Virgin Islands.

American Airlines charges a $125 charge for each one-way itinerary where your pet accompanies you in the cabin. You'll also incur an additional $125 charge on any one-way itinerary within the U.S. with more than a four-hour voluntary stopover. You might be able to recoup some or all of the fees if you charge it on a credit card that offers airline fee credits.

Additionally the American Airlines pet policy prohibits pets from traveling in first or business class on the following aircraft types:

777-200.

777-300.

787-8.

787-9.

You'll want to make sure you book your pet early as part of your reservation. Unlike the United Airlines pet policy American Airlines publishes the number of pets allowed in the cabin on each flight. So we know American Airlines only allows up to seven kennels on its mainline flights (although service animals don't count toward this limit).

You may unsubscribe at any time.

Meanwhile American will only accept five kennels per flight ‚Äî and a maximum of one carrier in first class ‚Äî for American Eagle flights. While American has largely eliminated change fees you'll be stuck rescheduling your trip if your particular flight has already reached its cap for in-cabin animals.

Lastly American Airlines considers a pet carrier a carry-on item. So if you're bringing along a pet you'll only be permitted a personal item along with your pet carrier. Any other bags will need to be checked with the appropriate fees applied.

American Airlines' pet carrier requirements

The American Airlines pet policy allows for both hard-sided and soft-sided carriers. Hard-sided carriers have different size restrictions based on whether your flight is on American Airlines or American Eagle American's regional carrier.

Hard-sided kennels can be no larger than 19 inches by 13 inches by 9 inches on mainline flights and no larger than 16 inches by 12 inches by 8 inches on American Eagle flights. However the American Airlines pet policy recommends soft-sided carriers which can be no larger than 18 inches by 11 inches by 11 inches on both mainline and American Eagle flights.

Lastly the American pet policy states that the animal must be able to stand up and turn around in the pet carrier.

American Airlines will only allow a pet to travel in cargo if you are a member of the U.S. military on active duty or a U.S. State Department Foreign Service employee traveling on official orders. There are several additional requirements for a pet traveling in cargo which you can find on the American Airlines website.

The only way to use the American Airlines pet policy is to call reservations to add a pet to your reservation. An agent will be able to help you with adding a pet to your record assuming there is still capacity for kennels on your preferred flights.

Bottom line

The American Airlines pet policy can make it challenging to travel with your pet. You won't be able to bring anything other than a cat or dog on board. And American is one of several airlines that severely restrict the ability to have your animal travel in the cargo hold.

The American Airlines pet policy contains some restrictions on the size of kennels on certain flights and destinations. Finally American Airlines will only accept a certain number of pets in the cabin per flight so you'll need to reserve space for your pet early.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jaXRpZXMvY2hhbmRpZ2FyaC9wZ2ktaW5zdGFsbHMtMTItZGlnaXRhbC1wYXltZW50LW1hY2hpbmVzLTgxMDIzMzIv0gFqaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NpdGllcy9jaGFuZGlnYXJoL3BnaS1pbnN0YWxscy0xMi1kaWdpdGFsLXBheW1lbnQtbWFjaGluZXMtODEwMjMzMi9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PGI installs 12 digital payment machines,"For many patients and attendants the new facility means having to spend less time making payments and shorter queues (Representational)

The short version goes: I quit my job at the end of 2019 to focus full-time on financial planning and freelance writing. The underlying motivation was to have more time to travel.

No longer bound by a set number of vacation days and with work that could be done from anywhere with an internet connection we planned some epic trips for 2020.

You know what happened next. Trip to Italy ‚Äì cancelled. Trip to the UK ‚Äì cancelled. Two years later with a lot of pent-up demand to continue this vision of our rich life we embarked on our revenge travel year.

A week in Maui 3.5 weeks in Italy 3.5 weeks in the UK and another eight days coming up in Paris this fall. It has been a crazy and exciting year.

Planning Your Revenge Travel Year

Many of you also have a pent-up demand for travel and have either managed to get away this year or plan to do so in 2023.

Your ideal destinations may differ from mine but if you‚Äôre itching to travel soon then I suggest you start planning now. Here‚Äôs how to plan your own revenge travel year:

Time and Place

My wife and I like to plan our trips at least a year or two in advance so we can properly allocate our travel spending.

Like any financial goal it helps to have a rough idea of how much you‚Äôll spend plus a time-frame so you can work backwards and ensure an appropriate savings plan.

For example you might budget $5000 for a warm holiday next February. That means saving $833 per month for the next six months to reach your goal.

A budget nerd like me maps out spending for an entire year so I know which months will incur the big expenses.

A more sensible approach might be to set up a sub-savings account for your travel goal. That kind of mental accounting can be a useful part of your financial plan.

Transportation and Accommodation

How will you get there? Plane train automobile? Where will you stay? Hotel Airbnb in a friend‚Äôs guest room?

Are you a luxury traveller flying business class and staying at the Ritz Carlton? Or are you happy with an economy flight and a Best Western? Will you need to rent a car?

We flew business class from Calgary to Rome and then again from London to Calgary. I‚Äôm not going to lie it‚Äôs pretty nice to actually get some rest in a lie-flat seat and not arrive completely wiped out after a nine-hour flight. But the economy flight back from Rome wasn‚Äôt all that bad.

We also love staying in nice hotels when it‚Äôs just me and my wife enjoying a kid-free getaway. Otherwise it‚Äôs Airbnbs for the extra space and the kitchen.

I bring up transportation and accommodation because it‚Äôs helpful to know which airline you‚Äôre going to fly with which hotel chain you‚Äôll stay at and which rental car agency you‚Äôll use.

Most airlines hotels and car rental agencies have their own loyalty program or belong to a coalition where you can earn points get discounts and receive other perks. Sticking to the same 1-2 brands and joining their loyalty programs can help augment your travel budget each and every year.

Rewards and Loyalty Programs

I‚Äôve been a credit card rewards addict for many years. But I don‚Äôt just blindly apply for any credit card with a decent welcome bonus. Instead I‚Äôm laser focused on earning points that I can use when I travel and using credit cards that can help me accumulate those points in a hurry.

My top loyalty programs for travel include:

Aeroplan

WestJet / RBC Rewards

Marriott Bonvoy

Scotia Scene+

TD Rewards

Aeroplan is easily the best value of the bunch. Expect to redeem Aeroplan points at a value of 2 cents per mile. That‚Äôs at least twice the value of most other programs where you can expect to redeem points at a rate of 0.50 cents to 1 cent per point.

We focus on Aeroplan because flights for four of us to Europe or Maui are expensive. Redeeming Aeroplan points has helped us save thousands of dollars on flights.

I also collect WestJet Dollars from time-to-time as WestJet is sometimes a good choice for flying out of Lethbridge and for short haul trips to Vancouver. It‚Äôs good to have options. RBC Rewards can also be converted to WestJet Dollars.

I collect Bonvoy points because Marriott has the largest collection of hotels in the world and will almost always have an option in the area if we need a hotel.

We had a lovely stay at the Sheraton in Edinburgh and at the Westin Dublin in 2019 and with Marriott‚Äôs fifth-night free option we saved a bundle. We also like the free night certificate that comes attached to their Amex affiliated credit card.

Finally a couple of supplementary loyalty programs (like Scotia Scene+ and TD Rewards) always come in handy to redeem for car rentals hotels or tickets to an attraction.

For example I had more than 100000 TD Rewards points ($500) and redeemed the points for a car rental in England this summer.

The point is to zero-in on a select few rewards programs that align with your trip or with the way you like to travel and start racking up points.

Maybe you can shave off $1000 from that $5000 trip just by strategically using your points. Or like I do sometimes use those points to enhance your stay with a business class ticket upgrade to a suite with a view or to see an attraction you might have otherwise deemed too expensive.

Top Credit Cards for Travel

Okay so which credit cards are best to use for collecting travel points? I wish there was an easy answer but if you‚Äôre planning a revenge travel year soon you‚Äôre going to need a complete overhaul of your wallet.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm packing:

American Express Cobalt Card ‚Äì Simply put this is the best credit card in Canada for earning points for travel. New cardholders will get 2500 points for each month in which they spend $500 (30000 total). That‚Äôs in addition to earning 5x points on groceries. Sign up for this card use it for $500 per month worth of your grocery (or dining) spending and after 12 months you‚Äôll have 60000 Membership Rewards Points. These can be transferred to Aeroplan or Marriott or used to redeem against purchases made on your card. American Express Platinum Card ‚Äì Go big or go home. You‚Äôve got an epic year of travel planned you need an epic credit card (even for just one year). Yes the Amex Platinum card comes with a $699 annual fee. But do the math and you‚Äôll see the card easily pays for itself and more. Sign up for this card and you‚Äôll get: Airport lounge access a $200 travel credit plus 115000 points when you spend $6000 in the first three months. Again these can be transferred to Aeroplan or Marriott or used to redeem against purchases made on your card. Time this application to coincide with a large one-time purchase (home or auto insurance for us). Cancel the card after your year of revenge travel or keep it if you find it useful (I do). American Express Aeroplan Reserve Card ‚Äì Another premium card option for a big year of travel ahead. This one comes with a $599 annual fee but also some incredible perks like Maple Leaf Lounge Access priority check-in boarding and baggage handling (all of which came in handy for us this year). Sign up for this card and you can earn up to 115000 Aeroplan points when you reach the minimum spending thresholds. Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card ‚Äì I‚Äôve held this card for years because of the annual free night certificate which I think easily pays for the $120 annual fee. We redeemed the hotel certificate for one-night stays in London and in Rome near the airport before our flight and at the Marriott in-terminal hotel in Calgary before an early departure. Sign up for this card and earn 70000 Bonvoy points when you spend $3000 in the first three months. As I said this one is a long-term keeper.

Next I have a strategy to earn additional points from holding RBC and TD Cards. Here‚Äôs what I do:

WestJet RBC World Elite MasterCard / RBC Avion Visa Infinite ‚Äì I‚Äôve held each of these cards at one time or another. They often have great sign-up bonuses for doing very little (welcome bonus on approval or on first purchase) which makes them a no-brainer option for someone looking to accumulate points quickly and hassle-free. TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite / TD First Class Travel Visa Infinite Card ‚Äì Same idea I will often hold one or both of these cards to collect easy sign-up bonuses. The Aeroplan Visa obviously helps accelerate your Aeroplan points while the First Class Travel Visa earns TD Rewards which can be redeemed for a number of things ‚Äì most notably through Expedia for TD (where I redeemed points for that rental car in England).

What I like about the TD and RBC cards besides the easy to earn welcome bonuses is that you don‚Äôt have to cancel your card before the next year‚Äôs annual fee comes due. You can downgrade to a no-fee card or make a ‚Äúproduct switch‚Äù from Aeroplan to First Class (and vice-versa) or from Avion to WestJet (and vice-versa) so you keep your credit file open and won‚Äôt take a credit hit for closing the account.

Ready Player Two?

Most credit cards come with the option of having a supplementary card ‚Äì a second card for your spouse or partner to use on the same credit card account. Some even charge an annual fee for this ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù. No thanks!

Instead why not have your spouse or partner apply for their own credit card and take advantage of another welcome bonus?

That‚Äôs right activate the player two in your household.

For American Express cards there‚Äôs an added incentive to activate your player two. The referral program. Player one shares his or her referral link for player two to use to sign up. Player one earns a referral bonus of between 5000 and 20000 points and player two can earn the welcome bonus on a brand new card.

To see this in action imagine you have grocery spending in excess of $1000 per month (not hard these days amirite?).

Player one applies for the American Express Cobalt card and starts using it for grocery purchases. Player one then refers player two to sign-up for their own Cobalt card. Player one receives a 5000 referral bonus. Now both player one and player two put $500 per month worth of groceries onto their respective Cobalt cards to max out both the welcome bonus and the 5x points multiplier.

Related: How to Maximize your American Express Membership Rewards Points

The result is 125000 Membership Rewards points (60k + 60k + 5k). Transferred to Aeroplan and that‚Äôs worth $2500 in flight rewards. Yes you need to subtract the $12.99 monthly fees for both Cobalt cards ($311.86). You‚Äôre still ahead by $2188 in rewards value.

Giving You The Business

Do you own a small business? Some of the most lucrative travel rewards credit cards are actually small business credit cards.

Take the American Express Business Platinum Card which both my wife and I hold. It comes with a $499 fee (no annual travel credit) and offers a welcome bonus of 120000 points when you spend $10000 in the first three months.

Sign up for this card and you‚Äôll get all of the Platinum benefits including complimentary airport lounge access. The fee may also be deductible if used solely for business purposes.

Most of the big banks also offer a suite of business credit cards. I currently hold the TD Aeroplan Visa Business Card which currently has a better promotion than the personal version of the card. The same is true for most business cards at other banks.

Final Thoughts

Our revenge travel year has us going to Europe three times plus a beautiful stay in Maui. We flew business class twice with one more coming up from Calgary to Paris. We rented some amazing Airbnbs and splurged on hotels at or near major airports before our flights for convenience.

Keep in mind this has been three years in the making. We originally booked our trips to Italy and the UK in 2019 (for 2020). When we cancelled Aeroplan points went back into our account and pre-booked Airbnbs were refunded.

With nowhere to go in 2020 the travel budget ballooned. We also continued earning points at a pretty decent clip by following the strategies I‚Äôve written about here.

All of that culminated into our revenge travel year this year.

But this was by design. It was intentional. And we didn‚Äôt completely blow our travel points budget either (although it could use a top-up). We might take some time off travelling in 2023 while we settle into our new house but we‚Äôre already actively planning and building up points for future adventures.

Finally since this needs to be said please be responsible with your credit cards. Don‚Äôt go out and apply for all of these at once you‚Äôll kill your credit score. Don‚Äôt overspend just for the sake of earning points. Design your minimum card spending around regular expenses. Time your new credit card sign-ups to align with large one-time expenses that you‚Äôre going to incur anyway.

And of course always pay off your card balance in full each month. In no world does earning a 2% reward beat paying 19% in interest.

Your revenge travel year might look a lot different than mine. But I hope these tips help you plan your travel save money and enhance your experience."

France made me reevaluate my work-life balance when it comes to enjoying meals. This was from a day when I ate inside Disneyland Paris' Super Spur Steakhouse. Kirsten Acuna/Insider

The first few days I was in France I was visiting Disneyland Paris for a work trip. I was really confused when we had three hours blocked off for dinner one evening.

I thought someone was going to speak but it turned out that time was just meant for people to chat network and get to know one another.

I quickly learned that wasn't a one-time thing. I noticed a lot of time and care was put into every meal experience from the amount of time we spent eating to the atmosphere of the locations.

A few days into the trip a Parisian told me it's not uncommon for coworkers to go out to lunch every day for at least an hour to brainstorm and enjoy each other's company. I was told that if I go to a restaurant they'll let me sit there for as long as I want until I ask for the check.

In the US I'm so used to taking a quick 30-minute lunch break or reconfiguring my dining schedule to accommodate work events. I never realized I'm not appreciating the things I have around me enough. I'm just running quickly from one thing to the next without allowing myself to also absorb it.

The French dining experience was a bit of a wake-up call encouraging me to slow down a bit while also inspiring me to be more present during meals and my time with others.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbGVhcm5pbmdlbmdsaXNoLnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvbmV3LXlvcmstc2t5bGluZS1oYXMtd29ybGQtcy10aGlubmVzdC1idWlsZGluZy82NzA3NDgzLmh0bWzSAWNodHRwczovL2xlYXJuaW5nZW5nbGlzaC52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3LXlvcmstc2t5bGluZS1oYXMtd29ybGQtcy10aGlubmVzdC1idWlsZGluZy82NzA3NDgzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York Skyline Has World‚Äôs Thinnest Building,"A new building stands out from the rest in New York City‚Äôs skyline.

America‚Äôs largest city is known for its many extremely tall buildings also known as skyscrapers.

The newly completed Steinway Tower is not New York‚Äôs tallest. But it is the skinniest meaning very thin.

The 84-story Steinway Tower is a housing structure. It was designed by New York building company SHoP Architects. The project was started in 2014 and completed earlier this year.

The building is being called the ‚Äúmost slender skyscraper in the world.‚Äù This is because it has a width-height relationship or ratio of 1-to-23 1/2.

Gregg Pasquarelli is a founding member of SHoP Architects. He told The Associated Press that any time a building has a 1-to-10 or more ratio it is considered a slender building. He said anything 1-to-15 or more is considered ‚Äúexotic‚Äù and ‚Äúreally difficult‚Äù to build.

‚ÄúThe most slender buildings in the world are mostly in Hong Kong and they‚Äôre around 17- or 18-to-1‚Äù Pasquarelli added.

The 60 living spaces in the tower range in cost from $18 million to $66 million. They offer 360-degree views of the city. The building sits just south of Central Park along a stretch of Manhattan‚Äôs 57th Street known as ‚ÄúBillionaires' Row.‚Äù

At 435 meters Steinway Tower is the second-tallest housing structure in the Western Hemisphere. The tallest is the nearby Central Park Tower at 470 meters.

For comparison the world‚Äôs tallest building is Dubai‚Äôs Burj Khalifa which rises 828 meters.

Steinway Tower is so thin at the top that a strong wind can cause the upper floors to sway by about a half meter.

‚ÄúEvery skyscraper has to move‚Äù Pasquarelli said. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs too stiff it‚Äôs actually more dangerous ‚Äî it has to have flexibility in it.‚Äù

To prevent the tower from swaying too far designers created a counterbalance with steel pieces. In addition about 200 rock anchors provide support from the ground.

Steinway Tower has a long history as the former site of Steinway Hall which was built in 1924. JDS Development Group and Property Markets Group bought the building in 2013. The company said it is now looking to the future.

Pasquarelli said of the new site ‚ÄúI hope it holds a special place in all future New Yorkers' hearts.‚Äù

The treatment plant is the centerpiece of the township's sewer system which a Florida company NextEra Water has agreed to buy for $115.3 million. Read more

Towamencin Township a suburban Montgomery County community with a population of about 18000 received bids in February from five suitors to acquire its municipal sewer system. The offers left township supervisors breathless.

Pennsylvania American Water the state‚Äôs largest private water utility offered to pay $92.4 million for the township‚Äôs system about 71% more than the bid of its principal rival Aqua Pennsylvania the state‚Äôs second largest water utility.

But the real shock was a bid from NextEra Water a Florida company that owns no other Pennsylvania water utilities. It offered to pay Towamencin $115.3 million for its wastewater system ‚Äî 25% more than Pennsylvania American Water and more than double Aqua‚Äôs bid of $54.1 million.

‚ÄúWhen we received two bids over $90 million to say I was surprised would be an understatement‚Äù Supervisor Richard Marino told a town hall meeting in April.

The NextEra offer of $115.3 million was ‚Äútotally out of line with what we thought we would receive‚Äù H. Charles Wilson III the chairman of the township‚Äôs board of supervisors said at the meeting. NextEra‚Äôs offer for the sewer system amounts to nearly eight times the township‚Äôs entire annual operating budget of $15 million.

The supervisors said the sale of the sewer system and its 7500 accounts to NextEra would allow Towamencin to retire its debt forestall property tax increases finance some projects immediately and stash $87 million in the bank. Future township improvements would be funded just from the interest earned on the $87 million reserve. Marino called the sale ‚Äúa generational opportunity to reboot and reset our finances for the foreseeable future.‚Äù

The township supervisors voted 4-1 in May to accept the NextEra bid over vocal objections of residents who fear that homeowners and businesses will pay higher sewer rates to cover NextEra‚Äôs elevated purchase price. The opponents are organizing a ballot campaign to rewrite the town‚Äôs charter to block the sewer system sale and reverse the ‚Äúbackdoor tax increase‚Äù on sewer customers.

Regardless of the final resolution of Towamencin‚Äôs political turmoil the sale process has been a stunning debut for NextEra Water a new player with deep pockets in the competition to buy up Pennsylvania‚Äôs fragmented municipal water and wastewater systems.

NextEra Water is a subsidiary of NextEra Energy of Juno Beach Fla. an infrastructure firm whose principal asset is an electric utility Florida Power and Light. It also owns a large portfolio of renewable energy assets.

‚ÄòThe largest company you‚Äôve never heard of‚Äô

NextEra Energy is sometimes called ‚Äúthe largest company that you‚Äôve never heard of‚Äù Bruce Hauk the president of NextEra Water said during an introductory meeting with Towamencin residents in April.

Though NextEra says it is an experienced operator of wastewater systems at its own power plants it began to explore expanding into water utilities only in the last year.

The frenzy to consolidate systems in Pennsylvania has been spurred by a 2016 state law Act 12 which has revolutionized the privatization process by incentivizing the sale of water and wastewater systems at ‚Äúfair market‚Äù prices which can be much higher than the actual book value of the assets.

Until recently the competition in Pennsylvania has largely been dominated by the nation‚Äôs two biggest investor-owned water companies both headquartered in the Philadelphia area: American Water Works Co. Inc. based in Camden and Aqua America a subsidiary of Essential Utilities Inc. of Bryn Mawr. Both are experienced at navigating the region‚Äôs political and regulatory systems vital skills for public utilities whose operations require close cooperation with government.

But private equity funds are showing heightened interest in buying municipal utilities which require ever more capital to replace aging infrastructure and to respond to new climate and environmental challenges such as contamination by compounds known as PFAS. Unlike some other states that have enacted legislation that allow only fair-market acquisitions of distressed municipal utilities Pennsylvania‚Äôs Act 12 legislation can make it attractive for any town to sell at a high price.

‚ÄúYou can really go after any system in Pennsylvania‚Äù said an investment analyst who follows the industry and was not authorized to speak publicly. ‚ÄúThat really makes the big guys open to the market. Plus Pennsylvania has scale ‚Äî it‚Äôs a large state with a lot of opportunity.‚Äù

Several investment firms have recently entered the Pennsylvania market primarily focused on leasing and not buying municipal systems which they would operate through contractors.

VICO Infrastructure a California venture that works in partnership with the the private equity giant Carlyle Group was a distant bidder in the Towamencin process. And Bernhard Capital Partners of Baton Rouge La. has been active in bidding for leases in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

NextEra Water also tried to bid for the Bucks County Water and Sewer Authority recently but was rebuffed when BCWSA last month awarded Aqua Pennsylvania the right to finalize a $1.1 billion offer for its sewer system. Bucks officials said they favored operators with a Pennsylvania track record.

Recouping $115.3 million

The question of how NextEra would recover its $115.3 million purchase price from Towamencin‚Äôs 7500 customers and the impact on rates was a central issue raised by opponents of the sale.

Christopher H. Franklin the chairman of Essential Utilities told investment analysts in October that an established water utility such as Aqua has an advantage because it can spread the cost of acquisitions and improvements across an existing customer base of nearly 500000 customers in Pennsylvania.

But a company such as NextEra which has 5.7 million electric customers in Florida can‚Äôt pass on the costs of its Pennsylvania water utility acquisitions to Florida ratepayers. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt spread their water costs on their electric customers‚Äù said Franklin said. ‚ÄúSo they‚Äôve still got to confine any rate increases for acquisitions on those customers they have.‚Äù

NextEra‚Äôs Hauk said the company did not plan to recover the full price in rates. The amount it could recover would be set by Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission based on fair-market appraisals if the sale were approved.

It seems clear to most observers that NextEra is paying an above-market price for the Towamencin system to establish a base upon which it can expand in Pennsylvania by buying other systems.

‚ÄúSometimes companies will do that to penetrate the market get their foot in the door and are fully aware that they‚Äôre probably not going to get the return on investment and recover the full 115‚Ä≥ million dollars said Supervisor Marino a contractor by trade.

Aqua ‚Äònot too worried‚Äô as NextEra expands

NextEra last year signaled its broader interest in water utilities when it announced the acquisition of a portfolio of 23 water and five wastewater utility systems in several counties surrounding Houston. The deal with Quadvest L.P. another private investor closed last month. The purchase price was undisclosed.

Rebecca Kujawa NextEra‚Äôs chief financial officer told investment analysts in October that the acquisition of the Texas properties reflected the company‚Äôs plans to create a national water utility.

‚ÄúThe proposed acquisition expands our regulated utility business in an attractive market with significant expected customer growth and furthers our strategy to build a world class water utility in the coming years‚Äù Kujawa said. ‚ÄúWe are optimistic about the strong growth anticipated in this new market and the potential for clean water solutions to generate additional contracted renewables opportunities going forward.‚Äù

Some analysts are impressed by NextEra‚Äôs expansion into water.

‚ÄúThis move provides the company with huge growth potential as the U.S. water and wastewater utility industry is highly fragmented‚Äù the Motley Fool investment advisory service said in a June blog post. ‚ÄúNextEra‚Äôs considerable financial resources give its NextEra Water subsidiary the potential to be a formidable player.‚Äù

The activity of a giant such as NextEra also did not go unnoticed in the corporate suite of Essential Utilities in Bryn Mawr. NextEra‚Äôs market valuation of $179 billion is about 13 times the market capitalization of Essential Utilities. NextEra had $17 billion in revenue last year three times the combined sales of the two Philadelphia area water companies Essential Utilities and American Water.

Franklin the chairman of Essential Utilities told analysts last year that Aqua welcomed NextEra and was ‚Äúnot too worried about‚Äù the competition.

‚ÄúAs we think about this privatization trend the more that occurs successfully the better it is‚Äù Franklin said. ‚ÄúWe think this is a pretty big market. We‚Äôve certainly been successful in our market share and we think we can continue to do that.‚Äù

A big customer objects

NextEra said it would operate the Towamencin system through a contractor U.S. Water Services Corp. an unaffiliated Florida company.

The township‚Äôs adviser on the sale Public Financial Management Inc. (PFM) projected the township‚Äôs future sewer rates if the township retained the system compared with rates under private ownership adjusted to reflect the amount each household would save in reduced property taxes if the township banked the sewer sale proceeds. PFM projected that township residents would be better off if the township sold the system.

PFM‚Äôs projections were met with skepticism by opponents who argue that PFM is not an impartial adviser: The firm stands to earn an $807000 fee ‚Äî 0.7% of the sale price ‚Äî if the deal closes next year. If there is no sale PFM makes a $9500 fee.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe the numbers that have been shown throughout the presentations are accurate‚Äù said James Lee general counsel of the Clemens Food Group the makers of Hatfield meats whose processing facility in neighboring Hatfield Township is the largest customer on the Towamencin wastewater system.

The meat producer estimates that its annual sewer fees would double to $1.6 million if the sale went through ‚Äúwhich will significantly impact our operations in Hatfield‚Äù Lee said at the April town hall. He warned the township that Clemens is ‚Äúlooking at all options to either reduce or eliminate our flow‚Äù to Towamencin should the sale go through.

In the end the township supervisors were unmoved by the opposition calling the sale a ‚Äúno brainer.‚Äù

New IEEE automotive Ethernet standards continue to emerge one of the latest being 10BASE-T1S Ethernet. This article discusses the trends in the automotive industry dictating changes in vehicle electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture and how the new 10BASE-T1S standard supports and enables this new architecture rollout.

Megatrends Providing New Opportunities

The automotive industry is presently going through one of its most revolutionary periods. Car manufacturers need to quickly provide solutions to several significant megatrends such as personalization electrification autonomy and full connectivity. OEMs will need to radically modify their E/E architecture to support the new functionality. While this revolution presents a significant technical challenge it also provides an opportunity for OEMs to consider moving E/E architectures away from domain-based solutions which have become unwieldy from continuous add-ons over platform generations. With this significant architecture change OEMs can focus on enabling a superior technical solution while also adding new post-sale revenue streams through features such as vehicle personalization sale of services and over-the-air (OTA) upgrades. The industry is gravitating toward a common new architecture often referred to as zonal architecture and looks to leverage technology and lessons from other industries most notably the IT sector‚Äîmaking the car essentially a computer on wheels.

Zonal architectures determine connectivity by physical location rather than function as was the case in domain-based architectures. This change significantly reduces the number of electronic control units (ECUs) in the vehicle and removes up to 1 km of harness cabling. Secondly it decouples hardware and software providing a service orientated architecture (SOA). Many OEMs are investing heavily to bring ownership of software in house with the aim to provide an end-to-end solution that simplifies integration of platforms and offers more cross-functional capability. This scalable software platform approach will minimize variants open opportunities to new revenue streams lead to reduced R&D investment in the longer term and shorten development times while supporting multiple car lines.

These revolutionary architecture changes come with many challenges and have led many OEMs to restructure their entire organizations away from individual groups with ownership to deliver only specific domain functions and toward more integrated cross-functional organizations.

Automotive is rapidly becoming a major consumer of Ethernet devices and widespread Ethernet rollout in vehicles is seen as one of the key pillars to the successful introduction of these new architectures. Ethernet brings the required scalability supports multiple speed grades is a proven robust transmission media supports a service-based architecture and has fully developed safety and security building blocks. Ethernet has a clearly defined and well understood OSI model that makes it easier to manage the complexity of the entire car network.

Figure 1. Automotive zonal architectures.

Unique Aspects of Automotive

While many fundamental Ethernet concepts can be leveraged from other industries the automotive E/E architecture has some unique requirements that dictate the need for new technology developments. One key focus for automotive is to reduce the weight of the vehicle which has a direct impact on vehicle range. The cable harness used today is one of the three heaviest subsystems in the vehicle (weighing up to 60 kg). Traditional Ethernet cables use four differential pairs for data transmission adding weight and routing complexity which is not optimal for automotive applications. To address this new IEEE standards were developed to support Ethernet transmission over single twisted pair cables which coupled with the reduced cable harness lengths enabled by zonal architecture can offer significant cable savings and weight reduction.

What Drives the Need for 10BASE-T1S?

As the concept of zonal-based architectures evolved it became evident that Ethernet connectivity all the way to edge sensors and actuators would be required to fully leverage the advantages of this new architecture. Existing legacy connectivity technologies such as FlexRay and CAN require protocol translation normally implemented in gateways which can add cost complexity and latency. Existing automotive Ethernet technologies such as 100BASE-T1 did not meet the system costs to support transitioning edge connectivity applications to Ethernet as this technology required the use of point-to-point switched connectivity. The result was a call for interest from the IEEE to provide a solution to this problem. Some of the key requirements included:4

Faster communication than existing technologies; for example CAN(FD)

Replacement of legacy in-vehicle networking technologies like FlexRay

An alternative to 100BASE-T1 for ECUs where 100BASE-T1 is not cost and energy efficient

The ability to support connectivity for simple and redundant sensor networks

What Is 10BASE-T1S?

The 10BASE-T1S specification was developed as part of the IEEE 802.3cg standard which was published in February 2020. 10BASE-T1S provides the missing link in the automotive Ethernet ecosystem enabling true Ethernet-to-the-edge connectivity and addressing the needs of zonal architecture.

One exciting unique aspect of 10BASE-T1S differing from other automotive Ethernet technologies is the support for a multidrop topology with all the nodes connected over the same unshielded twisted pair cable. This bus implementation provides an optimized BOM only requiring a single Ethernet PHY in each node removing the need for a switch or star topology implementation associated with other Ethernet technologies. The standard specifies that at least eight nodes must be supported (it is possible to support many more) and bus lengths of up to 25 m must be possible.

Figure 2. 10BASE-T1S bus topology.

One other new aspect of the standard is physical layer collision avoidance (PLCA) which as the name suggests avoids collision on the shared network. This implementation ensures deterministic maximum latency dictated mainly by the number of nodes on the network and the amount of data to be transmitted. Each node is assigned an opportunity to transmit. If a node has no data to transmit at the time it hands over the transmit opportunity to the next node thereby supporting very high utilization of the 10 Mbps available.

Power over a 10BASE-T1S network is also possible given the fact it is an AC-coupled system. This provides further cable saving reduced connector sizes and improved reliability resulting from reduced cable and connector complexity. Standardization of power over data lines (PoDL)‚Äîwhich is already available for point-to-point implementations‚Äîis ongoing as part of the enhancements to IEEE standards to support the multidrop topology.

Applications for 10BASE-T1S in automotive are broad and varied with many sensors and actuators across multiple functions in body domain comfort infotainment and ADAS under discussion.

Conclusion

The automotive E/E architecture is undergoing a revolutionary change. The transition to zonal E/E architectures is imminent. 10BASE-T1S provides the missing link to support this transition with optimized Ethernet to the edge connectivity. There are still hurdles to overcome in this rollout such as the perception that Ethernet connectivity adds component cost and complexity to module implementations. 10BASE-T1S directly addresses these concerns by providing reduced system cost and a variety of product options that support different kinds of signal chain partitioning. Analog Devices is actively engaged in driving the rollout of 10BASE-T1S through active participation in standardization activities and close OEM engagements to ensure their system requirements are addressed.

Applied Materials (AMAT 1.17%) and ASML (ASML -0.69%) are the two largest semiconductor equipment makers in the world. Applied Materials is an American company that provides a wide range of equipment software and services used to manufacture semiconductors display panels and solar products.

ASML is a Dutch producer of photolithography systems which are used to etch circuit patterns into silicon wafers. It's also the only producer of EUV (extreme ultraviolet) photolithography systems which are required to manufacture the world's smallest and densest chips.

Applied Materials and ASML don't compete against each other but they've both profited from the skyrocketing demand for chips worldwide. But over the past several months shares of Applied Materials and ASML have both pulled back about 35% from their all-time highs.

Those declines were largely caused by concerns about a slowdown in the broader semiconductor market but rising interest rates and other macro headwinds are exacerbating that pressure. So should investors take the contrarian view and invest in either linchpin of the semiconductor market today?

Applied Materials faces a near-term slowdown

Applied Materials suffered a slowdown in 2019 as a cyclical downturn in smartphone sales caused the memory chip market to stall out. Soft sales of TVs also throttled the growth of its display-oriented businesses. However its growth subsequently accelerated over the following two years as new 5G phones and OLED devices hit the market. Stay-at-home trends throughout the pandemic also generated strong tailwinds for the PC data center and smart TV markets.

As a result Applied Materials' revenue and adjusted earnings grew 18% and 37% respectively in fiscal 2020 (which ended in October of the calendar year) while its adjusted gross margin expanded from 44% to 45.1%. In fiscal 2021 its revenue and adjusted EPS rose 34% and 64% respectively as its adjusted gross margin expanded again to 47.5%.

But in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 Applied Materials' revenue only grew 12% year over year to $19.0 billion. Its adjusted gross margin fell 40 basis points to 46.8% and its adjusted EPS increased just 16%. For the full year it expects its revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 11% and 3% respectively.

It blames that deceleration on supply chain constraints instead of a cyclical slowdown and says its backlog continues to grow as the market's demand for its products outstrips its available supply.

ASML faces the same challenges

ASML also suffered a slowdown in 2019 as it struggled with the same smartphone and memory-related headwinds as Applied Materials. But it quickly overcame those challenges as the world's top foundries -- including TSMC Samsung and Intel -- lined up to buy and install new EUV systems to manufacture smaller and denser chips.

As the world's only producer of EUV systems -- which cost about $200 million each and require several planes to ship -- ASML held the golden tickets to winning the ""process race"" between those top foundries. That monopoly also gave it a lot more pricing power than other equipment makers.

That's why the past two years were so kind to ASML. In 2020 ASML's revenue rose 18% its gross margin jumped from 44.7% to 48.6% and its EPS surged 38%. In 2021 its revenue grew 33% its gross margin rose to 52.7% and its EPS surged 69%.

But this year ASML expects its revenue to only rise about 10% and for its gross margin to slip to 49% to 50%. Analysts expect its EPS to dip 3%.

Like Applied Materials ASML attributes that slowdown to supply chain constraints instead of softer demand. During its latest conference call CEO Peter Wennink said the market's demand for its systems still ""significantly exceeds"" its supply. It also didn't alter its long-term target of generating 24 billion to 30 billion euros ($30 billion) in revenue by 2025 which implies its revenue could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of up to 13% over the next four years.

Which stock is a better value?

Applied Materials and ASML face many of the same near-term headwinds but they could both recover quickly as the supply chain constraints ease.

Metric (Period) Estimated Revenue Growth (FY 2023) Estimated EPS Growth (FY 2023) Applied Materials 7% 11% ASML 20% 33%

ASML's growth could experience a speedier recovery as it resumes its shipments of current-gen EUV systems and launches next-gen EUV for even smaller nodes. However ASML's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 42 indicates a lot of that growth has already been priced in. Applied Materials only trades at 13 times forward earnings.

Both of these stocks are good long-term investments but I'd still pick ASML over Applied Materials for three simple reasons: It monopolizes a cornerstone technology of the semiconductor sector its business model is simpler and its growth rates are higher.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9hcHBsaWVkLW1hdGVyaWFscy1yZXN1bHRzLXNob3ctYS1zbG93aW5nLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3IvNDMzODAx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Applied Materials Results Show A Slowing Semiconductor Market,"Earnings for Applied Materials as the company looks to a strong 2022 but warns of issues that might show up in 2023 and beyond.

""Leading-edge foundry-logic looks strong with customers battling for leadership and racing to be first to implement major technology inflections (and) ICAPS customers who serve IoT communications auto power and sensor markets are reporting areas of strength and weakness""

Applied Materials revenue is expected to be up 15% for the fiscal year and management currently expects that 2023 demand is likely to decline from 2022 as macro uncertainty and lower demand for memory-based products are expected to weigh on demand. The leading edge foundry logic division continues to look strong on the other. Demand is also expected to increase from the IoT division from communications auto power and sensors markets.

The biggest risk remains the consumer-centric market as demand for PCs and smartphones continues to remain weak. Most semiconductor manufacturers including Samsung Electronics (OTCPK: SSNLF) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) have all reduced their capital spending in recent times.

The company's valuation remains relatively muted considering that the stock is trading at a price-to-earnings of 14x. While the forward earnings are quite cheap at 12x the semiconductor industry's cyclical nature will have investors worried and is likely to keep the stock muted for a while. But the debt to equity remains quite low at 0.47 which is a positive considering the capital expenditure in recent times.

Excess inventory remains an issue through 2023 as new fabs come onto the market. Significant new capacity coming onto the market from various sources is a major factor. According to IDC research ""Overall the semiconductor industry remains on track to deliver another healthy year of growth as the supercycle that began in 2020 continues this year"" said Mario Morales group vice president Semiconductors at IDC. ""The financial and system markets remain narrowly focused on shortages across specific sectors of the supply chain but what is more important to emphasize is how critical semiconductors are to every major system category and semiconductor content growth that remains unabated over the next five to seven years.""

The biggest issue remains the mixed signal the market is sending. Semiconductors have historically gone through a number of cycles where semiconductor stocks have fallen significantly as a result. And once again issues are slowly starting to show up in the industry. Major semiconductor makers have recently warned that another downcycle might be on the way.

Applied Material's operations despite the potential for hiccups remain relatively strong and the company produced an operating cash flow of $1.47 billion for the quarter and returned most of the cash back to investors. Year to date Applied Materials has produced a free cash flow of $4 billion. Operating margins for the business remain healthy at 32% and profit margins have been around 27% which should help the company maintain operational efficiency and remain solvent during a down cycle.

The stock's technical remains strong with the open interest currently standing at 0.98 which would indicate that the market remains relatively neutral on the stock. Meanwhile the RSI-14 remains relatively moderate at around 50 which shows the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.

Overall Applied Materials remains a stock that is likely to be watched by investors closely as almost a canary in the coal mine as we could be heading for a reversal in fortunes for semiconductor makers.",,,,,,,,,

While the furor over dilated cardiomyopathy has calmed the repercussions on dog food ingredient choices remain. Ancient grains as pet food ingredients had already grown in popularity before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced an investigation into correlations among grain-free dog foods and occurrence of the disease. Following FDA‚Äôs announcement ancient grains and other alternatives to corn rice soy and wheat grew yet faster in popularity as ingredient sources.

Although ultimately just a marketing term ancient grains can be considered grains that haven‚Äôt undergone modern breeding or selection. Ancient grain varieties retail characteristics from their ancestors that can make them hardier for farmers while providing nutrients in different proportions than highly bred strains. While often lower in overall production these grains require less water and fertilizer while surviving where GMO corn would wither.

However the problem with DCM resulted from a lack of empirical evidence and published research on the effects of grain-free formulations. Likewise these new yet ancient grains lacked scientific study on their role in pets‚Äô diets. Scientists with the University of Illinois ‚Äì Urbana and the Archer Daniels Midland company set out to determine if ancient grains could be used as healthy ingredients in foods dogs would readily eat.

‚ÄúAncient grains are a prime example of an increasingly popular trend in human and subsequently pet foods‚Äù the researchers wrote in the Journal of Animal Science. ‚ÄúThis is due to the marketing of these ingredients as sustainable gluten- and GMO-free fiber-rich alternatives to common grains. They also have a positive label appeal on pet foods as they become more prevalent in commercial diets and treats despite limited scientific information on their nutritional value and functional properties for dogs and cats.‚Äù

Ancient grains as dog food ingredients experiment

In their experiment ten adult female Beagles ate one of five dog food formulations. The diets included up to 40% rice or one of four ancient grains: amaranth white proso millet quinoa or oat groats. The dogs ate their assigned diets for 10 days then the scientists evaluated their feces and urine for another four days followed by a day for blood samples.

‚ÄúWhen utilized as the main carbohydrate source at relatively high inclusion levels (up to 40%) in extruded adult dog foods ancient grains are well accepted and appropriate for adult dogs with no detrimental effects on stool quality or macronutrient digestibility‚Äù the researchers concluded. ‚ÄúThe dietary inclusion of amaranth and oat groats is specifically beneficial in shifting fermentative end products indicative of a butyrogenic effect. Although oat groats did not significantly impact the postprandial glycemic or insulinemic responses in healthy dogs in this study it can be implied that this ancient grain may benefit obese insulin resistant and/or diabetic dogs. This benefit should be evaluated in future studies.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,

On Monday the company backtracked and apologized for billboards that bore the message ‚ÄúYou know full well a vow of celibacy is not the answer‚Äù juxtaposed against an introduction to ‚Äúthe new Bumble.‚Äù The app launched a brand redesign in April in hopes of reviving user interest which had been lagging.

Women on social media castigated the company for suggesting celibacy isn‚Äôt a valid personal choice. Some online critics read the slogan as reflecting patriarchal notions that women should be willing to have sex with men even if they don‚Äôt want to.

In an apology posted on Instagram Bumble said it is removing ads that it called a mistaken attempt to ‚Äúlean into a community frustrated by modern dating.‚Äù It said the company has long stood up for women and their right to ‚Äúfully exercise personal choice‚Äù but admitted that the ad campaign didn‚Äôt live up to those values and apologized ‚Äúfor the harm it caused.‚Äù

The company also plans donations to the National Domestic Violence Hotline and other organizations to support global efforts to ‚Äúsupport women marginalized communities and those impacted by abuse.‚Äù The company said it will also offer the billboard space to these same organizations for ads of their choice.

Bumble did not respond to inquiries seeking information on how many billboards were involved in the campaign and where they were located. It remains unclear whether the ads also ran in other media.

The dating app company has been going through a rough patch. Its shares have fallen steadily since last July dropping roughly 45% over that time amid concerns over its ability to reach younger users.

Georgia‚Äôs parliament has passed a controversial ‚Äúforeign agents‚Äù bill despite widespread domestic opposition and warnings from the European Union that its enactment would imperil the country‚Äôs chances of joining the bloc.

The new law will require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as ‚Äúagents of foreign influence‚Äù or face crippling fines. Opponents say that the legislation was modeled after similar laws in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society.

Dr. Dorothy Jean Tillman II was only 10 when she became a freshman at the college of Lake County majoring in psychology. In 2020 she earned her Master of Science from Unity College. She was accepted in 2021 when she was 15 into the Doctor of Behavioral Health Management Program at Arizona State University.

Speaking to ""Good Morning America"" Tillman said she has always held education in such high regard in part due to her family's background.

""People in my life like my grandmother who was part of the Civil Rights Movement she of course harped on the importance of education and consistently learning something always"" Tillman said.

""But the way I always held education so high on my own aside from being raised that way was finding different things to be educated about it doesn't just have to be all of the subjects that they teach you in school there's so many things in the world to learn about that we wish we knew about"" she said. ""I feel like that urge to learn something new just never didn't exist for me.""

Tillman said growing up she had always felt drawn toward psychology and related fields.

""They've always made me so curious"" she said. ""And so grinding away I could continue to study in that area. With even more that was attached to it. It was just really intriguing to me.""

In December 2023 at 17 Tillman successfully defended her dissertation to earn her doctoral degree in integrated behavioral health from ASU's College of Health Solutions. On May 6 she walked at ASU's commencement ceremonies.

Tillman told ""GMA"" prior to the big day that she was feeling ""so excited"" just like any other student.

""I love having a reason to celebrate and throw a big soir√©e"" she said. ""Just that walk and especially with people I haven't been there seeing every day since my program is online it's just gonna feel really fulfilling to finish.""

Dr. Leslie Manson a clinical associate professor at ASU told ""GMA"" that Tillman is the youngest person in school history to earn a doctoral degree in integrated behavioral health.

""It's a wonderful celebration and we hope ... that Dorothy Jean inspires more students"" Manson said adding of Tillman ""But this is still something so rare and unique.""

Throughout Tillman's time at ASU Mason said she saw her growth in gaining the skills of professional writing as well as leadership noting that Tillman is ""inquisitive"" and ""intelligent.""

""She has innovative ideas and motivation which is wonderful"" Mason explained. ""And truly I think what is inspiring is that she embodies that meaning of being a true leader.""

Mason added that ""other students can really learn the piece of dedication"" from Tillman.

""So that motivating energy those are the pieces that I think other folks can really turn to and feel inspired about"" she said. ""That curiosity is always there. And I think all learners come with that. But it's great to be able to see it in someone so young as well.""

Her inspiration and how she gives back to community

Tillman's journey to success wouldn't be made possible without the support from her mom whom she said is one of her biggest motivators.

""Seeing my mother consistently worked so hard to continuously uphold our family's legacy and be that person that everyone was able to go to if they needed anything... Always seeing [her] like [a] 'Wonder Woman' definitely made me want to grow up [into] an accomplished person"" she said.

An advocate for education Tillman is also the founder and CEO of the Dorothyjeanius STEAM Leadership Institute where she runs programs like summer camps to help kids find balance between arts and STEM subjects.

""I feel like adding art and putting a focus on it throughout science technology engineering and math makes the kids excited to learn all those things"" she said. ""And it opens them up to all of the possibilities and all the knowledge provided in that area of just STEM.""

As for her plans after graduation Tillman said she is ""just like any other teenager still figuring out what my specific dreams and goals are.""

""And I'm really just grateful that the world is my oyster and that I've done so much so young. And I have time to like kind of think that through"" she said.

Discussing her advice to other youngsters Tillman said she would remind them to be careful about being influenced on what they see on social media noting that some posts ""aren't real.""

""There's a lot more to whatever it is than what you're seeing you know and so to always remember that is definitely important"" she said. ""And to always remember that everyone has points in their life where they feel like they're figuring it out‚Ä¶And so figuring things out not knowing what you want isn't a bad thing.

Flocks of Taylor Swift fans had four nights in Paris to enjoy the pop star's illustrious and recently revamped Eras Tour but an incident at one of the shows has left people shaken and disturbed.

Photographs have circulated online which illustrate a puzzling scene: an infant on the floor of the pit section at Paris La Defense Arena. It appears the baby is not directly on the hard floor but rather on articles of clothing. A person can be seen standing over the child although it's unclear if that is their parent or guardian.

The ""Bad Blood"" singer's merchandise and wrist bands are also visible in the pictures. It's unclear what evening this took place.

TAYLOR SWIFT'S ERAS TOUR LEAVES US AFTER MONTHS OF MAKING HISTORY AND CAUSING CHAOS

Taylor Swift performed four shows at the Par√≠s La D√©fense Arena.

Social media users voiced their outrage on X formerly Twitter ripping whomever brought the child to a Swift concert.

""You belong in a jail cell for bringing your baby on the floor of a taylor swift concert. the lack of common sense is astonishing to me.""

""Who the F brings a baby to a concert?""

""Whoever left that baby on the floor of the pit of the Taylor Swift concert needs to have their child taken off them.""

""That‚Äôs behavior that should warrant CPS removing the child from the home I feel. If there would‚Äôve been a crowd surge when the lights dropped that baby would‚Äôve been a pancake. Because people at a concert aren‚Äôt watching for a literal BABY ON THE FLOOR.""

""Anything could happen a medical emergency could happen someone drunk might have hurt the baby someone could have accidentally stepped on the baby I can imagine it‚Äôs difficult to pay attention to your child lying on the floor when you‚Äôre watching a 3 1/2 hour concert too.""

Fans of Swift were quick to defend themselves and the singer saying one person's poor decision wasn't indicative of how the fans as a whole behaved.

""It wasn‚Äôt the whole fandom that brought that child it was the parents. instead of calling out ‚Äòswifties‚Äô maybe call out the parents that brought the baby to the concert and put them on the floor in the extremely crowded pit.""

""This is not about artists or fanbases in anyway. this is ridiculous and so f‚Äîing dangerous. how irresponsible do u have to be to take a baby to a concert and put it on the floor in ga ???!!

""... that's not Taylor's fault that's the fault if the irresponsible mother who brought the baby to the stupid concert.""

Taylor Swift fans defended themselves from people suggesting Swifties were the problem.

When reached for comment by Fox News Digital a communications officer at Paris La Defense Arena clarified the venues' standards.

""Paris La Defense Arena general terms and conditions of sale stipulate that all minors (without any age limit) holding a ticket for a concert at Paris La D√©fense arena must be accompanied by an adult. Under 18 children remain under their legal guardian responsibility it‚Äôs venue policy. For spectators with a young child in the floor an alternative seating arrangement has been proposed but refused by ticket holders.""

A representative for Swift did not immediately provide Fox News Digital with comment about the incident.

Taylor Swift had the support of her boyfriend Travis Kelce during her final Paris show.

For her last show in Paris Swift had the support of her boyfriend Travis Kelce along with good friend Gigi Hadid and her boyfriend Bradley Cooper who were all seen dancing and enjoying the atmosphere.

Digital construction will become more important than ever as organisations from owners to subcontractors are required to record and maintain detailed information on every project.

While the changes will be positive for the industry it‚Äôs not unusual to be concerned about the cost time and complexity of meeting the new requirements.

Here we share a simple checklist to help with getting ready for the Building Safety Bill and putting the technology you need in place.

We‚Äôve collaborated with industry experts to create a white paper How to prepare for the Building Safety Bill.Download it for free here.

Understand your organisation‚Äôs obligations at each Gateway stage

The Building Safety Bill will create new obligations for owners of existing high-rise residential buildings and every collaborator involved in new projects. At each stage from planning to construction and occupation there are requirements that must be met before work continues as part of the new Gateway system.

So the first step in preparing for the bill is understanding your organisation‚Äôs obligations at each stage whether that‚Äôs subcontractors providing evidence of competence or owners getting approvals for any design changes.

Overall everyone will need to contribute to the golden thread of information ‚Äì a digital record of all the information on a building including its construction making technology important.

Review your digital infrastructure and get the basics in place

Assessing how technology is already used in your organisation is a valuable next step. It‚Äôs common for digital tools to be used on an ad hoc basis ‚Äì with different teams taking different approaches or working project by project.

Getting the basics right is critical and creating a simpler more consistent approach will pay dividends. Look at how information is collected and stored right down to data standards and naming conventions used and think about how you can establish more uniformity from team to team.

Part of the answer will be avoiding too many different standalone technologies often referred to as point solutions. Consider consolidating what you have and looking at your long-term goals. Working with a technology partner could help you to identify how you can simplify what you already have.

Focus on getting your information management right

Data management will be central to meeting the requirements of the Building Safety Bill. All collaborators on a project from designers to contractors will need to maintain a local electronic audit trail rather than relying on owners to hold the data. It will also be important to be able to easily access and share information whenever required.

Ensuring your information management is up to scratch will be key for every organisation. Building Information Modelling (BIM) based workflows are likely to be valuable because this enables all stakeholders to access the same data in real-time.

A common data environment may also be worth considering as a secure accessible place to store building data with approval controls and audit trails.

Think about the interoperability of your digital tools

Organisations have a wide range of choice over the digital tools used given that the legislation doesn‚Äôt specify a particular software or tool. But a key consideration is interoperability ‚Äì between different teams and different companies.

Throughout projects information from these stakeholders will need to be shared and collated into the golden thread of information. Using data platforms that easily integrate with others will be important to ensure that data records can be linked together.

Owners might specify open standards such as buildingSMART's IFC to ensure all the information received is easy to access and use throughout a building‚Äôs lifespan.

Don‚Äôt discount the wider benefits of technology investments

Both digital tools and information can hold lots of advantages for organisations. Technology can improve outcomes like efficiency quality and sustainability as well as strengthening relationships with other stakeholders and clients.

With that in mind it‚Äôs important to think about digital tools not only as a way to meet the requirements of the Building Safety Bill but as a long-term resource for the organisation. There might be advantages that help to deliver return on your investment or even offset the initial costs.

With many digital platforms it will also be possible to add higher value functions over time ‚Äì which could be anything from automated take off tools to digital twins. Bear in mind how technology could serve your organisation‚Äôs broader ambitions as well as your short-term compliance needs.

Have a plan for your people

The success of any new technology or process depends on getting people onside so it‚Äôs important to have a plan for bringing your team along for the journey. Encouraging everyone to understand the basics of digital construction and why it‚Äôs important can help.

Use champions to advocate for change around the business. Create a safe environment for people to learn and ask questions ‚Äì and ensure you choose digital tools that are easy to understand and use either from the office home or on-site.

Ultimately it can be reassuring to remember that virtually everyone uses technology a lot in their day-to-day life without extensive training courses. In the right environment people can adapt very quickly and a more digitally confident workforce will set your organisation up for the future.

Learn from organisations that have been there

Even relative newcomers to digital transformation can take significant steps forward by looking at what other companies have done. Speak to your peers and collaborators; for example subcontractors could reach out to main contractors to learn from their experiences. Technology partners can also help you to explore the options available.

You might worry you‚Äôre starting late ‚Äì but there are plenty of tried and tested approaches out there. By learning from others you can avoid pitfalls and mistakes and gain the benefits of digital investments all the sooner.

These data were obtained from 25 patients with epilepsy (13 males and 12 females aged 39.6 ¬± 16.8 years) during presurgical monitoring over several days at Universit√§tsklinikum Freiburg. Data were acquired using a sampling rate of 256 Hz and 19 electrodes organised according to the 10‚Äì20 international system29. Information about the access of the EPILEPSIAE database can be found on: http://epilepsy-database.eu/. Details about the process of licensing and financial contribution to maintain the database can be requested via the e-mail address provided on the web site.

Data were curated in the context of epileptic seizure prediction. To develop our seizure prediction models we considered data ranging from 4.5 hours before the beginning of the leading seizure30 until its onset. This selection was performed considering that EEG data within this interval contain both normal and pre-seizure brain states3132. Data were collected over several days (accounting for 684 hours of EEG signal). Typical activities were captured in the signals such as conversation eating drinking washing and sleeping. Therefore it may contain several experimental errors such as poor electrode connection and adhesion issues which must be minimised before performing independent component analysis (ICA). In the next section we present the algorithm used to remove experimental errors. Subsequently in section Independent Components Classification we describe how the manual labelling of the independent components (ICs) was performed. It should be noted that both steps were also conducted in a previous study to prepare EEG data in order to train deep convolutional neural networks to automatically remove artifacts from EEG data14.

Removal of experimental errors

We developed an algorithm to identify and remove data corrupted by experimental errors. Figure 1 provides a diagram explaining it. The methods used in the algorithm are ordered by the simplest to the most complex one. Therefore it consists in frequency filtering identification and removal of flatlines and constant saturated portions in all channels identification and removal of abnormal peaks EEG segmentation removal of noisy EEG segments removal of electrode pops and interpolation of noisy EEG channels preparation for ICA and ICA processing.

Fig. 1 Framework followed to obtain the independent components for each EEG segment. It covers the following steps: extraction of signals from EPILEPSIAE database; identification and removal of flatlines constant saturated portions and abnormal peaks; EEG segmentation; removal of noisy EEG segments; removal of electrode pops; and interpolation of noisy EEG channels and preparation for ICA. Full size image

Frequency filtering

The algorithm filtered the data using a 0.5‚Äì100 Hz bandpass 4th-order Butterworth filter and a 50 Hz 2nd-order notch filter with the purpose of removing the DC component high-frequency noise and the powerline interference.

Identification and removal of flatlines and constant saturated portions in all channels

Since the data were collected over several days including day-to-day activities these contained several experimental errors. Our algorithm identified and removed every portion of the signal which contained isoelectric flatlines (see Fig. 2) or constant saturated segments (see Fig. 3) as well as the 10 seconds of data before and after these errors. These errors were removed for all channels simultaneously.

Fig. 2 Example of an EEG signal with a flat segment. The selected portion was removed over all channels. Full size image

Fig. 3 Example of an EEG signal containing a saturated segment. The selected portion was removed over all channels. Full size image

Identification and removal of abnormal peaks

After the removal of flat and constant segments the algorithm identified portions of the signal below ‚àí5 mV and above 5 mV which we named abnormal peaks for easier comprehension (see Fig. 4). Then the algorithm verified whether the peaks happened in the channels Fp1 Fp2 O1 O2 T5 T6 and Cz at the same time. These electrodes were selected according to their geometrical positions which means that if an abrupt movement affected the system all of them should capture it. If abnormal peaks appeared in all the aforementioned electrodes every sample from 10 seconds before the beginning of the peak until 10 seconds after the peak was removed. It is worth noting that in order to keep the temporal coherence of the signals we did not concatenated the data after removing artifacts (see Fig. 5).

Fig. 4 Example of an EEG signal with several abnormal peaks. As these artifacts appeared in Fp1 Fp2 T7 T8 O1 O2 and Cz the selected EEG portion was removed across all channels. Full size image

Fig. 5 Example of a preprocessed EEG signal. The EEG segments were not concatenated after removing noisy data. Full size image

EEG segmentation

The algorithm divided the remaining data in 10-minute segments (see Fig. 6). The segmentation in 10-minute portions was performed to prepare the data for the ICA2224. As the signals were not concatenated after removing errors there might be segments lasting less than 10 minutes. Despite lasting less than 10 minutes these segments were kept to obtain the largest possible dataset. The algorithm removed every segment lasting less than 10 seconds as these did not comprise enough data to be properly processed by ICA.

Fig. 6 Example of a preprocessed EEG signal divided into 10-minute segments. Dashed and continuous lines determine the beginning and the end of the 10-minute segments respectively. The last segment contains samples from the previous one because the duration of the subsignal is not divisible by 10. Full size image

Removal of noisy eeg segments

After the EEG segmentation the algorithm still could identify abnormal peaks which remained in the EEG channels. If more than 20% of the EEG channel would be removed as a consequence of having abnormal peaks then the channel was marked to be interpolated. The segment is rejected if more than two EEG channels were marked for interpolation (>10% of all EEG channels).

Removal of electrode pops

At this point the algorithm divided the segments into 5-second windows with a 50% overlap. After that the algorithm filtered the windows using a 5 Hz low-pass filter. It is worth noting that to not alter the values of the windows when filtering we saved the original values before performing the analysis. Finally the algorithm identified filtered windows with an amplitude higher than 0.5 mV in order to find electrode pops that were not previously removed (see Fig. 7). In case at most 10% of channels (two channels) contained electrode pops the original window was interpolated. Otherwise it was maintained. It is worth noting that this method was not considered at the beginning of our preprocessing methodology. However after analysing some ICs we noticed that some segments contained one IC only for the electrode pops. Therefore we added this step to reduce those outputs.

Fig. 7 Example of EEG segment with an electrode pop present in channel F7. Full size image

Interpolation of noisy EEG channels preparation for ICA and ICA processing

Finally the channels selected to be interpolated in the phase Removal of Noisy EEG Segments were interpolated using the spherical interpolation method33 available in EEGLAB toolbox34. Finally all segments were re-referenced to the average reference and decomposed by extended infomax ICA algorithm35.

From the original 648 hours of signal 35.32 hours were removed by the algorithm due to experimental errors. Therefore the dataset is based on 612.68 hours of EEG data.

Independent components classification

The 612.68 hours of EEG data comprise 77426 ICs. These data were randomly split into training and test sets. The training set contains 61092 (78.86%) ICs from 20 patients whereas the test set contains 16334 (21.14%) ICs from the remaining 5 patients. Two experts visually inspected these segments. This analysis was performed following a semi-supervised approach using the ICLabel toolbox12 available in the EEGLAB34. The ICs were first automatically classified by the ICLabel classifier as brain component or artifact and then corrected by the experts when needed. To make the corrections they verified the IC time-series power spectrum density (PSD) and topographic map of each IC. If they did not agree with the ICLabel classification they would change it according to their analysis. Figure 8 presents some examples of analysed ICs. ICs presented in Fig. 8a‚Äìc predominantly present artifacts. Figure 8d shows an IC with brain information manifesting (i) on the dipole showing in the topoplot and (ii) on the alpha-band peak showing in the PSD spectrum. Figure 8ef present ICs containing both brain and noisy data. Despite the existence of noise experts classified both components as brain in order to maintain neural information that could still be useful in further analysis.

Training and test sets were differently analysed. Each IC of the training set was only inspected by one expert i.e. if one expert already analysed one IC it was not examined by the other expert. This analysis method was performed to have a dataset classified following different opinions especially on the doubtful ICs. Training set contains 43038 (70.44%) brain ICs and 18054 (29.56%) artifact ICs. Concerning the test set it was firstly reviewed by both experts independently and finally the ICs with different classifications were discussed by them to assign a final classification. This approach was made to have a test set validated by both experts with the minimum possible subjectivity. Test set contains 11437 (70.02%) brain ICs and 4897 (29.98%) artifact ICs.

After all the processing methods we extracted the time-series PSDs and topographic maps of all ICs. IC time-series were obtained from the multiplication of the ICA weights with the EEG data. Depending on how long they are these may contain from 2560 to 153600 samples. The IC PSDs were obtained using the spectopo function available in the EEGLAB toolbox. These were restricted to frequencies between 1 and 90 Hz in order to reject the effects of the used 0.5‚Äì100 Hz band-pass filter. The IC topographic maps were obtained using the topoplot function available in the EEGLAB toolbox. These comprise 67 √ó 67 pixels. Both PSD and topographic maps were normalised using the maximum and minimum values. The IC time-series were not normalised because experts reported that the amplitude of the data was used to decide if the IC should be removed in doubtful cases.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2F1dG9tYXRpb24vdGhlLWVtZXJnZW5jZS1vZi10aGUtY2hpZWYtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1vZmZpY2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The emergence of the chief automation officer,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/automation/the-emergence-of-the-chief-automation-officer/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2F1dG9tYXRpb24vdGhlLWVtZXJnZW5jZS1vZi10aGUtY2hpZWYtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1vZmZpY2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vaGFja2Vybm9vbi5jb20vc2VuZC1nb29nbGUtZm9ybXMtcmVzcG9uc2VzLWluLWFuLWVtYWlsLWF1dG9tYXRpY2FsbHktdXNpbmctZ29vZ2xlLWFwcHMtc2NyaXB00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Send Google Forms Responses in an Email Automatically Using Google Apps Script,"1236 reads

To test our pipeline we chose contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) angiograms of patients being followed up after endovascular repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) as the stented aorta is an example of a solid lesion that requires serial follow-up with cross-sectional imaging. We chose post-EVAR CTs because serial comparison of scans is a common diagnostic problem which can be time-consuming and labour intensive. The choice was also due in part with familiarity (three authors are vascular interventionists) and to the fact that our group had previously used and tested a reproducible manual segmentation technique on these scans1112. CTs were performed with a 64-slice Siemens Somatom scanner (Siemens Healthcare Frimley UK). Manual segmentation was performed by one of the authors (MH) on reconstructed 2 mm thick slices with intervals of 2 mm according to a previously described technique111213.

We acquired a total of 70 fully anonymised postoperative CTs of which 50 were manually segmented to provide a ‚Äúground truth‚Äù for training the deep learning algorithm and to provide useful evaluation metrics. The manual segmentation (‚Äúground truth labelling‚Äù) was conducted between the lowermost renal artery and the aortic bifurcation by hand using an open source application called ITK-SNAP14. This segmentation was considered the reference standard.

We used a typical 60:20:20 ratio for training validation and testing the images: 30 sets to train the deep learning part 10 sets to validate and prevent overfitting and reserved the final 10 sets for evaluation purposes. Our pipeline also used 20 unlabelled datasets during the training phase providing us with 50 volumes in total during training.

Additionally we evaluated the pipeline on two publicly available datasets: The Brain Tumour Segmentation challenge (BraTS)151617 and the Abdomen data from the Multi-Atlas Labelling Beyond the Cranial Vault challenge18. The BraTS dataset contains a range of MR modalities but for our purposes we considered only the fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) volumes. All sets have been labelled by one to four raters following the same protocol and their annotations approved by experienced neuro-radiologists. We segmented only the tumour region in each volume. We used a total of 200 volumes for the BraTS data: 120 during training 40 for validation and 40 for evaluation purposes. In addition to the BraTS we used the Abdomen dataset a collection of CT scans of the abdomen in which 13 organs have been segmented by two experienced undergraduate students and the segmentation verified by a radiologist. We evaluated our pipeline on five of the 13 organs: the spleen the right kidney the left kidney the liver and the aorta. The Abdomen dataset contains 30 scans; of these we used 15 for training 5 for validation and 10 for evaluation.

Pipeline tests

After windowing and selecting the uppermost and lowermost slice for segmentation on either a post-EVAR aneurysm or a selected organ from the BraTS or Abdomen datasets we ran our variational model10. This original model uses an enhanced method of edge detection which allows for images containing low contrast to be segmented effectively. Following edge detection the region of interest is segmented based on image intensity and pixel location in the image10. The variational method provided us with a good but not perfect initial segmentation as some regions may contain no contrast at the boundary. Furthermore artifacts may result in poor definition in certain areas.

Although it is possible to obtain accurate segmentation by using the variational method only this is a time-consuming process taking up to 20 min for a large volume. Further each new volume would require a user to manually insert a set of markers to indicate the region of interest. We eliminated this step entirely by using image registration. In practice we ran the variational segmentation model for one 3D volume (aneurysm tumour or organ) obtaining an initial segmentation. For each subsequent scan we simply superimposed this segmentation to the new scan thereby registering the saved segmentation onto the new image rather than re-running the variational method on each new image. The overlapped images were then registered by a previously trained network19 which although not entirely accurate produced an estimate that could be fed to the CNN to produce an accurate final result. This image with the initial segmentation was not excluded and maintained a place in the training set. This registration step removed the need for user interaction making the method automatic.

The final stage involved feeding each estimated segmented volume to the CNN. Unlike in commonly used methods of segmentations by CNNs46 ours received both the scan and the estimated segmented volume (the output of the variational model). This provided the CNN with supplementary information to produce an accurate final result. The CNN was trained in a standard way using backpropagation (see appendix for details).

‚ÄúUnlabelled‚Äù scans (i.e. image volumes without manual segmentation) were also used to train our pipeline. The estimated volume from the variational method was used here in place of the reference standard. This allowed us to expand our training set exposing the network to more data without needing more time-consuming manual labeling. This is commonly known as a semi-supervised approach to learning (see appendix).

Data analysis and presentation

The accuracy of an automated segmentation pipeline depends on its ability to correctly identify all voxels hence volume belonging to an organ/lesion in a scan as well as those that lie outside said organ/lesion. To evaluate the accuracy of our pipeline against manual segmentation we reported true positives (TP) as the number of voxels correctly identified by a segmentation method; false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) as the number of voxels incorrectly identified/excluded by a segmentation method; sensitivity as the ability of a model to correctly identify all relevant voxels or volume and false negative rate (the inverse of sensitivity). We did not report true negatives as these are largely dependent on the total number of voxels included in a scan (usually a whole section of the body) hence values are always very high. Continuous variables were expressed as median and range as they were generally not normally distributed. Correlation was evaluated by graphical methods and agreement with Bland‚ÄìAltman plots20.

We also used more commonly used segmentation metrics to evaluate the pipeline including the DICE the JACCARD and the volumetric similarity (VS) coefficients which are defined as:

$$\begin{aligned} DICE = \frac{2 TP}{2 TP + FP + FN} \quad JACCARD = \frac{TP}{TP + FP+ FN} \quad VS = 1 - \frac{ |FN - FP| }{ 2 TP + FP + FN}. \end{aligned}$$

Finally the Hausdorff Distance (HD) between a segmented volume X and a ground truth segmentation GT is defined as:

$$\begin{aligned} HD(XGT) = \max \big ( h(XGT) h(GTX) \big ) \end{aligned}$$

where h(X GT) is the directed Hausdorff distance given by:

$$\begin{aligned} h(XGT) = \max _{x \in X} \min _{y \in GT} | x - y | \end{aligned}$$

where \(|x-y|\) is the Euclidean distance between two points where x is in X and y is in GT.

Both DICE and JACCARD scores range between 0 (where no overlap between output and reference occurs) and 1 (where the output is exactly the reference segmentation). VS represents how similar the volume of the segmented output is to the volume of the reference segmentation. This is not influenced by the overlap: two organs with the exact same volume but in different positions would result in a VS score of 1. Finally HD describes the largest distance from one volume to the nearest point in the other. Unlike the other metrics described here the ideal result of HD is a score of 0 as the voxels of an ideal segmentation would be in the same place as those of the reference standard.

In order to compare our pipeline to a more traditional method of automated segmentation we trained a deep learning model in a typical fashion (using only the scan as input without the input of our variational model). This method is referred as ‚Äústandard‚Äù in our results.

As further experiments we trained the hybrid method with a decreasing number of data in the training set in order to determine if the hybrid approach can perform better than the standard method when provided with less data. In addition we run the hybrid method on some simplified networks with lighter architectures (see appendix).

MultiNODEs represent an extension of the original NODEs framework14 that overcomes the limitations of its predecessor such that an application to incomplete datasets consisting of both static and time-dependent variables becomes feasible. Conceptually MultiNODEs build on three key components (Fig. 1): (1) latent NODEs (2) a variational autoencoder (more specifically a Heterogenous Incomplete Variational Autoencoder [HI-VAE] designed to handle multimodal data with missing values17) and (3) an implicit imputation layer18. The latent NODEs enable the learning and subsequent generation of continuous longitudinal variable trajectories. The longitudinal properties of the initial condition (i.e. the starting point for the ODE system solver of the latent NODEs) are defined by the output of a recurrent variational encoder that embeds the longitudinal input data into a latent space (Fig. 1 orange box). To allow for an additional influence of static variables on the estimation of the longitudinal variable trajectories the second component a HI-VAE is introduced (Fig. 1 blue box). This component transforms the static information into a distinct latent space and the resulting embedding is used to augment the latent starting condition of the NODEs by concatenating the static variable embedding and the latent representation of the longitudinal variables (Fig. 1 ‚Äúaugmentation‚Äù). The HI-VAE component itself holds generative properties and conducts the synthesis of the static variables when MultiNODEs are applied in a generative setting. Conclusively MultiNODEs integrate static variables (e.g. biological sex or genotype information) both to inform the learning of longitudinal trajectories and in the generative process. Finally to mitigate the original NODEs‚Äô incapability of dealing with missing values we introduced the imputation layer which implicitly replaces missing values during model training with learned estimates (Fig. 1 green box). For further details on the model architecture training and hyperparameter optimization we refer to the Method section and Supplementary material respectively.

Synthetic data generation using MultiNODEs

Generating synthetic data using MultiNODEs starts by randomly sampling a latent representation for both the static and longitudinal variables respectively. The longitudinal variables in data space are then generated by first constructing the initial conditions of the latent ODE system (i.e. concatenating the static latent representation to the longitudinal one) followed by solving the ODE system given these initial conditions and finally by decoding the result into data space. The static variables are generated by directly transforming their sampled latent representation into data space using the HI-VAE decoder.

MultiNODEs support two different approaches for the initial sampling of the latent representations namely sampling from the prior distribution employed during model training and sampling from the learned posterior distribution of the input data.

During the posterior sampling procedure the reparameterization trick19 is applied to draw a latent representation from the posterior distribution learned from the training data. The amount of noise added in this process can be tuned whereas greater noise will lead to a wider spread of the generated marginal distributions of the synthetic data. Alternatively the latent representations can be sampled from the prior distributions imposed on the latent space during variational model training. We ensure statistical dependence between static and longitudinal variables by drawing their values from a Bayesian network that connects both latent representations such that the longitudinal variables are conditionally dependent on the static variables. More detailed descriptions of both generation procedures are provided in the Method section.

Application cases: Parkinson‚Äôs disease and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease

We applied MultiNODEs to longitudinal multimodal data from two independent clinical datasets with the goal of generating realistic synthetic datasets that maintain the real data properties. Details about the data preprocessing steps are described in the Supplementary material.

The first dataset was the PPMI an observational clinical study containing 354 de-novo PD patients who participated in a range of clinical neurological and demographic assessments which form the variables of the dataset. In total a set of 25 longitudinal and 43 static variables was investigated.

Furthermore as a second example we applied MultiNODEs to longitudinal multimodal data from the NACC. NACC is a database storing patient-level AD data collected across multiple memory clinics. After preprocessing the dataset used in this study contained 2284 patients and a set of three longitudinal and four static variables was investigated.

In the following sections we will focus on the results achieved on the PPMI data and refer to the equivalent experiments based on the NACC data that are presented in the Supplementary material.

MultiNODEs generate realistic synthetic patient-level datasets

We applied prior as well as posterior sampling for comparison purposes. With each method we generated the same number of synthetic patients as encountered in the real dataset to allow for a fair comparison. To assess whether the generated data followed the real data characteristics we conducted thorough comparisons of the marginal distributions using qualitative and visual assessments and further quantitatively compared the Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence (JS-divergence) between the generated data and real distributions. The JS-divergence is bound between 0 and 1 with 0 indicating equal distributions. In addition we investigated the underlying correlation structure of the measured variables. Finally we trained a machine learning classifier (Random Forest) that evaluated whether real and synthetic patients showed similar clinical characteristics when compared to real healthy control individuals from their respective studies. Across all these aspects we evaluated MultiNODEs‚Äô performance in comparison to the previously published VAMBN approach4.

The synthetic data generated using MultiNODE generally exhibited marginal distributions that bore high similarity to their corresponding real counterparts (Fig. 2 Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1; equivalent figures for the NACC data are presented in Supplementary Fig. 4). The average JS-divergences between the real and synthetic distributions calculated across all variables and timepoints amounted to 0.018 ¬± 0.015 and 0.011 ¬± 0.009 for the PPMI data generated from the prior and posterior respectively. For NACC the average JS-divergence was 0.071 ¬± 0.055 and 0.029 ¬± 0.031 for prior and posterior sampling respectively. With respect to PPMI data generation from the posterior distribution resulted in synthetic data that resembled the real data significantly closer than those generated from the prior distribution (Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test p < 0.02).

Fig. 2: Marginal distributions of real and synthesized data for multiple variables. Mean standard deviation and KL-divergence for the displayed variables can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Equivalent results for the NACC data are presented in Supplementary Fig. 5. a Time-dependent variable ‚ÄúSCOPA‚Äù at month 12. b Time-dependent variable ‚ÄúUPDRS2‚Äù at month 24. c Static variable ‚ÄúAŒ≤.42‚Äù. d Categorical static variable ‚ÄúHandedness‚Äù. Full size image

Compared to VAMBN the prior sampling method seemed to be inferior with respect to the average JS-divergence when using NACC (U test p = 0.038). However no statistically significant difference in the performance of VAMBN compared to MultiNODE‚Äôs posterior sampling could be observed (U test p = 0.80). For PPMI no significant differences were found between VAMBN and any of MultiNODEs‚Äô generation approaches (U test p = 0.31 for the prior approach; U test p = 0.24 for the posterior).

In order to evaluate whether MultiNODEs learned not only to reproduce univariate distributions but actually captured their interdependencies accurately we compared the correlation structure of the generated data to that of the real variables. Visualizations of the Spearman rank correlation coefficients showed that both the prior and posterior sampling generated synthetic data which successfully reproduced the real variables‚Äô interdependencies (Fig. 3). Comparing the results against VAMBN-generated data revealed that both generation procedures of MultiNODEs were significantly better at reproducing the real data characteristics: the Frobenius norm of real data correlation matrix resulted in 45.3 and with a Frobenius norm of 25.66 the VAMBN-generated data placed substantially further from the real data than the MultiNODEs approaches with 62.63 and 56.47 for the prior and posterior sampling respectively. This shows that MultiNODEs slightly overestimated the present correlations while VAMBN underestimated them. Concordantly the relative error (i.e. the deviation of the respective synthetic dataset‚Äôs correlation matrix from the real one normalized by the norm of the real correlation matrix) was 0.81 0.62 and 0.46 respectively for VAMBN and MultiNODEs‚Äô prior and posterior sampling leaving MultiNODEs with a substantially lower error than the VAMBN approach.

Assessment of the utility of generated synthetic patients for machine learning

To evaluate whether the generated synthetic patients could be reliably used in a machine learning context we built a Random Forest classifier that aimed to distinguish between healthy individuals and diseased patients. The classifier was trained within a five-fold cross-validation scheme once using real and once using synthetic diseased patients. In addition we trained a classifier on each respective synthetic dataset (comprising synthetically generated diseased and healthy subjects) and evaluated their performance on the real data (Table 1). As predictors we used clinical symptoms and genetic markers that are characteristic of the disease in question. For PD (PPMI) these were the UPDRS scores that describe a series of motor and non-motor symptoms commonly encountered in PD patients for AD (NACC) we predominantly used cognitive assessments and a genetic risk factor. Technical details about the classifiers can be found in the Supplementary material. Distinguishing real patients from healthy control subjects was possible with a 10 times repeated five-fold cross-validated performance of 0.97 ¬± 0.02 area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) and 0.90 ¬± 0.01 AUC for PPMI and NACC respectively. On PPMI all evaluated generative methods achieved almost equal performance indicating that clinical characteristics of synthetic patients followed the same patterns as in real patients. In addition the most relevant features were the same across the real and all synthetic data-trained classifiers (Supplementary Fig. 13).

Table 1 Performance (AUC) of machine learning classifiers differentiating between real healthy control subjects and real as well as synthetic patients respectively. Full size table

For NACC some deviations were found between a classifier‚Äôs cross-validated performance on real data and the synthetic-data-based performances. Here MultiNODEs‚Äô posterior and VAMBN showed similar deviations in opposite directions with the posterior slightly overperforming and VAMBN slightly underperforming. The performance on the data generated via MultiNODE‚Äôs prior sampling method deviated the most (Table 1). When trained on synthetic data and evaluated on real data all trained classifiers underperformed compared to classifiers trained on real data. The feature importances of predictors were highly similar between the real data-trained and the respective synthetic data-trained classifiers.

Generating data in continuous time through smooth interpolation and extrapolation

One particular strength of MultiNODEs that sets it apart from alternative approaches such as VAMBN is its ability to model variable trajectories in continuous time. The latent ODE system allows for the estimation of variable trajectories at any arbitrary timepoint and thereby opens possibilities for (1) the generation of smooth trajectories (2) overcoming panel-data limitations through interpolation and finally (3) extrapolation beyond the time span covered in training data themselves. Again we evaluated these capabilities based on the PPMI and NACC datasets (for brevity NACC results are presented in the Supplementary material). For the following we only focused on the MultiNODE posterior sampling approach to generate synthetic subjects.

Comparing the median trajectories of variables from the real data to those generated using MultiNODEs revealed that MultiNODEs accurately learned and reproduced the longitudinal dynamics exhibited in the real data (Fig. 4). Generation from both the prior and posterior distribution led to synthesized median trajectories that closely resembled the real median trajectories. Equivalently also the 97.5% and 2.5% quantiles of the synthetic data approximated the corresponding real quantiles closely indicating a realistic distribution of the synthetic data across the observed timepoints. This observation held true for most of the time-dependent variables (plots for all variables are linked in the Supplementary material).

Fig. 4: Comparison of median trajectories including the 2.5%/97.5% quantiles of longitudinal variables from synthetic and real PPMI data. Additional examples are provided in Supplementary Fig. 2. A corresponding example for the NACC dataset is shown in Supplementary Fig. 7. a‚Äìd depict different longitudinal variables from the PPMI dataset. Full size image

We further assessed the interpolation and extrapolation capabilities of MultiNODEs. For interpolation one timepoint was excluded from model training and subsequently data were generated for all timepoints including the one left-out. Contrasting the interpolated/imputed values against the corresponding real values showed that MultiNODEs accurately reproduced the longitudinal dynamics of a variable even for unobserved timepoints (Fig. 5a c). In this context we further compared the interpolated values against synthetic data that was generated based on the complete real data trajectory. We observed that the mean JS-divergence calculated across all variables between the interpolated data and the real data was slightly higher (0.025 ¬± 0.011) than that of the real data and the synthetic data generated after training MultiNODEs on the complete trajectory (0.016 ¬± 0.011). Similarly the relative error between the interpolated correlation matrix and the real data was again only marginally higher than between the complete data and the real data (0.48 and 0.46 respectively; Supplementary Fig. 4).

Fig. 5: Time-continuous interpolation and extrapolation of exemplary PPMI variables. The black box indicates the interpolated and extrapolated sections. Plots for additional variables are presented in Supplementary Fig. 3. A corresponding example for the NACC dataset is shown in Supplementary Fig. 8. a Interpolation of the UPDRS1 variable at month 24. b Extrapolation of the last five assessments of the UPDRS1 variable. c Distribution of the interpolated values for UPDRS1 at visit 24. d Distribution of the extrapolated values for UPDRS1 at month 42. Full size image

In order to test MultiNODEs‚Äô extrapolation capabilities only the first 24 months of assessment follow-up and the static variables were used during model training. The trained model was then applied to generate data for the remaining left-out timepoints of the longitudinal variables. In this course 77 values were extrapolated while not every variable had the same number of follow-up assessments after month 24. Comparing the extrapolated synthetic data to the left-out real data demonstrated reliable extrapolation beyond the training data (Fig. 5b d). As in the interpolation setting we also compared the average JS-divergence between the extrapolated data and the real data with that between the real data and synthetic data that were generated after training MultiNODEs on the complete trajectory. As expected we could see a larger difference between the JS-divergences compared to the interpolation setting with 0.037 ¬± 0.024 for the extrapolated data and 0.016 ¬± 0.009 for the synthetic data based on the complete trajectory. The correlation structure in the extrapolation culminated in a relative error of 0.64 compared to 0.46 when using the complete trajectory for training MultiNODEs (Supplementary Fig. 4).

In addition the marginal distributions at both the interpolated and extrapolated timepoints also followed those of the real data (Fig. 5c d).

Systematic model benchmarking on simulated data

To explore the learning properties of MultiNODEs more systematically we investigated how alternating training conditions with respect to measurement frequency sample size and noisiness of the data influence MultiNODEs‚Äô generative performance.

The benchmarking data was simulated via the well-established Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model that is often used to describe the spread of infectious diseases and follows a highly nonlinear structure: Let S(t) be the number of susceptible individuals at a timepoint t I(t) be the number of infectious individuals at a timepoint t and R(t) be the number of removed or recovered individuals at a timepoint t. With Œ≤ as transmission rate Œ≥ as mean recovery/death rate and N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) as fixed population size the SIR model can be defined by the ODE system presented in Eq. (1):

$$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\frac{{dS}}{{dt}} = \frac{{ - \beta SI}}{N}} \\ {\frac{{dI}}{{dt}} = \frac{{\beta SI}}{N} - \gamma I} \\ {\frac{{dR}}{{dt}} = \gamma I} \end{array}$$ (1)

Details about the SIR parameter settings are described in the Supplementary material.

As baseline settings for each investigation we simulated 1000 data points with 10 equidistant assessment timepoints each distributed over a span of 40 time intervals and added 5% Gaussian noise to each measurement. That means we added a normally distributed variable with the standard deviation set to 5% of the theoretical range of each of the variables S(t) I(t) and R(t). During the benchmarking we individually alternated the sample size timepoints and noise level. For the timepoint investigation we compared MultiNODEs trained on 5 10 and 100 equidistant assessments; for the sample size we considered 100 1000 and 5000 samples; and for the noise level we tested 50% 75% and 100% of the maximum encountered value added as noise.

Alternating the amount of equidistant longitudinal timepoints exposed a strong dependency of MultiNODEs on the longitudinal coverage of the time-dependent process (Fig. 6a). While the general trends in the data were appropriately learned for all explored assessment frequencies the position of the observations in time influenced how close the learned function approximated the true data-underlying process. Especially the peak of the ‚ÄúInfected‚Äù-function represented a challenge for MultiNODEs if no data point was located close to it (Fig. 6a ‚ÄúInfected‚Äù). Similarly the start of the decline in the ‚ÄúSusceptible‚Äù-function and the incline in the ‚ÄúRemoved‚Äù-function were shifted depending on the positioning of measurements. In conclusion and as expected a higher observation frequency of the data-underlying the time-dependent process significantly increased the fit of MultiNODEs to the process although general trends could already be approximated for lower assessment frequencies.

Fig. 6: Model benchmarking on simulated data from the SIR model. Each panel (a‚Äìc) represents the evaluation of another parameter (assessment frequency sample size and noise level respectively). Full size image

Investigating the effect of the sample size on training MultiNODEs we observed that an increase of the sample size led to an expected improvement of the model fit to the SIR dynamics (Fig. 6b). While the general trends could again be learned from limited data (n = 100) sample sizes of 1000 or 5000 substantially reduced the model‚Äôs deviation from the true SIR model. With 1000 samples the learned dynamic is less stable than when trained on 5000 samples where a smooth dynamic was learned that closely resembled the true underlying process. In conclusion MultiNODEs can already learn longitudinal dynamics based on only a few data points however they tend to underfit under these circumstances and benefit from larger sample sizes.

Adding an increasing noise level to the SIR training data revealed that MultiNODEs remain very robust (Fig. 6c). Only when introducing 100% of the maximal encountered value as additional noise a clear deviation from the underlying true model could be observed."

Three graders two trucks one tractor and still lots of room left to work.

ALAMEDA - A new maintenance shop for the RM of Moose Creek had been in the works for years.

It was time to build. Council visited shops of other municipalities to get ideas and it was decided that a building of 30 1/2 metres by 61 metres would be more than sufficient for their needs both now and in the future.

In 2017 the ground was leveled in 2018 the concrete pad was poured and the building shell erected. Throughout 2019 the inside work and finishing touches were done and towards the end of that year everything was finished. Most of the work was done by local contractors.

All that remained was for the RM and Town of Alameda to celebrate. But along came COVID-19 and the celebration plans were put on hold.

Over two years later on Aug. 9 the grand opening party finally took place. Hamburgers and hot dogs were the main course cooked on a barbecue provided by Baker Hughes. Cupcakes were the dessert and beverages were kept cool in the bucket of a one-week-old tractor.

Two bouncy castles were set up for children who were too young to appreciate the significance of the new building.

The new facility is an upgrade for the RM. It replaces two much smaller shops that were located in the town. As a result the heavy equipment no longer needs to travel the streets of Alameda.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot nicer with lots of room to work‚Äù said foreman Kirk Brooks. ‚ÄúThe old shop was full when three graders were put in it leaving no room to work. The new building‚Äôs wash bay is the same size as the whole previous main shop.‚Äù

The novelty of the new shop hasn‚Äôt worn off for Brooks. He continues to take a lot of pride in it and keeps it spotless.

Kelvin Luedtke is the reeve of the RM of Moose Creek. Like Brooks he too was extremely proud of the finished project.

‚ÄúAs council we‚Äôre very proud of this building. It is extremely well done. It suits the purpose 100 per cent and should be here for a century to come. It is a true asset that all the ratepayers can be proud of.‚Äù

Perhaps what he appreciated most was that none of the $2 million that was required for the building had to be borrowed. The municipality had all the money on hand. He expressed this fact as part of his short welcoming address to those who had come to celebrate.

The building has been completed and so has the celebrating.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N3b3JsZC5pbi9hcnRpY2xlL29pbC1wcmljZXMtZG93bi0xNS1mb3ItdGhlLXdlZWstb24tcmVjZXNzaW9uLWppdHRlcnMtNDQzMDIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oil Prices Down 1.5% For The Week On Recession Jitters,ERROR: You must `download()` an article first!,,,,,,

How Ooho edible water spheres work

Ooho spheres are created by dipping frozen liquid balls into an algae mixture that forms a membrane around the ice. The ice melts into liquid water and membrane which is edible and biodegradable forming a watertight seal around it. To consume the liquid you can either bite into the tasteless membrane. You could also sip it out or eat the entire ball membrane and all.

But there were a few problems with the company‚Äôs approach. Skipping Rocks Lab‚Äôs mission to make Ooho a staple of festivals marathons and other outdoor events was a great start. Those are situations in which single-serving beverages without waste are well suited. But their wider goal was to become ‚Äúthe global solution to water and drinks on the go.‚Äù This was an impossible task.

Unlike bottles single-gulp water is not something most of us need or would even find a way to use daily. The membrane is pretty delicate as demonstrated in videos showcasing Ooho being drank. It is not something you‚Äôd toss in a bag or backpack on its own. And because the membrane is edible. If Skipping Rocks envisioned Ooho being sold at grocery stores it would mean selling it within another external packaging. This is because of the delicate edible membrane. And this completely negates its ‚Äúpackaging-free‚Äù mission.

What happened to Ooho

The no-plastic-needed concept turned Ooho edible water into a bit of a viral sensation. But the idea wasn‚Äôt as sustainable as the company thought. The spheres have a limited shelf life and begin to shrivel and break after a short time. In July 2019 the company rebranded from Skipping Rocks Lab to Notpla standing for Not Plastic.

Ooho is still definitely a fantastic idea. There might be a way to utilize this idea in the future. Recently sauce sachets are coming soon on the company‚Äôs website. You can still purchase Ooho edible water spheres. They are still used for cocktails and races.

But with the rebrand Notpla has focused on sustainable packaging that is a bit sturdier. Notpla started making seaweed-coated food packaging. The packaging is made from seaweed and other plants making it biodegradable. It is designed for liquids and is biodegradable from four to six weeks.

Notpla containers

This is made for on-the-go consumption and it is more sustainable than plastic ones. You can purchase a case of 200 of them so it is an excellent option for restaurants. The dimension of each box is 90 x 110mm on the base 106 x 127mm on the top and 65mm for height. Suitable for wet cold hot or dry food there is a place for these. They are home compostable as well. The packaging doesn‚Äôt contain any PET recycling.

Notpla is a London startup that has raised ‚Ç¨6.3 million and looks to move towards getting rid of packaging. Notpla formed a partnership in 2019 with Just Eat and Unilever to create more sustainable food packaging. The containers and Ooho contribute to eliminating acid in our oceans.

They also sell pipettes that are 12 units for ‚Ç¨12. They can hold oil making it easier to drizzle some over your pizza pasta or vegetables.

That‚Äôs according to blockchain market intelligence firm Blockdata‚Äôs list of the ‚ÄúMost Active Investors in Blockchain Companies By the Top 100 Public Companies‚Äù released earlier this month. It looked at the 10 months from September 2021 through June 2022.

While the firms that held venture funding rounds weren‚Äôt necessarily pure-play payments firms their offerings included payments services. These are Fireblocks Circle FTX Anchorage Digital New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) and ConsenSys.

Investment firm Digital Currency Group gets an honorary nod for portfolio investments in Abra Avanti Bank AZA (formerly Bitpesa) and a fair number of other crypto payments companies under the remaining 25 letters.

The 10 investors that Blockdata said were the largest crypto investors are Alphabet BlackRock Morgan Stanley Samsung Goldman Sachs BNY Mellon PayPal Microsoft Commonwealth Bank and Prosus.

Now there is a big asterisk next to this list as Blockdata said quite plainly that it couldn‚Äôt get the actual dollar amounts of each company‚Äôs individual investments. As such they took the size of the rounds as a proxy on the theory that investors spend more on companies that raise more.

As for the firms offering payments:

Anchorage Digital is a digital asset custody firm that received the crypto industry‚Äôs first federal bank charter. Aside from that it has a specific offering giving merchants the ability to settle payments ranging from peer-to-peer to cross-border.

Circle is the issuer of the USD Coin stablecoin the No. 2 stablecoin with a market capitalization of $52.5 billion. It also offers payments and treasury infrastructure for the internet.

ConsenSys is an Ethereum-focused incubator. Among its companies is CodeFi a B2B digital currency solution for payments and finance.

Fireblocks in February acquired stablecoin and digital asset payments technology platform First Digital.

FTX one of the largest crypto exchanges has its payments arm FTX Pay.

NYDIG owns real-time bitcoin payments application Bottlepay.

Blue-Chip Stock #7: Verizon Communications (VZ)

Dividend History: 17 years of consecutive increases

17 years of consecutive increases Dividend Yield: 5.7%

5.7% Expected Total Return: 16.4%

Verizon Communications was created by a merger between Bell Atlantic Corp and GTE Corp in June 2000. Verizon is one of the largest wireless carriers in the country. Wireless contributes three-quarters of all revenues and broadband and cable services account for about a quarter of sales. The company‚Äôs network covers ~300 million people and 98% of the U.S.

On July 22 2022 the company reported the fiscal year‚Äôs second-quarter and first six months results. Revenue was flat year over year (YoY) at $33.8 billion for the quarter compared to the second quarter in 2021. Earnings came in at $1.24 per share a decrease of 11.4% compared to the $1.40 per share the company made in 2Q201.

Source: Investor Presentation

The company had a net addition of 268000 including 256000 fixed wireless net additions. Total broadband net additions increased by 39000 from first-quarter 2022 and fixed wireless net additions increased by 62000 from first-quarter 2022.

The cash flow from operations was down for the year‚Äôs first half from $20.4 billion to $17.7 billion. While capital expenditures were up $2.4 billion to $10.5 billion in the first half. Thus Free cash flow for the quarter was down from $11.7 billion to $7.2 billion for the first half of the year.

We expect annual returns of 16.4% over the next five years consisting of 4% EPS growth the 5.7% dividend yield and a 6.7% return from an expanding P/E multiple.

Blue-Chip Stock #6: State Street (STT)

Dividend History: 12 years of consecutive increases

12 years of consecutive increases Dividend Yield: 3.2%

3.2% Expected Total Return: 16.6%

State Street Corporation is a Boston based financial services company which traces its roots back to 1792. State Street is one of the largest asset management firms in the world with approximately $4 trillion of assets under management and $44 trillion of assets under custody and administration.

In September of 2021 State Street announced the acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services for $3.5 billion which would make State Street the number one asset servicing firm globally. Asset servicing provides back-end operations for many of the world‚Äôs most popular funds and ETF‚Äôs. State Street‚Äôs main competitors include BlackRock Bank of New York Mellon and Vanguard.

In mid-July State Street reported (7/15/22) financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Fee revenues dipped -6% over last year‚Äôs quarter due to headwinds from weaker stock markets and bond markets.

However net interest income grew 25% thanks to higher interest rates and the bank generated high forex trading earnings and kept its total expenses essentially flat. As a result its earnings-per-share grew 11% sequentially from $1.57 to $1.74 and exceeded the analysts‚Äô consensus by $0.20.

We expect annual returns of 16.6% per year for State Street. This will be driven by 7% expected EPS growth plus the 3.2% dividend yield and a sizable boost from an expanding P/E multiple.

Blue-Chip Stock #5: Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)

Source: Investor Presentation

Comcast has had 14 consecutive dividend increases. The fast dividend growth was possible through solid earnings growth and a safe dividend payout ratio. Its dividend is well-covered by earnings and cash flows. Comcast is one of the largest players in the entertainment industry. New market entrants would have to spend many billions of dollars to establish as a key cable player or entertainment network.

The cable industry is impacted by the nationwide cord-cutting trend though as some customers are ditching traditional pay-TV entirely. Comcast has so far been able to withstand this trend through growth from its other businesses.

Blue-Chip Stock #2: Sonoco Products (SON)

Dividend History: 40 years of consecutive increases

40 years of consecutive increases Dividend Yield: 3.2%

3.2% Expected Total Return: 17.8%

Sonoco Products provides packaging industrial products and supply chain services to its customers. The markets that use the company‚Äôs products include those in the appliances electronics beverage construction and food industries.

Sonoco Products is now composed of 2 segments Consumer Packaging and Industrial Packaging with all other businesses listed as ‚Äúall other‚Äù.

On July 21st 2022 Sonoco Products reported second quarter earnings results for the period ending July 3rd 2022. Revenue surged 38.4% to a company record $1.91 billion which was in-line with analysts‚Äô expectations. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $1.76 compared very favorably to $0.84 in the prior year and was $0.11 above estimates.

Source: Investor Presentation

Consumer Packaging revenues grew 65.6% to a segment record $990.1 million due once again in large part to the purchase of Ball Metalpack that closed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Higher selling prices also factored into results. Global rigid paper containers had slight volume growth outside of North America where supply constraints limited business.

Flexible packaging volume grew 4% but was offset by mix. Industrial Paper Packing sales grew 20% to a segment record $727.4 million as higher selling prices more than offset a small volume decline and currency exchange headwinds.

Sonoco Products raised its outlook for 2022 as well with the company expecting adjusted earnings-per-share of $6.20 to $6.30 for the year up from $5.25 to $5.45 and $4.60 to $4.80 previously.

.

Source: Investor Presentation

During the past five years the company‚Äôs dividend payout ratio has averaged around 33%. With the current payout ratio of 27% THG‚Äôs dividend payments are well covered by earnings. Given the expected earnings growth there is still room for the dividend to continue to grow moving forward while maintaining a payout ratio below 30%.

The Hanover Insurance Group is a diversified and solid insurer with a differentiated P&C franchise in a fragmented market. With their differentiating strategy such as specialized products and distinctive agency partnerships the company can strengthen its competitive advantages. Furthermore Hanover Insurance has a S&P and AM Best ‚ÄúA‚Äù-rating and a stable outlook.

We expect 11% EPS growth over the next five years. In addition the stock has a 2.3% dividend yield while we expect 5.1% returns from an expanding P/E multiple.

The quaint village of Saltford nestled between the bustling cities of Bristol and Bath is more than just a passing point along the A4 Bath Road. Despite its location on a key route it boasts a tight-knit community where ""everyone knows each other and feels like they belong"".

Once perceived as lacking identity Saltford has transformed into a thriving hub for families couples and young people. Over the past decade the village has embraced numerous changes evident in the 'sold' signs dotting almost every street corner. Its prime position along a busy A-road and the scenic Bristol Bath railway path make it an attractive place to settle down.

Saltford offers a diverse range of homes from luxury properties with expansive driveways and mechanical gates to charming cottages adorned with plants and flowers. It also houses hidden architectural gems like the grade II listed Saltford House believed to have been built in the 1700s by architect Thomas Bennett for his personal use.

Like any desirable location house prices in Saltford reflect its growing popularity. However data from Rightmove indicates that the overall average price of homes there was ¬£492222 over the last year marking a 10 per cent decrease from the previous year reports Bristol Live.

According to Rightmove's records ""The majority of sales in Saltford during the last year were semi-detached properties selling for an average price of ¬£487400. Detached properties sold for an average of ¬£571500 with terraced properties fetching ¬£425000.""

Saltford offers easy access to Keynsham's town centre with a mere stroll and city centres and rural pubs are just a short drive away. The public transport system is quite capable with two primary services between Bristol and Bath the X39 and 39 still running every half hour into the pre-dawn hours despite the 2023 bus cuts that affected other areas. Additionally there's the A4 an hourly airport service.

Saltford also boasts places like The Riverside Inn on the banks of the River Avon and Thai Cafe on Bath Road offering delectable meal options. Though Thai Cafe primarily serves scrumptious Thai food in the evenings it has become such an integral part of the community that it invites people in for a daytime cuppa.

During a 2022 visit Nikki the proprietor of Thai Cafe shared: ""Saltford has become the place to be. Everyone knows each other and helps each other out.""

""I have been here for about 20 years. It used to be mostly retired people who lived here but we are getting more families and young people now.""

Nikki pointing to the restaurant's interior expressed her gratitude for local support: ""People around the village have helped to make the restaurant what it is today. If something is broken someone will help and fix it.""

She continued to praise the community spirit saying ""People in the community helped me to get the restaurant up and running when we had to shut for eight months. Everyone is so nice and so helpful. That's what makes the village so great the people in it. I feel like I belong.""

Highlighting the perks of village life Nikki added ""In Saltford you have things like parking space. You don't get that in most cities. I also know that if I walk home at 10pm from work I will be safe. You don't get antisocial behaviour around here.""

Overlooking the bustling Bath Road Thai Cafe benefits from the traffic calming measures. ""Luckily traffic is slowed down because of the traffic lights"" Nikki remarked.

""We do get a lot of cars go by but people have to get to work and we understand that. Those people the people that drive through the village aren't the people that live here.""

As the warmer months roll in Saltford becomes a haven for wild swimmers kayakers and paddleboarders boasting a picturesque marina and the Bristol Avon Sailing Club making it a perfect destination for water enthusiasts.

Salford Parish Council is at the helm of addressing local concerns in the village. A spokesperson for the Parish Council shared with BristolLive their pride in the community stating: ""Many people who live and work in the village make Saltford a great place to be through their voluntary contributions which are celebrated annually through the Saltford Parish Council Community Awards. Much of the community activity is centred around Saltford Hall run by the Saltford Community Association.""

""Saltford is fortunate to have a community run Post Office and library on the A4 Bath Road as well as many active commercial businesses based around the village. Saltford is surrounded by green belt land which preserves its rural setting; care of the local environment is a matter close to many villagers' hearts as shown by the many members of the Saltford Environment Group and Saltford Wombles.""

""The village is served by the Bristol to Bath Railway Path which is popular with walkers and cyclists alike. As a rural community Saltford Parish Council welcomes considerate visitors who follow the countryside code who leave no trace of their visit by taking their litter home or use one of the many bins around the village. Saltford's residents appreciate considerate parking by visitors and use of public transport is strongly encouraged due to limited parking in the village.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEyL3VwdG93bi1hcGFydG1lbnRzLXVudmVpbGVkLWluLXJlZGV2ZWxvcGVkLWRvd250b3duLWJhdGgtYmxvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uptown apartments unveiled in redeveloped downtown Bath block,"The Midcoast‚Äôs housing crunch eased slightly this month as developers unveiled 60 new Bath apartments geared toward senior residents.

The new apartment complex called The Uptown features 60 mostly one-bedroom apartments for tenants aged 55 and older. The apartments are for mixed-income households with rents ranging between $794 and $1495 per month. Around 42 apartments are classified as low-income according to developer The Szanton Company.

A large crowd gathered for the grand opening of the redeveloped Moses and Columbia Block Buildings on the corner of Front and Summer streets on May 8.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a housing shortage here and everywhere in Maine so the fact that we have one unit still available before we even open our doors speaks to the need for housing‚Äù said The Szanton Company Vice President Amy Cullen.

Around 10 existing units were already open in the Moses and Columbia building with Szanton adding four more units there Cullen said.

Applications for The Uptown opened in January with the apartments filling up in about one month leaving just one unit available at the time of the grand opening. The new tenants started moving into The Uptown on May 10.

‚ÄúThere is a housing crisis in the state and Bath is no exception‚Äù said Bath City Council Chairperson Mary Ellen Bell. ‚ÄúThe Uptown project builds density in the downtown recreates underutilized space and provides attainable housing for some of our older residents.‚Äù

The newest addition of the building that connects to the renovated Columbia and Moses housing block sits on what used to be an empty lot that was once home to the Bath YMCA. Szanton bought the historic Moses and Columbia blocks back in 2020 with construction beginning in the summer of 2022 according to Cullen.

‚ÄúThe rehab of the existing historic building Moses and Columbia block that this project contains had a lot more work than we expected‚Äù Cullen said.

Most of the new tenants come from the Bath area with some coming in from out of state.

‚ÄúFor years to come these affordable homes are going to be a remarkable and lasting tribute to those who have worked so hard for affordable housing in this City of Ships‚Äù said MaineHousing Director Daniel Brennan.

Berkshire had applied to increase its stake on July 11 saying it would not hurt competition undermine regulatory authority or boost costs for consumers. FERC regulates the interstate transmission of electricity natural gas and oil.

The share price of Houston-based Occidental has more than doubled this year benefiting from rising oil prices following Russia‚Äôs Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Berkshire began buying Occidental shares four days later.

Buffett‚Äôs Omaha Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock which helped finance the 2019 purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion.

Berkshire also ended June with a $23.7 billion stake in a larger oil company Chevron (CVX).

‚ÄúBuffett is taking advantage of stock market participants who are foolish about the oil and gas industry and consider it a dead business‚Äù said Cole Smead president of Smead Capital Management Inc in Phoenix which owns Occidental and Berkshire shares. ‚ÄúBuffett thinks it can make him wealthy.‚Äù

Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to Buffett‚Äôs assistant.

Occidental spokesman Eric Moses said the higher ownership limit was ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù because the company owned assets subject to FERC regulation. It said the prior limit was 25%.

FERC‚Äôs authorization does not require Berkshire to buy any Occidental shares.

Some investors and analysts have nonetheless said Berkshire could eventually buy Occidental diversifying an energy portfolio that includes several utilities electricity distributors and renewable power projects including wind.

Buffett completed one of his biggest acquisitions the $26.5 billion purchase of the BNSF railroad in 2010 after Berkshire had amassed a 22.6% stake.

Takeover?

Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he ‚Äúliked Occidental more as a wholly-owned subsidiary under the Berkshire umbrella‚Äù because it would reduce Occidental‚Äôs costs to access capital and reduce exposure to commodity markets volatility.

Independent oil analyst Paul Sankey added that Occidental can benefit from the expanded tax credit for carbon-capture projects included in the Inflation Reduction Act signed this month by President Joe Biden.

‚ÄúI can see him taking the whole thing private‚Äù Sankey said referring to Buffett.

Smead in contrast said Buffett is unlikely to buy all of Occidental soon and can instead buy more shares on the open market at lower prices than in a full takeover.

‚ÄúIn the long run he may but you don‚Äôt file something like this with FERC if you‚Äôre planning it in the next six months‚Äù Smead said.

Berkshire ended June with $105.4 billion of cash and equivalents even after buying a net $45.2 billion of stocks in the year‚Äôs first half.

Buffett has pledged to keep $30 billion on hand. Occidental‚Äôs market value was about $66 billion after Friday‚Äôs run-up.

Berkshire owns more than 90 companies outright including Geico car insurance See‚Äôs Candies Dairy Queen ice cream and several manufacturing businesses.

At Berkshire‚Äôs annual meeting on April 30 Buffett said he began buying Occidental shares after reviewing an analyst presentation.

He also expressed confidence in Chief Executive Vicki Hollub who has been reducing Occidental‚Äôs debt.

‚ÄúShe says she doesn‚Äôt know the price of oil next year. Nobody does‚Äù Buffett said. ‚ÄúBut we decided it made sense.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc3B5c2NhcGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtdGhlLXRydWUtc3VwZXJoZXJvLXdpdGgtdGhlLWdpZnQtb2YtZm9yZXNpZ2h00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett: The True Superhero with the Gift of Foresight,"Warren was born in 1930 in Omaha Nebraska and from an incredibly early age he was displaying the qualities that would later make his fortune. Warren didn‚Äôt just have a prodigious talent for numbers he was also determined to make use of those skills to make money in any way he could. In the beginning this meant hanging around gas stations collecting discarded bottle caps. While his contemporaries played seven-year-old Buffett was doing market research diligently logging the brands of the bottle caps he found and taking note of which brands sold best in which areas. The answer was predominantly Coca-Cola so the young entrepreneur went to his uncle who ran a local grocery store and cut a wholesale deal to buy crates of six Cokes for a quarter. He then hit the streets selling the bottles door-to-door for a nickel a piece making a tidy profit in the process.

The remarkable life of Warren Buffett has been full of shrewd investments that led him to briefly become the richest man on Earth before promptly giving most of his fortune to charities fighting to halt climate change and eradicate poverty and disease. While he continues to accumulate wealth through his tremendous knowledge of the stock market and is widely revered as the most influential figure in investment history he continues to donate billions to philanthropic causes while inspiring others to follow his lead a True Superhero of philanthropy as well as investment.

‚Äç

Buffett would later lament that he did not invest those profits in Coca-Cola shares which would have paid him handsome dividends down the years. He did not waste his funds though choosing instead to plow his profits back into an ever-increasing roster of investments and business ideas. He bought his first stocks aged 11 and when he turned 13 he took on a paper route which he approached with typical entrepreneurial hustle keeping track of the magazine subscriptions of the houses on his route and then selling renewals to his customers. By the time he was 15 he had accumulated over $2000 from the paper route alone and he kept the proceeds in a jealously guarded sock drawer which was only ever opened to fund further projects. One such investment was to buy a farm when he turned 14 which he rented out to a Nebraska farmer in a profit-sharing agreement. He then turned his hand to the amusement industry installing pinball machines in local barber shops and reaping the enormous profits from the burgeoning craze before disaster struck: his father informed him that it was time to abandon his many hustles and head to college.

‚Äç

Becoming the Sage of Omaha

Warren complained bitterly about being forced to continue his education; he saw no upside to it and wished only to pursue his business ideas but his father was adamant. Thanks to his extracurricular activities Warren‚Äôs grades in high school had been ‚Äúgood but not great‚Äù but he applied to Harvard Business School with a great deal of confidence. To his surprise they rejected his application and so he hurriedly approached Columbia University. The acceptance letter came so late there was no time for Buffett to find accommodation and he stayed in the local YMCA but the hurried outcome proved serendipitous as it connected Warren with one of his idols Benjamin Graham who was known as ‚Äúthe father of value investing‚Äù who was teaching at Columbia at the time. Graham would eventually offer Buffett a job and mentored the young investor - Warren even named his first son Howard Graham Buffett - after his idol but Buffett‚Äôs fortune would be made elsewhere.

‚Äç

One Saturday in 1951 Buffett went to the offices of GEICO hoping to find Graham there. Instead he found Lorimer Davidson GEICO‚Äôs vice president; Davidson found the young man fascinating and gave him an impromptu crash course in the insurance industry. Buffett was very taken with this new field of business and promptly invested half his net worth in GEICO shares cashing out a year later with a tidy 50% profit. This would prove to be a mistake as GEICO‚Äôs shares continued to rise and many years later Buffett would buy into GEICO again this time buying up the entire business through his holding company Berkshire Hathaway.

‚Äç

The $200bn mistake

Berkshire Hathaway had originally been formed as a merger between textile businesses in 1955 but by the early ‚Äò60sthe firm was failing and slowly closing its many mills. Buffett began buying up its stock after he noticed that the firm would typically buy back its shares after closing a mill and two years later this came to pass with the firm‚Äôs owner Seabury Stanton making a verbal offer to buy back Buffett‚Äôs holding at $11¬Ω per share. Unfortunately when the tender offer arrived the offer price had dropped to $11‚Öú. Infuriated Buffett instead bought more of the firm‚Äôs stock assumed ownership of the firm and then fired Stanton. He was now the owner of a failing textile business and over the course of the next 20 years he tried to revive Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs core business without success. He would later claim that this decision cost him $200bn because the money he wasted in trying to revive the textile business could instead have been used to fund Buffett‚Äôs other more profitable investments. The great irony is that these were all carried out in Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs name and by 2008 the success of the non-textile related operations of the firm led to Buffett having a personal net worth of $62bn making him the richest man in the world at that time.

‚Äç

By this point Buffett had started to give his wealth away. In 2006 he announced a plan to gradually donate almost all of his total worth to charity with the vast bulk of it going to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill Gates had credited Buffett with being the inspiration behind the foundation in the first place and now Buffett was putting his money where his mouth was with an initial gift of Berkshire Hathaway shares worth $30.7bn the largest charitable donation in history and an enormous boost to the Foundation‚Äôs goals of combating climate change and eradicating global poverty and disease. Buffett resigned as a trustee of the Foundation in 2021 by which point his annual contributions to the fund had totalled over $41bn half of his overall net worth. This was a significant milestone for Buffettas he and Gates were also the instigators of the Giving Pledge in 2010 which encourages other high net worth individuals to pledge half of their total wealth to philanthropic causes. By 2016 an estimated $600bn had been pledged and the number of signatories to the Pledge grew year on year with 236 pledges coming from donors in 28 countries by 2022.

‚Äç

Although Buffett has already fulfilled his obligations as laid out in the Giving Pledge he continues to donate his tremendous wealth to philanthropic causes with much of it now being channeled through his own Buffett Foundation which focuses on healthcare research and advocacy. While he is determined to give his entire fortune away he continues to be an extremely successful and influential investor making money faster than he can give it away; by 2022 his net worth has increased to $106.6bn although this now only qualifies him as the world‚Äôs seventh wealthiest person. Being unable to give your money away fast enough is an unusual challenge to face but Buffett‚Äôs uncanny ability to see the future of stocks continues to fuel worthwhile causes around the world a True Superhero of philanthropy who continues to inspire and support millions of people.

Should You?,"Buffett's position makes him one of the company's largest shareholders.

Warren Buffett's firm Berkshire Hathaway originally bought 68.9 million shares of Paramount Global (PARA 1.69%) in the first quarter of 2022. During the second quarter the Oracle of Omaha added another 9.5 million shares to bring his total ownership to 78.4 million by the end of the year's first half.

Buffett now owns nearly 13% of the company's Class B shares making him the largest such shareholder. Here's why you should own shares too.

Content is king

In the immortal words of Paramount's founder Sumner Redstone ""content is king."" That may be what Buffett saw when he initially built a position in the company's stock. Paramount's branded networks include Nickelodeon Comedy Central and BET. Perhaps more captivating are Paramount's news and sports franchises which air on cable broadcast and streaming platforms.

One of America's favorite sports is football and Paramount is an NFL staple. The company holds rights to AFC and NFC regular season games playoff games and the Super Bowl on a rotating basis with other networks. Its rights also include college football games from the Southeastern Conference and conference championship games from other power conferences.

The list goes on. Paramount also hosts games from regular season college basketball games and the NCAA's wildly popular annual March Madness tournament. Every year March Madness is followed by another annual sports tradition the Masters PGA golf tournament. Paramount has the rights to that too.

Though football is one of the most popular sports in the U.S. soccer is the international favorite. Paramount's soccer rights feature more than 2000 matches each year from UEFA Champions League Italy's Serie A and the National Women's Soccer League shown on its streaming platform Paramount+.

Paramount's vast content library and sports rights have grown streaming subscribers domestically but its international partnerships could be the next leg of growth in subs. For instance the company has partnered with European cable giant Sky to bundle Paramount+ with its cable offering. During the last quarter Paramount+ launched in the U.K. Ireland and South Korea. In September the streaming platform will launch in Italy and later this year in Germany Austria France and Switzerland. The best part of Paramount's partnership strategy is that each new subscriber comes with zero acquisition cost.

Capitalizing on its international sports momentum Paramount recently won the streaming rights to air Indian Premier League Cricket (IPL) for the next five years. Like soccer in many countries Cricket is easily the favorite sport in India. However there is one big difference -- India is the world's second-most populous country. Previously Disney's Hotstar streaming platform which has 50 million paid subscribers hosted IPL matches. Now Paramount will seek to transition those viewers to Paramount+.

Last quarter management told investors it saw strong acquisitions and engagement on Paramount+ from its new stable of TV shows which includes 1883 and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. On top of that the company's eagerly anticipated theatrical release of Top Gun: Maverick was a smash at the global box office raking in $1.3 billion and supplanting Paramount's own Titanic at No. 7 in all-time domestic box office receipts.

Buffett bought it should you?

Buffett likes to buy downtrodden stocks of companies that he believes can thrive in the long run meaning he likes to buy the dip just as much as anyone else. Paramount stock has certainly dipped collapsing 32% over the last year.

Part of the reason for the stock's underperformance is due to many investors focusing squarely on subscriber growth. In its second quarter Paramount added 5.2 million subscribers to its platforms and removed 3.9 million from Russia for a net gain of 1.7 million. Even before accounting for the Russian removals that number is down from the 6.3 million subs it added in the first quarter.

Other streamers are seeing growth moderate as well. Disney+ subscriber growth slowed in the second quarter and the company lowered its long-term subscriber goal. Netflix actually lost subscribers last quarter and said losses would likely continue this quarter.

Investor concerns also extend to losses generated by the streamers. Paramount's direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment has lost money in the last two quarters since management began reporting it as an independent segment. Management expects peak losses from its DTC segment to occur next year. Disney expects its streaming platforms to be profitable in 2024.

Building out the infrastructure to host streaming platforms requires an enormous amount of capital but Paramount is nearing the finish line. After that ongoing expenditures should diminish considerably. Paramount expects to increase revenue in its DTC segment from $2.3 billion in the first half of 2022 to $9 billion by 2024 a year after peak losses.

If you're truly a long-term investor like Buffett you'll want to buy and hold the beaten-down stock of this high-quality company and wait a few years. That's a strategy right out of the Buffett playbook.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9oZXJlcy13aHktd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtbG92ZXMtb2lsLWdpYW50LW9jY2lkZW50YWwtcGV0cm9sZXVtL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkzNjc1ODg0LmNtc9IBigFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9oZXJlcy13aHktd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtbG92ZXMtb2lsLWdpYW50LW9jY2lkZW50YWwtcGV0cm9sZXVtL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MzY3NTg4NC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here‚Äôs why Warren Buffett loves oil giant Occidental Petroleum,"Oil

CEO

Inflation Reduction Act









Famed investor Warren Buffett is steadily snowballing a stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp. in what could end up being his biggest-ever acquisition. His Berkshire Hathaway Inc. on Friday won approval to buy as much as 50% of the shares. Some investors believe it‚Äôs a step toward a full takeover which may end up costing more than $50 billion.Here‚Äôs why Occidental is attractive to Berkshire:Inflation looks to be the mega-trend for the first half of the 2020s and crude oil is one of the best natural hedges out there. Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and a lack of investment in new oilfields over the past five years have hit supplies leading to stagnant production profiles everywhere from OPEC to US shale. Meanwhile demand for fossil fuels has been strong coming out of the pandemic even as governments push for a switch to clean energy.With investments across the energy sector from utilities to solar power Buffett claims to be a realist in the debate around fossil fuels. ‚ÄúPeople that are on the extremes of both sides are a little nuts‚Äù he said at a Berkshire shareholder meeting in 2021.Buffett first invested in Occidental in 2019 when the oil company was in a bidding war with Chevron Corp. to buy its crosstown Houston rival Anadarko. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub flew to Omaha Nebraska on the company‚Äôs Gulfstream V and convinced Buffett to add $10 billion to her war chest. It was enough to swing the deal and Chevron pulled out soon after. In exchange Buffett got preferred shares yielding 8% annually plus warrants to buy more common stock at $59.62 apiece. Today with Occidental at $71.29 those warrants would turn a profit of more than $900 million if exercised.Initially the Anadarko deal was a disaster because it loaded up Occidental‚Äôs balance sheet with more than $30 billion of additional debt right before the pandemic. Occidental‚Äôs market value went from $50 billion before the 2019 transaction to less than $9 billion toward the end of 2020 as oil prices crashed.But on the flip side this created a good value play for Buffett. When crude turned around late last year and was supercharged by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine Occidental was best-placed to benefit. The stock is the best performer in the S&P 500 this year up more than 140% compared with the index‚Äôs 11% decline.‚ÄúOxy started this year heavily indebted with massive oil exposure‚Äù said Bill Smead who manages $4.8 billion at Smead Capital Management Inc. and is a top 20 shareholder in Occidental. Soaring crude prices mean ‚Äúthey‚Äôre now paying off that debt and gushing cash. It‚Äôs the best of all worlds.‚ÄùToo much cash has been Berkshire‚Äôs biggest investing challenge over the past few years. The conglomerate had about $105 billion on hand at the end of June. It is expected to generate about $8 billion in free cash flow each quarter for the next five years according to Greggory Warren of Morningstar Research Services LLC. Inflation at the highest in 40 years is a great incentive to put that money to work.Occidental would work better as a subsidiary of Berkshire than a stock holding ‚Äúgiven the volatility that exists in the energy/commodity markets‚Äù Warren said. ‚ÄúThis could end up though evolving into a slow-motion takeover where Berkshire buys up to the stakes that FERC allows it to acquire until it can acquire Oxy whole.‚ÄùOccidental is not only one of the biggest producers in the Permian Basin the largest US oilfield but it also has one of the lowest costs with an oil price of just $40 a barrel needed to sustain its dividend. West Texas Intermediate currently trades at about $90 a barrel. Hollub has reined in the ‚Äúdrill-baby-drill‚Äù mentality that characterized shale for the first decade of its lifespan and is now prioritizing profits over production. Free cash flow hit a record $4.2 billion in the second quarter.The Anadarko purchase may have been expensive but it allowed Occidental to lift its land holdings in the Permian to 2.8 million acres 14 times the size of New York City‚Äôs five boroughs combined. It also added steady cash-flowing assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Algeria.Buffett has a good personal relationship with Hollub which began at the 2019 meeting in Omaha brokered by Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan. This year the veteran investor praised Hollub after reading a transcript of Occidental‚Äôs Feb. 25 earnings conference call in which she pledged financial discipline even as oil prices were rising.‚ÄúI read every word and said this is exactly what I would be doing‚Äù Buffett told CNBC‚Äôs Becky Quick in ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù in March. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs running the company the right way.‚ÄùThe oil industry mostly criticized the Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law this month. The $437 billion legislation ‚Äúdiscourages needed investment in oil and gas‚Äù and offers ‚Äúthe wrong policies at the wrong time‚Äù the American Petroleum Institute said.But Hollub was surprisingly upbeat calling the bill ‚Äúvery positive.‚Äù That may have something to do with its expansion of tax credits for carbon capture of which Occidental is a leading proponent. The company has plans to build the world‚Äôs biggest direct air capture plant which will command a tax credit of as much as $180 for each ton of carbon sucked out of the air."

Why trust us?

The MacBook Air M2 is Apple‚Äôs latest swing at its fanless Air design. Like the M1 model it‚Äôs among the best laptops you can buy right now because of its excellent portability battery life and above all performance. But buying the wrong MacBook Air M2 could result in a laptop that‚Äôs up to 50% slower. Seriously.

In this guide we‚Äôre going to break down what the M2 MacBook Air is the different configurations available and answer if you should buy Apple‚Äôs latest laptop. Most importantly we‚Äôll guide you to the configuration you should buy to avoid a clear performance pitfall.

Here‚Äôs the M2 MacBook Air

The latest version of the MacBook Air comes with Apple‚Äôs M2 processor. It‚Äôs around 15%-20% faster than last-gen‚Äôs M1 depending on the application and the 2022 MacBook Air is the only laptop with the M2 chip outside of the 13-inch 2022 MacBook Pro. Don‚Äôt by swayed by the Pro model though. The M2 Air and Pro have largely similar performance.

Compared to the last-gen M1 MacBook Air the M2 model has a few changes. Like all Air designs this one is fanless with a focus on portability (it‚Äôs only 0.44 inch thick and 2.7 pounds). There are a few subtle design changes though including more rounding on the corners and a notch for the webcam that everyone loves to hate.

More importantly the M2 model comes with a Liquid Retina display which is sharper and provides a larger color range than the screen on the M1 MacBook Air. The notch even gives you an extra 0.3 inch of screen to look at. Apple also took the time to upgrade from two speakers on the M1 model to four on the M2 as well as improve the webcam to 1080p.

Apple also improved battery life with a slightly larger battery which lasted over 21 hours in our video playback testing. That‚Äôs hours above Windows laptops even those with the best battery life.

Avoid the base M2 MacBook Air at all costs

There are only two M2 MacBook Air models available that Apple has as a starting point:

256GB model 512GB model CPU cores Eight cores Eight cores GPU cores Eight cores 10 cores Memory 8GB Unified Memory 8GB Unified Memory Storage 256GB SSD 512GB SSD Ports 2x Thunderbolt 4 / USB 4 3.5mm headphone 2x Thunderbolt 4 / USB 4 3.5mm headphone Screen 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display Charger 30W USB-C adaptor 35W dual USB-C compact adaptor Price $1200 $1500 Where to buy

It seems simple enough but the choice between these two configurations is what will determine if you have a good M2 MacBook Air or a bad one.

Short answer: buy the 512GB model. Shortly after launching reviewers found out that the base 256GB model uses a single NAND chip for storage while the 512GB model and even the M1 MacBook Air use two chips. That results up to 50% slower SSD performance making the 256GB model feel more sluggish as it struggles to read and write data to the hard drive.

That‚Äôs why so many people are saying to avoid the $1200 M2 MacBook Air. It‚Äôs slower than the 512GB model sure but the fact that it‚Äôs slower than last-gen‚Äôs M1 version is the kicker.

For $300 extra you‚Äôre getting a much smoother laptop with the 512GB M2 MacBook Pro. It also comes with two extra GPU cores for around a 15% boost in graphics performance depending on the application (more on that below). The 512GB model also comes with a slightly larger 35W charger which will speed up charging times by just a hair.

Configuring the M2 MacBook Air

The M2 MacBook Air is a bit different than the previous generation in that you can configure up to 24GB of Unified Memory. That doesn‚Äôt mean you should though. Between storage the SOC and memory here‚Äôs the configuration I‚Äôd recommend:

Apple M2 with eight-core GPU eight-core CPU

16GB of Unified Memory

512GB SSD

67W USB-C power adaptor

This configuration comes out to $1600 or $100 more than the 512GB 10-core GPU model that Apple has as a starting point. 16GB of Unified Memory is the big difference as it can represent as much as a 25% improvement in apps like Adobe Premiere. It also provides a decent boost to coding environments like Xcode.

24GB doesn‚Äôt provide that same boost and it costs an additional $200. Most people won‚Äôt even notice a performance increase with 24GB even in apps like Premiere. The only argument for it is if you run a particularly RAM-intensive application and even then 16GB provides most of the benefit over 8GB.

The same goes for the 10-core GPU. It‚Äôs $100 more expensive and doesn‚Äôt provide much of a benefit in gaming or video editing apps. It is significantly faster than the eight-core model in 3D rendering apps like Blender though so consider spending the extra $100 if that‚Äôs your jam. If it‚Äôs not save the money. You won‚Äôt see any difference.

Should you buy the M2 MacBook Air?

If you‚Äôre sold on the M2 MacBook Air buy the 512GB one. It‚Äôs the clear choice and the extra $300 seems like chump change considering how much faster it is compared to the 256GB one. The M2 MacBook Air isn‚Äôt the best choice for everyone though shipping with a litany of issues that the older M1 MacBook Air didn‚Äôt have.

In particular the M2 MacBook Air has issues with overheating. It doesn‚Äôt have a heat spreader or fans and the M2 gets hot enough that it has to limit its performance to stay cool. Even the M2 MacBook Pro which comes with a fan for cooling reaches its thermal limit and starts reducing performance.

The M1 version by contrast has no issues with heat which is why it received the rare Editors‚Äô Choice award in our MacBook Air M1 review.

The M2 MacBook Air is more powerful so more heat is expected. But it‚Äôs not a clear choice over the M1 model. Apple‚Äôs latest chip provides about an 18% boost based on our testing and a slightly larger battery. For anyone browsing the web and running basic applications though the extra boost won‚Äôt be super relevant.

This is even more important when you consider price. The M1 MacBook Air is $1000 and as we covered above you‚Äôre almost forced into picking up the $1500 version of the M2 MacBook Air to get the same SSD performance. That‚Äôs why some people like our resident mobile expert Andy Boxall decided to get last-gen‚Äôs model when the M2 was announced.

Regardless of if you pick up the M1 or M2 model you‚Äôre getting a fantastic laptop (short of the 256GB M2 version that is). If you decide you don‚Äôt want to go with Apple for your next laptop though make sure to read our comparison between the M2 MacBook Air and the Dell XPS 13 Plus ‚Äî they trade blows well for around the same price. Apple has released the MacBook Pro M2 as well but the M2 Air is still a clear winner.

But there I was with the new Traeger Timberline hitting the ‚Äúsuper smoke‚Äù button and checking my temps at 6 am before my morning coffee making enough meat to feed 100 people at my town‚Äôs annual backyard kegger.

I haven‚Äôt just been cooking massive amounts of pork on Traeger‚Äôs freshly redesigned premium smoker. In fact this summer it‚Äôs become rare for me to cook anything that isn‚Äôt in some way smoked. Chicken salad? Smoke that chicken first. Steak? Smoke it before you sear it on the built-in induction burner. A fresh juicy melon? Throw it on the Traeger for 30 mins for a perfectly caramelized desert.

This smart smoker and induction burner provides the perfect all-in-one outdoor kitchen. Minus a middling Wi-Fi connection (you‚Äôll want to make sure your yard has solid coverage) the new Timberline delivers everything I‚Äôd want from a modern smoker and more: You can bake saut√© and smoke in a single unit that‚Äôs power- and fuel-efficient. After about two months I‚Äôve barely used a bag and a half of wood pellets. The fly in the smoke-ringed ointment? It costs $3500. That‚Äôs a lot of cash for any kitchen appliance.

A New Rig

The Timberline comes in a large orange box with clear instructions for setup but you may want a partner to help you move some of the heavier bits. The heart of the system is a sizable insulated smoke box with room for six pork shoulders or about the equivalent racks of ribs or chickens (the company also sells an XL version with roughly a third more space for an additional $300). Inside the smoke box there are three tiers you can put everything on with a vent for the smoke cut midway along the backside of the smoker so that it circulates fully to the top before venting.

There‚Äôs a drip tray and ash/grease catch in an easy-to-detach compartment in the cabinet below the smoker which also serves as a great place to store extra pellets and metal liners for the drip tray. You‚Äôll get a lot of use out of those metal drip liners before you need to replace one; the six pork shoulders only filled one up about halfway.

Besides the smoke box on the right of the unit you‚Äôll find a box where you can fill your wood pellets of choice (Traeger sent me an assortment of their own in-house pellets but you can use other brands). There‚Äôs even a plastic bin and special trap door so you can drop one type of pellet out of the auger for storage and put another type in if you want to smoke something with say hickory before switching back to applewood.

The main control area for the Timberline is on the right side of the unit via a very comfortable push-button knob and a color LCD display. The best way to use it though is to connect your phone to the grill via the Traeger app. Once you have it connected to your Wi-Fi you can control every aspect of the machine (including setting timers and temperature alerts) from your smartphone. It‚Äôs pretty damn nifty. You just want to make sure your router has enough range because I experienced a spotty connection on the Traeger now and then.

The left side of the Timberline houses an induction burner which pairs perfectly with cast iron pans for searing items you‚Äôve just cooked to perfection on the smoker or for cooking companion dishes while you wait for something to finish smoking.

Accessory rails surround the front and sides of the smoker and give you a place to put things like a paper towel holder a pop-up holding tray and hooks for grill tools. Traeger sent me those accessories which are nice and all but not necessary especially since they cost a lot. You‚Äôll pay $120 for a front shelf $60 for a bin to store utensils and $120 for a stainless steel grill tray. Yikes. The one accessory you need‚Äîa grill cover‚Äîcosts an astonishing $180. No it‚Äôs not made of silk."

By Park Jae-hyuk



POSCO Group Chairman Choi Jeong-woo met with representatives from BlackRock and GIC in Singapore last week to talk with the two major foreign shareholders of POSCO Holdings about the group's achievements and plans for the future the company said Sunday.



BlackRock was the second-largest shareholder of POSCO Holdings with 5.02-percent stake as of June following the National Pension Service the largest shareholder with an 8.3-percent stake. GIC had a 3.3-percent stake in POSCO Holdings at the end of last year.



According to POSCO Group the chairman told the foreign institutional investors that the group's holding firm has focused more on the battery material business to establish the world's first comprehensive value chain in the supply of battery materials such as lithium and nickel. He also added that the group's flagship business in steelmaking will make more efforts to increase the sale of higher value-added products such as steel plates tailored for futuristic vehicles.



""As a leading environmental material company we have continued investing in new businesses to change our corporate identity"" Choi was quoted as saying by the company's press release. ""Based on our excellent business achievements and growth vision we will enhance shareholder-friendly policies and communications to live up to the expectation of our shareholders.""



In particular the chairman reportedly explained his company's shareholder returns.



After raising its annual dividend to 17000 won ($13) per share last year from around 10000 won the company paid 8000 won per share in dividends during the first half of this year. Earlier this month its board of directors decided to retire its treasury stocks worth 672.2 billion won for the first time in 18 years. POSCO Holdings said it plans to establish new shareholder-friendly policies next year for the 2023-2025 period.

About 1000 workers from two mines and two aboveground facilities southwest of Birmingham Alabama have been on strike against Warrior Met since April 2021 resisting brutal working conditions. Now the Biden NLRB is demanding the UMWA pay what amounts to $13000 per striker into the company‚Äôs pocket. The government says this is reimbursement for security guards security cameras repairs and production lost because of the strike plus buses for carrying scabs across picket lines.

This workforce routinely does six-day weeks and 12-hour days. The company operates on Sundays and almost all holidays. A hated company policy fires workers automatically if they miss four days of work in a year even because of health problems or family emergencies.

Early in the strike the company offered a raise of $1.50 an hour for 2021 to 2026. Workers retorted that back in 2016 they accepted a $6-an-hour reduction when the company declared bankruptcy and threatened mass layoffs if the workers didn‚Äôt ‚Äúhelp‚Äù shore up its profitability. More than 95 percent of the strikers voted no when the UMWA leadership put up this company offer as a tentative agreement.

The $13.3 million NLRB judgment is more than half of the strike pay distributed to 1000 strikers in 16 months. The UMWA provides only $350 a week or $18000 a year for miners‚Äô families to live on. The money grab goes to a company that made $146 million in profit for January to March this year and last year paid its CEO $5.7 million.

UMWA president Cecil Roberts denounced the NLRB judgment. ‚ÄúWhat is the purpose of a strike if not to impact the operations of the employer including production? ‚Ä¶ This is outrageous and effectively negates workers‚Äô right to strike.‚Äù He accused the NLRB of ‚Äútak[ing] up the company‚Äôs cause.‚Äù

But the UMWA leadership also announced that it agreed to a settlement deal after Warrior Met made its arguments before NLRB district administrators. Union leaders agreed to pay some monetary damages to the company which accused picketing strikers of rowdy illegal actions against scabs and which asked the NLRB to punish the union. The union statement says it was necessary to pay the company damages ‚Äúin order to save striking members ‚Ä¶ from days of hostile questioning by company lawyers‚Äù but that the NLRB then shocked union leaders by massively increasing the payment. It is self-evident that the union bureaucracy opened the door to this disastrous situation and that it did so largely relying on the NLRB‚Äôs goodwill. The line about sparing coal miners from hostile questions is a phony excuse.

Questioning whether the NLRB is at its core pro-worker neutral or pro-employer ‚Äî and why ‚Äî cannot be sidestepped. Many unionists believe that the NLRB is taking or will take progressive pro-labor actions. In fact the NLRB intervened as a referee to require a revote on unionization at Bessemer Alabama Amazon (which failed again). It has started pressing cases against Starbucks for some union busting firings.

Paul Prescod has written in Jacobin ‚ÄúLabor law especially in the United States is extremely limited in its scope and power of enforcement‚Äù but still ‚Äúthe new NLRB under Biden is a welcome change in the balance of power between workers and employers.‚Äù Union lawyer Gay Semel wrote in Jacobin ‚ÄúThe current union organizing wave is being held back by an underfunded NLRB.‚Äù Both authors are excited about Biden‚Äôs removal of some overtly anti-labor right-wingers from NLRB leadership positions and about the appointment of Jennifer Abruzzo briefly a union lawyer as head NLRB attorney.

The NLRB‚Äôs Warrior Met monetary order suggests a problem with these hypotheses. The NLRB does not exist to help workers win against our bosses. It is set up to be a referee. But it is not a neutral referee between two equal teams as in some symmetrical soccer game.

In particular the NLRB mediates strikes and economic conflicts. It is a part of the U.S. government which accepts that workers if we follow its rules and get approval have the right to organize and withhold labor in limited economic bargaining units. But it opposes muscular picketing and solidarity strikes. The NLRB does not hold that a striking workforce has the right to prevent production in their workplace. The NLRB upholds the opposite: that a company has the right at all times to access and use its property and that bringing scabs across picket lines is an essential legal principle.

This is not a hair-splitting argument. This is why Biden‚Äôs NLRB is imposing a $13.3 million fine on a union in favor of a coal company basically kicking a group of workers while they are down after fighting to win a strike for 16 months. The basic issue of ‚Äúwhich side are you on‚Äù is why the Biden NLRB has no moral qualms about supporting the company with the six-day workweek and the CEO who gets paid almost $6 million annually. Further it has no qualms about attacking Alabama coal miners who decided to fight back against mistreatment and overwork on the job they do 2000 feet underground.

MIDLETON qualified for the Cork U19 Premier 1 hurling championship final courtesy of their three-point victory over Blackrock after a high-scoring semi-final at Ballygarvan on Sunday.

A rousing start to the second-half during which they scored 1-5 without reply was the launchpad for success and a meeting with Valley Rovers in a few weeks.

While the advantage grew to 13 points 2-17 to 0-10 in the third quarter Blackrock fought back but their strong finish was not enough.

They will regret as well the 20 wides they struck over the hour.

Midleton led 1-12 to 0-10 after a fairly evenly contested opening half the goal in the 25th minute battled to the net by Niall Corcoran leaving them perfectly placed at the interval.

Michael Finn was crucial from frees too.

Interestingly with the wind at their backs some of Brion Saunderson‚Äôs puck-outs went wide at the other end.

Peter Linehan was the chief-scorer for Blackrock with seven points.

The momentum then swung the way of the east Cork side when Tadhg O‚ÄôLeary Hayes goaled two minutes after the restart. In a devastating spell they rattled off five points as well from David Cremin (2) Finn Rory Hartnett and Saunderson.

Blackrock had it all to do. But Fionn Coleman‚Äôs goal after he collected from Linehan‚Äôs sideline ball spurred them on.

The teams continued to trade points until Coleman struck again. This time from the 30 metres out and his green flag moved the city team to within seven on 53 minutes 2-13 to 2-20.

Midleton were still in a comfortable position as the clock wound down.

Blackrock though were not finished yet.

Goalkeeper Ross Brown added his sides third goal from a long-range free to cut the gap further and with the clock in the red sub James Lynch nabbed Blackrock‚Äôs fourth goal.

Midleton held out. A feature of the game was both goalkeepers on the scoreboard.

Midleton will meet Valley Rovers in the final after the Carrigdhoun club were awarded the other semi-final against Glen Rovers.

On Tuesday the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection published an updated list that showed the following Worcester County communities had limited outdoor water use to one day a week: Barre Blackstone Dudley Milford Millbury Northbridge Rutland Sturbridge Templeton Uxbridge Webster West Brookfield and Westborough.

In the following communities outdoor water use is also restricted but is allowed at least two days a week: Athol Auburn Boylston Douglas Fitchburg Gardner Grafton Holden Hopedale Leicester Leominster Lunenburg Spencer Sterling Sutton Shrewsbury Upton Warren West Boylston and Winchendon.

‚ÄúWater restrictions or bans during #drought & other #water emergencies are necessary for public health safety & welfare‚Äù the DEP wrote in a tweet.

While Worcester has not imposed water restrictions it is expected to enter stage 1 drought status by the end of the month.

On Aug. 9 Phil Guerin director of the Worcester water and sewer operations asked city residents to be more mindful of water use after the city‚Äôs 10 reservoirs were measured to be at 78.4% of its capacity.

‚ÄúWe want people to start thinking about water conservation at any time‚Äù Guerin said. ‚ÄúYou can sweep your driveway and sidewalk if you want to get the leaves as opposed to hosing it down.‚Äù

This year the drought emerged after a string of lower-than-normal rainfall in the last six months was punctuated in July with minimal precipitation and high temperatures.

The situation prompted increasingly concerned reactions by the state agency Energy and Environmental Affairs throughout the summer.

In mid-July the EEA announced that the state was seeing a drought in 90% of its regions with only Cape Cod not affected.

The drought worsened in time and the EEA designated on Aug. 9 a Critical Level 3 Drought in the Central Connecticut River Valley Northeast and Southeast Regions.

The Cape Cod Region was placed under Significant Level 2 Drought while a Mild Level 1 Drought was placed across Western and Islands Regions.

The EEA urged communities in Level 3 Critical Drought such as Central Massachusetts to ban all nonessential outdoor water use.

‚ÄúThe commonwealth is experiencing decreasing levels in some reservoirs dry streambeds ponding and diminished extent of streams in many watersheds leading to lack of flow increased turbidity higher water temperature and increase in growth of plants and algae in the water‚Äù wrote the EEA in an announcement. ‚ÄúAs the summer continues and low precipitation couples with high temperatures it is incredibly important that outdoor watering be limited to essential uses to reduce the strain on local water systems.‚Äù

Former Apollo Global Management principal Chirag Gupta joined the property investment division of pension fund manager Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) this month as a director with its real estate investment team.

‚ÄúWe are pleased to welcome Chirag Gupta to our growing Singapore team‚Äù Alessandro Fiascaris head of investments for Asia Pacific at Oxford Properties told Mingtiandi. ‚ÄúAn experienced investment professional with local experience of working both in Singapore and India he will add strength and depth to our team as we look to grow our presence and exposure to Asia Pacific which is an important growth region in our high conviction investment strategies.‚Äù

The former Blackstone managing director also called attention to the firm‚Äôs transfer of a senior member of its Ontario crew to Southeast Asia.

‚ÄúWe have also welcomed Shane Miyama to our Singapore team who has spent more than 16 years in progressively senior roles across investment and development at Oxford‚Äôs global headquarters in Toronto‚Äù Fiascaris said. ‚ÄúAs development director he will add his vast experience and focus on development projects and ventures in Asia Pacific.‚Äù

Team-Building in the Little Red Dot

Gupta and Miyama are joining Oxford Properties‚Äô base in Singapore just under eight months after Fiascaris left behind his 18-year stint at Blackstone to help pilot the $54 billion investment fund‚Äôs activities in Asia Pacific.

Gupta spent more than seven years with Apollo in both Singapore and India and also has earlier experience with HSBC Colliers and Rezone Investment Advisors in India.

Miyama has now been with Oxford for 16 years and has served as a director with its development team since the beginning of 2017.

The firm‚Äôs website shows that it is currently hiring for six roles in Singapore including executives for its capital markets and infrastructure teams.

Industrial Focus

Globally industrial accounts for around 40 percent of Oxford‚Äôs investment portfolio with the firm having taken a cornerstone stake in ESR‚Äôs $1.6 billion 2019 IPO as well as backing GLP ventures.

Public records show that OMERS currently holds a 10.2 percent stake in ESR and in 2018 Oxford teamed up with its compatriots at Vancouver-based QuadReal Property Group and other investors to back European-focused GLP funds which raised $4 billion.

More recently the firm has been pursuing multi-family investments in Australia where it has set the goal of building 5000 apartments through the Indi division of its Sydney-based Investa division.

In February this year Oxford Properties sold down some of its office holdings in Australia when Hong Kong‚Äôs Link REIT agreed to pay $428.2 million for a 49.9 percent stake in an Investa portfolio of office assets in Sydney and Melbourne.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdpbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9zdGF0ZXMvb2Rpc2hhLzIwMjIvQXVnLzIwL2ZvdXItbGVhc2Vob2xkZXJzLWZpbmVkLXJzLTEwNTEzLWNyb3JlLWZvci1leGNlc3MtYmxhY2stc3RvbmUtbWluaW5nLWluLW9kaXNoYS0yNDg5NDUyLmh0bWzSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3aW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L3N0YXRlcy9vZGlzaGEvMjAyMi9BdWcvMjAvZm91ci1sZWFzZWhvbGRlcnMtZmluZWQtcnMtMTA1MTMtY3JvcmUtZm9yLWV4Y2Vzcy1ibGFjay1zdG9uZS1taW5pbmctaW4tb2Rpc2hhLTI0ODk0NTIuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four leaseholders fined Rs 105.13 crore for excess black stone mining in Odisha,Following allegations of excess mining than the allotted volume in black granite quarries a revenue team led by tehsildar Das on Tuesday measured the actually mined area of the four mines.

ARLINGTON Va. ‚Äî The Navy has awarded Boeing a full-rate production contract for the High-Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapon Capability (HAAWC) a weapon which will allow the P-8A maritime patrol aircraft the ability to launch anti-submarine torpedoes from high altitudes.

The Naval Sea Systems Command awarded Boeing a 25.6 million ‚Äúfixed-firm-price cost-plus-fixed-fee and cost-only full-rate production contract for the production of High-Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapon Capability Air Launch Accessory (ALA) equipment related engineering and hardware repair services and other direct cost support‚Äù the Defense Department said in an Aug. 19 contract announcement.

HAAWC is an all-weather add-on glide kit that enables the Mk54 torpedo to be launched near or below the cruising altitude of the P-8A Poseidon. The kit consists of a modular ALA that strapped to a Mk54 torpedo enabling it with precision navigation to glide to a target area where the ALA separates and drops the torpedo into the water.

‚ÄúThis is an important milestone because it brings HAAWC one step closer to becoming fully operational and deployed by the Navy‚Äù said Dewayne Donley Boeing‚Äôs HAAWC program manager in a release. ‚ÄúOur solution transforms the Mk54 into a precision glide weapon in GPS-aided and GPS-denied environments. The HAAWC system provides flexibility by allowing the Navy to carry out anti-submarine operations throughout the full flight envelope of the P-8A.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are also provisions for Boeing to provide engineering such as design studies testing prototyping and/or analyses of production related issues‚Äù the Boeing release said. ‚ÄúRepair service provisions include hardware repair and maintenance services for government-owned HAAWC ALAs and associated hardware and equipment. A provision item order option also allows the Navy to procure spare hardware in support of the program.‚Äù

This contract includes options which if exercised would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $1214 million. Work is expected to be completed by September 2024.

Boeing press release

The U.S. Navy has awarded Boeing a contract for the full-rate production of the High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapon Capability or HAAWC with work expected to begin in the coming months. HAAWC is an all-weather add-on kit that enables the MK 54 torpedo to be launched near or below the cruising altitude of Boeing‚Äôs P-8A Poseidon.

‚ÄúThis is an important milestone because it brings HAAWC one step closer to becoming fully operational and deployed by the Navy‚Äù said Dewayne Donley program manager.

The contract includes production of HAAWC Air Launched Accessory or ALA kits and containers for the Navy and international customers. There are also provisions for Boeing to provide engineering such as design studies testing prototyping and/or analyses of production related issues. Repair service provisions include hardware repair and maintenance services for government-owned HAAWC ALAs and associated hardware and equipment. A provision item order option also allows the Navy to procure spare hardware in support of the program.

Carried on board the P-8A multi-mission maritime patrol aircraft the advanced weapon system will meet the Navy‚Äôs operational need to conduct anti-submarine warfare from higher altitudes and longer distances.

‚ÄúOur solution transforms the MK 54 into a precision glide weapon in GPS-aided and GPS-denied environments‚Äù Donley said. ‚ÄúThe HAAWC system provides flexibility by allowing the Navy to carry out anti-submarine operations throughout the full flight envelope of the P-8A.‚Äù

To date the global operating P-8 fleet has amassed more than 450000 mishap-free flight-hours.

The Boeing HAAWC consists of a modular Air Launch Accessory or ALA kit that attaches to a Mark 54 torpedo transforming it into a precision-guided glide weapon. At the ALA separation point the ALA deploys a stabilizer to enter the water as intended. (Boeing illustration)

Photo: Costa Verde

This is the 727 Fuselage Home  a 1965 Boeing 727 reborn as a one-of-a-kind luxury hotel. Despite its name it‚Äôs not a home or at least it‚Äôs not one anymore: back in 2013 when word about the unique conversion started making international headlines it was advertised as such. In the years since the 727 Fuselage Home has made a name for itself as one of the most fascinating and thrilling stays in Costa Rica as part of the Costa Verde resort. Airplane conversions are not unheard of though they do remain rare. Discarded aircraft provide considerable advantages in terms of converting them into homes down to the low price you can get one such fuselage for but the biggest impediment remains the fact that they‚Äôre difficult to move. In this particular case moving the 727 from the San Jose airport to its new location required five 18-wheelers and the airframe had to be broken in parts for it to happen.The Fuselage Home started out as a 1965 Boeing 727 that was once operated by South African Air and then by the Colombian Avianca Airlines. Allan Templeton who founded the Costa Verde resort came up with the idea of turning one such large aircraft into a hotel of some sorts after reading about a similar initiative in the United States. He got in touch with the guy but was disappointed to find out that he only had the idea and not actual conversions.Faced with the realization that if he wanted it he must build it himself Templeton set out to find ‚Äúnew ways to introduce convenience and luxury to this very prosaic bit of aluminum scrap.‚Äù In partnership with Faith Mulvill a former flight attendant turned real estate agent (and the owner of the 727 conversion) they arranged to buy a discarded airplane they found at the airport which was being used for fire drills.They broke it up and had it moved to its new location in the coastal rainforest between the Manuel Antonio National Park and the Pacific Ocean. The initial plan was to have it sit on its wheels but since the tires kept deflating they filled them with concrete and mounted the airframe on three pedestals over the jungle with help from a 90-ton crane. This way whoever is inside gets the feeling of flying when they look out the window. Or the closest thing to it.The 727 was stripped down  and the only elements from its old life still around are the seats in the cockpit and the cabin windows. The Fuselage Home looks more like a log cabin than an aircraft inside since it‚Äôs covered in locally-sourced hand-crafted teak which gives it a very cozy and very surprising vibe.The interior has been split in two bedrooms (one sleeps four and the other two people in queen-size beds) each with its own bathroom and its own terrace and private entrance. There are two kitchenettes and two bathrooms and a common lounge slash dining area as well as an observation deck in the former cockpit. Each terrace sits over the wings and one offers breathtaking views of the ocean.While guests can do light meal-prep in the kitchenettes inside the airplane hotel the Costa Verde resort includes four restaurants. One of them is called simply El Avion and is a shot-down Fairchild C-123 airplane. Indeed there‚Äôs a strong aviation theme happening at Costa Verde.As far as we can tell neither Mulvill nor Templeton ever disclosed the final cost of such an ambitious project but whatever it was they must have recouped it since. A night‚Äôs stay at this unique hotel with such beautiful views (they call it ‚Äúthe most exclusive hotel in Costa Rica‚Äù) comes with a price to match: $450 a day (+13% tax) in the off-season and going all the way up to 1153.50 (plus tax) a day in peak season.Making memories may be priceless but you still have to pay for it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9waWxvdHMtYm9laW5nLTczNy1ib3RoLWRvemUtb2ZmLW92ZXJzaG9vdC1haXJwb3J0LXR3by1ob3VyLWZsaWdodC0xNzM1NDM10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pilots of Boeing 737 Both Doze Off Overshoot Airport on Two-Hour Flight,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/pilots-boeing-737-both-doze-off-overshoot-airport-two-hour-flight-1735435 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9waWxvdHMtYm9laW5nLTczNy1ib3RoLWRvemUtb2ZmLW92ZXJzaG9vdC1haXJwb3J0LXR3by1ob3VyLWZsaWdodC0xNzM1NDM10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Michael Burry has made a name for himself within the investing world and beyond over the years as his bet on the subprime housing market crash was the basis for the movie The Big Short. Because of the prescience of this investment and the additional attention it garnered thanks to the movie many investors like to track Burry's portfolio moves.

His trades during the most recent quarter have certainly captured the imagination of investors. According to the latest 13F filing Burry's Scion Asset Management sold out of all of its previous holdings including the likes of Booking Holdings Bristol Myers Squibb and even his infamous Apple puts and now holds just one newly initiated position in a single controversial stock: Geo Group (GEO -0.11%).

Chump change?

Geo Group with a market cap of less than $1 billion is a company that provides private correctional detention mental health and residential treatment facilities in the U.S. and overseas. While Burry's investment in Geo Group certainly raises eyebrows here's the reason that I don't think it lives up to some of the hype it has been getting online: It's not a particularly big bet for Burry. Burry owns 500000 shares of Geo Group with a reported average purchase price of $6.60 making it about a $3.3 million position for him.

For investors like you and me this sounds like a large position but it's not a big investment as far as institutional investors or hedge funds are concerned. For example during the first quarter of 2022 before Burry sold out of all of his prior positions his portfolio was valued at $165 million. So with a $3 million investment it's not as if Burry is going all in on Geo Group.

A statement on the broader market

The small position leads me to believe that selling everything besides Geo Group is more of a way for Burry to express his view on the market itself than pound the table for Geo Group per se. Burry is known for going against Wall Street consensus and with bullish sentiment returning to the market as the major indexes have rallied off of their lows it's likely that Burry feels the market is overheated in the short term and decided to go to cash. For example he recently tweeted about the Nasdaq's recent rally and historic bear market rallies before deleting the tweet as is his modus operandi.

This isn't to say that Geo Group isn't without its merits which likely also have played some part in attracting Burry's investment. Without delving into politics the company's core business is providing private correctional and detention facilities which some investors will always shy away from. This sentiment is music to a contrarian like Burry's ears and going against the grain can lead to opportunities to acquire undervalued stocks. Geo Group trades at 15 times earnings but just 7 times next year's earnings which is far below the average market multiple.

The position could also be a directional bet by Burry. Many pundits believe that Republicans will gain control of one or both houses of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections which could lead to a return of policies that are tougher on crime. There's certainly some merit to this viewpoint and Geo Group could indeed be a beneficiary in this scenario.

Should investors follow Burry's lead?

Ultimately there are a few reasons I don't think investors need to follow Burry into this position. As mentioned above it is a fairly small stake by Burry and not a meaningful position in the grand scheme of things. Secondly looking at a five- or 10-year chart shows that shares of Geo Group have lagged the S&P 500 badly over the past decade. While shares may be getting a short-term bump the stock doesn't have a track record of creating good returns for shareholders and many investors would be better off simply investing in companies that have created long-term value.

Lastly 13F filings only show a snapshot of the previous quarter but more than six weeks into the third quarter it's possible that Burry no longer even owns this stock. With a current price of about $7.70 shares have already gained about 16% since his purchase. It's possible that Burry has already sold out and pocketed a nice gain on the stock especially given his view that the market is frothy.

I love to follow 13Fs and the moves of iconic investors as much as anyone and the stock may have its merits. But in this case I think investors would be better off doing their own due diligence and buying some long-term winners with proven track records instead of simply following Burry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWNyaXRpYy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY2F5YW1vLWNydWlzZS0yMDIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cayamo Cruise 2023 -,"Since 2008 the Cayamo Cruise -- also known as the Journey Through Song -- has brought together musicians of diverse genres for one of the most eclectic festivals at sea -- and it's back for 2023. Cayamo draws many repeat cruisers so if you're interested it's best to sign up for the pre-sale as cabins begin booking long before the lineup is announced.

General Info for Cayamo 2023

The weeklong full-charter cruise sails roundtrip from Miami February 10 to 17 2023. As part of the voyage 2394-passenger Norwegian Pearl will visit St. Maarten and Tortola.

Scoring a cabin on Cayamo is tough especially if you're a newbie. Guests from Cayamo 2022 are automatically included in the pre-sale and get first priority to book. Then bookings open for Cayamo alumni people who were placed on the most recent cruise waiting list and those who had to cancel. The last group to get pre-sale preference is new Cayamo guests. The cruise then opens to the general public for booking.

Lineup and Highlights for Cayamo 2023

The Cayamo lineup for 2023 includes a mix of folk rock alternative country bluegrass and blues artists that have made the at-sea festival a draw for more than a decade.

Listed artists include Jeff Tweedy Andrew Bird Trampled by Turtles the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band Neko Case Shovels & Rope and much more.

Cayamo is strong because of the sheer volume of performers -- many of which have small but dedicated followings -- as opposed to one star band. It's fairly common for musicians to drop in on each other's sets. Sixthman has also partnered with Black Opry to bring more diversity to the offerings.

Concerts are the main entertainment onboard but the Cayamo cruise also has special experiences for passengers such as beer tastings songwriting sessions open jams live interviews autograph signings and more.

Onboard Vibe of Cayamo 2023

The onboard vibe is mellow and fun. Cayamo draws mostly cruisers in the Baby Boomer age range who are past the hard-rocking stage of life. Expect to see people listening to music while lying down in their pool chairs as opposed to crowding the stage. Midnight jam sessions are common and they can go late but after-parties aren't necessarily packed. You're almost sure to hear some Grateful Dead covers.

Who Would Like Cayamo 2023

This sailing is ideal for American music lovers and acoustic guitar fans who like a variety of genres and are also drawn to the idea of joining a ""music family."" Many cruisers cite the friends they've made over repeated Cayamo voyages as part of the draw.

How to Book Cayamo 2023

This cruise is run by Sixthman a theme cruise operator owned by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. Bookings are done via the Cayamo website. The 2023 cruise still seems to have space as of August 2022 but act fast -- they won't last long.

Hello and apologies for barging in like a smart-alick with this long-winded reply... but it's something I've been meaning to at least get out there since EVs became mainstream (I followed from before the Model S existed)Just to add to this as I rarely see the actual torque / power graphs and specs @ rpms discussed anywhere especially since all the manufacturers have stopped posting that. But you can still get them from user generated wheel dyno graphs which basically match the curves supplied by OEM motor companies. And Tesla USED to specify that very early on when they only had the first gen Model S up to the P85D or so. I think some people might have been perplexed that power peaked at ~5000 rpm given that it spins to ~12000 rpm (then 15000 rpm and now close to 20000 rpm) but it makes sense when one studies how electric motors workSpecifically Faraday's law: fluctuating electric field (flux in the stator coils) induces a magnetic field (in the motor's magnet) and conversely fluctuating magnetic field (flux) induces an electric field. But an spinning magnet itself in the motor is again a flux that induces counter currents in the coils. That's essentially a kind of resistance called back-EMF.At some point there isn't enough voltage and current (well just current since voltage is fixed) for total power to overcome it and you have a parabolic drop in torque. The ""ideal"" situation is after reaching that maximum back-EMF after the torque drop power remains flat until redline but that is rarely the case.And since the units of power = torque x rpm it's expected otherwise all EVs would be making deep quad digit power figures if they actually had a flat torque curve!There is also peak output vs sustained output which all motors inherently have that also explains the Bashee's 15 secs powerboost feature which is similar to Porsche/Audi Taycan's 10 sec boost at a time (the quoted power figure is actually that peak 10 sec figure--the sustained power is 100 hp less) and Tesla's various modes etc.This explains why so many electrics with single gears despite big power nave relatively low top speeds.After all they DO use a reduction gear and that begs the question: why that ratio and not some other? Formula-E cars have a choice of different multi-gear manual shift transmissions up to 5 from what I recall but most teams settle on 3. Racing enthusiasts have also been using multi-gear transmissions for a long while and the Ford Electric Cobra drag car uses a traditional 3 speed automatic with manual valve body minus the torque converter.It also explains why despite very quick 0-60 they have comparatively slow 60-130 or 100-200 etc (for the same ICE peers) and lower 1/4 trap speeds for the same ETExample: from VBOX 60-130 Times MPH - DragTimes.com comparing 60-130 along with 1/4 mi. stats for cars with the same peak power figuresstock 2020 Ford GT500: 6.200 secs -- 10.480 ET @ 131.72 mph2020 Porsche Taycan Turbo S: 7.700 secs -- 10.52 ET @ 129.48 mph2016 Tesla P100D Ludicrous+ mode: 9.180 secs -- 10.418 ET @ 125.52 mph (modified with weight reduction by a couple hundreds pounds per driver in details page -- which ironically makes it the lightest car here!)(super quick to 60 most of the acceleration peaked by 1/8 mle; uses the last half of the strip to accelerate from 104 to 125)(the Plaid S is mightily impressive but we don't know about peak vs sustained output since they don't disclose that)Another comparison: Motortrend's test of the Ford's project Eliminator F-100 EV truck using the Mach-E drivetrain (480 hp) compared with the F150 hybrid turbo-V6 (430 hp)Notice the F-100 EV's speed curve compred to the F150's and what happens after 10 secsSince a picture is worth a thousand words:The concept Ford electric Cobra Jet contracted out to Cascadia Motors who used modified 4x Borg Warner motors coupled together in the front bay routed through a 3 speed transmission.Cascadia's:""Made with BorgWarner HVH250 Motor Cores""same curve here:Borg WarnerNote there are two sets of torque / power graphcs.

We recently spent a few nights at the 148-room Mandarin Oriental Boston. Mandarin Oriental is regarded as one of the world‚Äôs best luxury hotel brands though I had only ever stayed at one Mandarin Oriental property (in Kuala Lumpur) and that was years ago.

I was curious to see what the brand has to offer which is why we checked it out especially since we got a (relatively) decent deal. Mandarin Oriental‚Äôs properties in the United States are in Boston Miami New York and Washington DC.

What‚Äôs my takeaway? On the plus side the hotel has a great location large guest rooms (marketed as the biggest in the city) generally good service and a great spa (if that‚Äôs something you care about). However I also found the hotel to be forgettable and kind of soulless. The only dining outlet at the hotel is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and there wasn‚Äôt anything that really made this hotel memorable otherwise‚Ä¶ it seems like it‚Äôs just coasting on the Mandarin Oriental name.

In contrast we also stayed at the Four Seasons Boston (just down the road) and that was in a totally different league in my opinion. That hotel actually put significant effort into the guest experience. Anyway let‚Äôs get into the review.

Booking the Mandarin Oriental Boston

We had to be in Boston on certain days in early August. I don‚Äôt know what was going on in town though hotel prices were ridiculous. Like The Liberty (a Marriott Luxury Collection) was charging $878 per night the Residence Inn Boston Dedham was charging $642 per night and the Le Meridien Boston Cambridge was charging $592 per night. There was virtually no award availability anywhere as hotels were sold out of base rooms.

By comparison the Mandarin Oriental Boston was almost a bargain. The hotel was charging $995 per night (and that was for a premium room the only one that was available) with a third night free meaning we were paying ~$663 per night. I also managed to take advantage of an Amex Offers deal for our stay to save $100.

Ford booked us through the Mandarin Oriental Fan Club program which is the best way to book Mandarin Oriental stays. This offers a variety of additional perks including a room upgrade subject to availability a $100 property credit daily breakfast and more. This is almost always a better deal than booking direct through the Mandarin Oriental Fans of M.O. program.

While the stay was by no means cheap it was a relatively decent deal compared to the other options.

If you need help with a Mandarin Oriental Fan Club booking Ford is happy to help and can be reached at [email protected].

Mandarin Oriental Boston location

The Mandarin Oriental Boston is located at 776 Boylston Street in the popular Back Bay neighborhood. It‚Äôs right next to the Prudential Center as well.

Mandarin Oriental Boston exterior

This was my first time ‚Äúproperly‚Äù visiting Boston in the summer and my gosh I loved the city and in particular loved this area. Back Bay is such a pretty area to walk around with all kinds of great local restaurants and cafes. There‚Äôs even a Capital One Cafe right across the street for those looking for decent (and cheap) coffee. The hotel‚Äôs location really can‚Äôt be beat in my opinion.

Mandarin Oriental Boston entrance

The hotel was roughly a 15-minute drive from Boston Logan Airport (BOS). It‚Äôs super convenient how close the airport is to the city in Boston ‚Äî it reminds me of Miami in that sense.

Mandarin Oriental Boston lobby & check-in

We arrived at the Mandarin Oriental Boston at around 1PM and were promptly helped by the bellmen. We were directed to reception which was located inside the lobby and straight ahead. The check-in process was efficient and friendly though our room wasn‚Äôt quite ready.

Nonetheless the associate checking us in went over all the details of what we could expect during our stay. We had booked a premier king city view room and unfortunately no upgrades were available (which was totally fair as the hotel was sold out). She confirmed we‚Äôd receive a daily $120 breakfast credit (which is massive) plus a $100 credit to use at some point during our stay.

We were also welcomed by the (German) front office manager who was extremely professional and friendly and greeted us each time we entered the hotel (while he was on duty of course).

Mandarin Oriental Boston reception

The lobby has a fair bit of seating. Aside from Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen (the Gordon Ramsay restaurant attached to the hotel) this is really the only public space in the hotel to sit. I find it disappointing that the hotel doesn‚Äôt have any sort of a lobby bar or other outlet. Personally one of the things I like about a luxury city hotel is a nice bar where I can have a drink before going out for dinner but this hotel doesn‚Äôt really have that.

On the plus side the hotel does offer complimentary coffee in the lobby each morning.

While our room wasn‚Äôt quite ready when we arrived it was ready within about 30 minutes of our arrival. During that time we sat in the lobby getting some work done. I found it unprofessional that there were four people having a conference call on speakerphone in the lobby seating area. I got the sense that they were pretty senior hotel employees because they were discussing final preparations for some winter events they‚Äôre putting together for the hotel.

Anyway eventually our room was ready at which point we headed to the elevators located down the hall from reception.

Mandarin Oriental Boston premier city view room

We were assigned room #421 a premier king city view room on the fourth floor (the hotel has eight floors). Our room was the first one on the left.

Mandarin Oriental Boston hallway

At 538 square feet the room was generously sized (base rooms here are 409 square feet which is also quite big). The Mandarin Oriental recently underwent a $15 million renovation and that‚Äôs especially evident in the guest rooms which are nicely appointed.

Our room featured a long entryway with the bathroom to the right.

Mandarin Oriental Boston room entryway

The room had a king size bed with four large pillows and I found the bed comfort to be on par with Four Seasons (which is saying a lot).

The room had a wall-mounted TV plus a dresser under the TV.

At the far end of the room was a couch plus a table with two chairs. I appreciated the variety of seating options and that the table could act as either a dining table or desk.

Our room had views of Boylston Street and even though the street gets busy the sound insulation is excellent so we didn‚Äôt hear any noise in our room.

Back near the entrance was the minibar which had a Nespresso coffee machine plus a variety of food & drinks for purchase. Interestingly there was no complimentary bottled water in the room except at turndown (of course tap water is perfectly drinkable but most luxury hotels put a couple of bottles of water in rooms).

The bathroom was back near the entrance and was quite large. There was a single sink with a large mirror and then a soaking tub a walk-in shower and a toilet with a door.

Toiletries were in wall-mounted containers and were from Diptyque which I love.

There was also a box with a variety of amenities things you might need ranging from shower caps to dental kits to combs. I appreciated that this was available in the room rather than having to call down.

A couple of hours after checking in we were brought a welcome amenity consisting of a few pieces of fruit.

Wi-Fi in the room was fast and free and twice daily housekeeping was proactively offered.

Mandarin Oriental Boston Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen (breakfast)

Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen is the Mandarin Oriental Boston‚Äôs signature restaurant and the only food & beverage outlet at the hotel (other than room service). You can access the restaurant either from the street or there‚Äôs a door near the elevators in the hotel leading to it. This restaurant only opened in early 2022 so it‚Äôs still quite new.

Mandarin Oriental Boston Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen hotel entrance

Here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî a Gordon Ramsay restaurant will no doubt be popular including with locals but to me it seems like an odd fit for a Mandarin Oriental. I appreciate Mandarin Oriental‚Äôs Asian roots and I kind of wish the hotel had some sort of an Asian-inspired food & beverage outlet even if it‚Äôs just a bar with some great drinks.

Also this has nothing to do with anything but I can‚Äôt count the number of times I‚Äôve seen Gordon Ramsay at airport lounges from the British Airways Concorde Room London Heathrow to the Qantas First Lounge Los Angeles. He gets around.

The restaurant itself was quite nice and huge. One side of the restaurant had a bar area while the other side had the main dining room.

Breakfast was served at Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen daily from 6:30AM until 10:30AM and you can find the menu below.

Mandarin Oriental Boston Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen breakfast menu

I thought the menu items were surprisingly reasonably priced. Often you‚Äôll find that luxury hotels have huge markups on breakfast but I guess they‚Äôre trying to price it so that locals might consider dining here for breakfast as well. Also keep in mind that we were given a $120 daily breakfast credit which seemed ridiculously high given the price of breakfast options. Like we could‚Äôve had four omelets and four avocado toasts each morning.

Oddly there was no coffee or drink menu at all. While the hotel has barista-made espresso drinks there are no smoothies and no freshly squeezed juices (though there is cold pressed orange and grapefruit juice from Connecticut). The cappuccinos were pretty good.

Mandarin Oriental Boston Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen breakfast drinks

Over the course of our stay we tried a variety of things including the fruit bowl greek yogurt bowl three-egg omelet avocado toast smoked salmon bagel and lemon poppyseed pancakes (we don‚Äôt usually order sweets for breakfast but these were beyond good and the portion was borderline criminal).

Since we had a $100 food & beverage credit to spend we also decided to have lunch at Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen one day. You can find the lunch menu below.

This was our big meal of the day so we had the tuna tartare and the roasted baby beet salad to start.

Mandarin Oriental Boston gym

The Mandarin Oriental Boston has a 24/7 gym which can be accessed with guest key cards. This is located on the fourth floor so was just down the hall from us. The gym was quite good with a variety of modern cardio and weight equipment. It was particularly impressive when you consider that this isn‚Äôt a huge hotel ‚Äî it has ‚Äújust‚Äù 148 rooms.

Mandarin Oriental Boston spa

The Mandarin Oriental Boston‚Äôs spa is located on the fourth floor also right near where our room was. Mandarin Orientals are known for having great spas and the Boston property is known for having one of the best spas in the city.

Mandarin Oriental Boston spa

The spa at the Mandarin Oriental Boston is a total of 16000 square feet and has 11 treatment rooms. It has some pretty innovative treatments and you can find the full menu here.

Here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî maybe I‚Äôm in the minority but a nice spa in a city hotel does nothing for me. Sure I love an amazing spa at a resort with all kinds of cool features (like take a look at the spa at the Ritz-Carlton Reserve Dorado Beach) but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever really been interested in spas when visiting a city. I don‚Äôt usually have the time I don‚Äôt find it to be worth the money and for that matter I‚Äôm not usually in such a tranquil mindset when in cities.

So if you‚Äôre really into spas I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll enjoy the one at the Mandarin Oriental though that‚Äôs something that‚Äôs lost on me personally.

Mandarin Oriental Boston service

I found service at the Mandarin Oriental to generally be very good but not perfect:

The front office staff were friendly in particular the German front office manager (mentioned above); for example I saw that they had cute Mandarin Oriental branded lobsters in the lobby (presumably intended as gifts for kids kids) and they offered to give us a couple which was nice

I found the service in the restaurant to be friendly at both breakfast and lunch

At the same time a couple of times I called the operator and there was no answer which you wouldn‚Äôt expect at a luxury hotel

We had fairly limited interactions with staff ultimately due to the lack of outlets at the hotel.

Also while we didn‚Äôt have any use for it I thought MOBI the robot butler in the lobby was super cute. Apparently MOBI can deliver stuff to your room. I didn‚Äôt need anything but I was almost tempted to ask for something just so he‚Äôd make an appearance.

Bottom line

The Mandarin Oriental Boston is a newly renovated hotel in a great location with large and nicely appointed guest rooms. The hotel also has a solid gym and an allegedly great spa (though I didn‚Äôt use it). The hotel‚Äôs only food & beverage outlet is Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen which I have a hard time getting excited about at a Mandarin Oriental.

While I think this is a perfectly nice hotel I feel like there‚Äôs something missing here. You don‚Äôt have to be a hotel guest to dine at Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen or get a treatment at the Mandarin Oriental spa. I also love Mandarin Oriental being an Asian brand yet there was nothing about the experience that reminded me of that.

I tend to think that memorable hospitality happens at the margins and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs lacking here.

I‚Äôll review the Four Seasons Boston (which is a few blocks away) next. Pricing is almost identical and I feel like that hotel puts a lot more effort into the guest experience ‚Äî there‚Äôs a complimentary hotel car that will take you anywhere in the area there‚Äôs a complimentary all-day coffee shop with barista-made drinks there‚Äôs a complimentary happy hour on the weekends there are ‚Äúvaults‚Äù with unlimited free movie snacks for guests the hotel has a beautiful pool and superior gym etc. For city hotel stays those are the kinds of amenities and experiences that stand out to me.

Authorities are urging renters to be vigilant while responding to rental properties and real-estate online stressing that this is a peak season for rental scams ‚Äî which last year cost 290 reported victims in Massachusetts a total of nearly $9 million.

Just recently in Cambridge for example police reported that they helped take down a fraudulent rental property listing from Craigslist.

The rental was listed as a brand new one-bedroom apartment with a balcony in Central Square for $1800 a month. However with rental rates climbing the average rate for a one-bedroom rental in Cambridge is about $3000 a month.

A Cambridge Police detective investigated the posting determined that it was a scam and notified Craigslist and the actual leasing office of the fraud. The resident did not end up transferring any money over to the scammer.

‚ÄúWe have seen a significant increase in the amount of money being lost by people who are desperate for a good deal‚Äù said Joseph Bonavolonta special agent in charge of the FBI Boston division. ‚ÄúScammers are cashing in on renters who need to act quickly for fear of missing out and it‚Äôs costing consumers thousands of dollars and in some cases leaving them stranded.‚Äù

Nationwide last year 11578 people reported losing more than $350 million due to these types of scams a 64% increase from the previous year. In the FBI Boston division ‚Äî including Massachusetts New Hampshire Rhode Island and Maine ‚Äî 415 victims reported more than $13 million in losses a 27% jump.

One of those victims was a Rhode Island man who had responded to an online ad for a Cambridge apartment requiring the first and last month‚Äôs rent along with a security deposit. The man was told that he would not be given the keys and could not access the apartment until the $6000 check cleared the bank.

As soon as that happened he made an appointment to collect the keys but no one answered the door. After calling and texting the purported owner the victim received a text that stated ‚ÄúYou got scammed do not text this phone anymore.‚Äù

Residents and students who are looking for apartments should think twice before they send money to someone they don‚Äôt know police warn.

‚ÄúIf possible potential residents should call and verify the property is available if the property is owned by a company check their sources drive by the property and meet the property manager at the property‚Äù Cambridge Police said in a statement.

Read our ongoing coverage here and fill out this form to tell us what you want to know.

Two Maine locations that offer larger-than-average homes at lower prices made Realtor.com‚Äôs top-10 list of U.S. zip codes garnering the most interest from homebuyers visiting its website this year.

The 04062 zip code covering most of Windham a town of just over 18000 residents on Sebago Lake in Cumberland County ranked fifth. That is up from 15th last year when the town was the only Maine location to crack the top 50. The 04210 zip code of Auburn a city of just over 23200 residents in Androscoggin County ranked 10th. It made the list for the first time.

New England cities and towns dominated the top-10 zip code rankings with Nashua Derry and Hooksett New Hampshire at second fourth and eighth respectively. North Attleboro Massachusetts ranked ninth.

Brighton New York which is in the Rochester metropolitan area ranked first with Worthington Ohio at third; Bethlehem Pennsylvania at sixth; and Johnson City Tennessee at seventh rounding out the top 10.

The real estate listing service ranked 42000 zip codes by the number of unique visitors to each property on its website and how quickly homes sold from January to June. The list released on Tuesday is limited to one zip code per metropolitan area.

Auburn and Windham drew the most interest from homebuyers in the higher-priced Portland area.

The Nashua area tended to attract views from Boston homebuyers. The proportion of Boston buyers looking at Boston properties dropped almost 8 percentage points between 2021 and 2022.

Realtor.com said that while the hot zip codes are higher priced than their surrounding area they still are less expensive than Boston and offer homebuyers a deal.

Rising prices and mortgage rates this year made affordability a top concern among homebuyers. The listing service said the common themes among the zip codes were ‚Äúvalue for money‚Äù and ‚Äúrelative affordability‚Äù compared with nearby more expensive cities like Portland and Boston.

The median listing price across all of the top 10 zip codes reached $432000 in June. That was 4 percent lower than the national median of $450000. The median listing price in June in Windham was $505000 and in Auburn $267000.

Millennials were a big part of home ownership in the top-10 zip codes where 57 percent of millennials located in them owned homes compared with 51 percent nationwide. The millennials in those areas also tended to have higher incomes than their peers nationwide boosting their buying power and letting more of them own homes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL2J1c2luZXNzL2RldmVsb3Blci11bnZlaWxzLXBsYW5zLWV2ZXJldHRzLW1hc3NpdmUtZnVlbC10YW5rLWZhcm0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Developer unveils plans for Everett‚Äôs massive fuel tank farm,"Davis essentially is approaching the project as two distinct sections: a residential area at the northern corner near Sweetser Circle where apartments and ground-floor retail would be built and an industrial area through the center of the property around Beacham Street to feature warehouses as well as high-tech and life sciences manufacturing. The company envisions up to 2.4 million square feet that could be built relatively quickly under existing zoning and another 2 million square feet or more that would evolve over time with the right market conditions and zoning changes. Davis has not yet disclosed plans for the property‚Äôs waterfront area.

During the past few weeks The Davis Companies has been sharing its preliminary plans for the ExxonMobil property. The Boston-based developer recently secured an agreement to buy the heavily contaminated site ‚Äî technically several connected parcels stretching from Sweetser Circle at the intersection of routes 99 and 16 down to the Mystic River waterfront.

One of Greater Boston‚Äôs biggest developments in years is taking shape just north of the Boston city line on a sprawling 95-acre fuel tank farm in Everett.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like we‚Äôre adding an adjacent city to the City of Everett‚Äù city councilor Stephanie Martins said in an interview. ‚ÄúWe need to really balance the existing and the new in a way that is sustainable.‚Äù

Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria is among those who hope the Davis redevelopment can be the impetus to finally extend the Silver Line rapid bus service into Everett and maybe even prompt a train station to be built there. Tracks for the MBTA‚Äôs Newburyport/Rockport line traverse Everett near the ExxonMobil property but there are no stops in the city.

‚ÄúOne of the most critical components of this project is the chance for us to attract new commercial businesses and job opportunities for our residents‚Äù DeMaria said of the Davis project. ‚ÄúI also think that the size and scale of this type of development will help force the state to move forward with using federal dollars available to it for the public transit improvements that I have been advocating for over the past several years.‚Äù

The potential redevelopment of the ExxonMobil tank farm comes at a pivotal point in the metamorphosis of the section of Everett around Lower Broadway transforming it from what was widely seen as home to a gritty industrial dumping ground on Boston‚Äôs doorstep to an entertainment destination with desirable housing and high-paying tech jobs. Wynn Resorts helped kick things off by opening its gleaming $2.6 billion casino and hotel in 2019 where a Monsanto chemical plant once stood overlooking the Mystic. Wynn also bought land across Broadway (Route 99) for redevelopment and is pursuing plans for a concert-and-conference venue for one of those properties to be connected to Wynn‚Äôs Encore Boston Harbor casino by an overhead footbridge.

Meanwhile Constellation Energy put a 40-plus-acre portion of its Mystic power plant property across from the casino on the market and hopes to wrap up that sale by the end of the year. Among the potential uses for that property that are being discussed: a stadium for the New England Revolution pro soccer team owned by the Kraft Group. Constellation plans to eventually shutter the two remaining gas-fired units at the power plant in two years.

The biggest of all of these is the ExxonMobil property which has been home to some form of petroleum storage and distribution since the 1920s.

Mike Cantalupa chief development officer for Davis told the city council that the developer will seek tax incentives or other public subsidies from city and state officials to help offset environmental remediation and infrastructure costs.

‚ÄúThe first and foremost issue on the site is to clean it up and it comes at a tremendous cost‚Äù Cantalupa said. ‚ÄúWe like to think we bring creative solutions to complex problems. ... We can‚Äôt be the sole provider but we need to solve them cooperatively and with the city‚Äôs input.‚Äù

Davis officials want to start with a 1 million-square-foot first phase with three buildings ‚Äî 300 to 350 apartments in one warehouse storage in a second and advanced manufacturing in the third. (Davis is currently developing a warehouse next door rumored to be for Amazon.)

The project features two distinct sections: a residential area and an industrial area through the center of the property around Beacham Street to feature warehouses as well as high-tech and life sciences manufacturing. Perkins&Will

At full buildout Davis sees the potential for more than 4 million square feet of development taking place including apartment towers and public green space ‚Äî as well as labs and biomanufacturing in part aimed at life sciences companies headquartered a short drive away in Cambridge.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt think this is your grandfather‚Äôs industrial park ‚Äî buildings with solid block walls and you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on inside the buildings‚Äù Cantalupa said. ‚ÄúThe buildings and the architecture need to be attractive.‚Äù

Reassuring city councilors‚Äô concerns about schools and traffic could pose another challenge.

Martins for example ticked off a list of potential issues with the development on her campaign Facebook page on Wednesday.

She said a solid commitment from state officials for a new train station is imperative as is a traffic mitigation plan to address the congestion along Route 99 and the Sullivan Square rotary in nearby Charlestown. She also wants to see a new fire and police substation built in the Lower Broadway area to accommodate all the new development.

‚ÄúAnything seems better than what we have. I must say the cleanup the remediation are huge positives‚Äù Martins said. ‚ÄúBut whatever we‚Äôre bringing to the city must be done right.‚Äù

Specifically as the IR light pulse power or the IR light-induced transient temperature rise was slowly increased the amplitude of the EPSCs went from being enhanced to being suppressed. For high enough IR light power the EPSCs were reversibly and completely abolished. Meanwhile the synaptic delay was reduced monotonously as the IR light power level was increased. We also showed that a single IR light pulse suppressed the presynaptic terminal APs and Ca2+ influx in a power- or temperature- dependent manner. These observations are further interpreted below under the hypothesis that the IR light pulse accelerated the vesicular release processes downstream to the presynaptic Ca2+ influx and suppressed the presynaptic terminal APs and Ca2+ influx. Different temperature sensitivities and dynamics of the two IR light-induced processes led to the enhancement and the inhibition of EPSCs respectively.

Enhancement in EPSCs

Previous INM studies have only reported IR light-induced increase in spontaneous postsynaptic events243840. With various model systems and illumination regimes adopted it remains unclear whether or how the synapses were directly affected by the IR light illumination. In one study an increase in the spontaneous postsynaptic current amplitude and decay rate was observed although the IR light pulses were delivered to the presynaptic neuronal soma or axon not directly to the synapses38. Assuming the synapses were not directly affected by the IR light-induced temperature rises the changes in spontaneous postsynaptic currents in this case could have been caused by alterations in the membrane potential of presynaptic neurons. On the other hand if the synapses were within or very close to the IR light illuminated region24 an increase in the spontaneous postsynaptic current frequency could have been attributed to the temperature dependence of the presynaptic processes41424344.

In this study we report that pulsed IR light at lower power levels significantly enhanced the evoked synaptic transmission. Specifically the increase in EPSC amplitude the reduction in synaptic delay and the acceleration in EPSC rising phase were observed at smaller local temperature rises induced by the IR light pulse aimed at the synapses. Similar to other invertebrates such as Caenorhabditis elegans56 and Drosophila larvae57 the excitatory synapses at the crayfish neuromuscular junctions use glutamate as neurotransmitters. Glutamate receptors in both vertebrates and invertebrates are tetramers and are structurally distinct from acetylcholine receptors at vertebrate neuromuscular junctions which are pentamers. Thus the discussion here will be focused on the temperature dependence of glutamatergic receptors. Studies4158 using the calyx of Held to examine evoked transmitter release showed that when the bath temperature was raised from 22‚Äì25 ¬∞C to 35‚Äì37 ¬∞C EPSCs exhibited an increased amplitude despite a reduced presynaptic AP amplitude and duration. In the same studies raising the bath temperature also increased the miniature EPSC amplitudes by a similar percentage as that of evoked EPSCs. It was thus suggested that the temperature dependence of the AMPA receptor activity significantly contributed to the temperature-dependent synaptic enhancement. Since the temperature range studied in this report especially with higher IR light power levels is similar to those using the calyx of Held it is likely that glutamate receptors at the crayfish neuromuscular junction also responded with accelerated kinetics. However the enhancement in EPSC amplitude reported here mainly occurred when the IR light-induced temperature rise was below 30 ¬∞C. Thus the temperature-dependent enhancement of the postsynaptic glutamate receptor kinetics is unlikely to play a major role in the enhanced synaptic transmission when the rise in the local temperature was relatively low. Furthermore acceleration of postsynaptic receptor kinetics cannot generate the reduction in synaptic delay that occurred simultaneously with EPSC amplitude enhancement. Nevertheless the excitatory effects on the glutamate receptors of the crayfish neuromuscular junction were likely to be present concomitantly with but masked by the inhibitory processes (see below) under larger increases in local temperature.

During the enhancement in evoked EPSCs the synaptic delay was reduced (Figs. 2 and 3) which suggests an accelerated and more synchronous vesicular release. The enhancement occurred in a temperature range where changes in the amplitude and arrival time of the tAPs were minimal (Fig. 5). Furthermore the presynaptic Ca2+ transients recorded during the initial onset of the IR light pulse the time window when the EPSC enhancement occurred also showed no detectable change in their magnitude or their onset time (Fig. 6). Moreover the synaptic delay continued to decrease with increasing IR light power even when an inhibition of the EPSC had become significant. In the power (or temperature) range where the EPSC inhibition occurred the tAP amplitude and arrival time (Figs. 2a 3a and 5) were reduced. However the arrival time of the tAP under IR light illumination (~ 90 ¬µs) could not quantitatively account for the reduction in synaptic delay (up to 1 ms) at the same power levels. Thus the presynaptic tAPs and the Ca2+ influx cannot account for the enhancement in the evoked synaptic transmission either.

Overall these observations indicate that the IR light-induced acceleration of the presynaptic vesicular release processes59 downstream to the Ca2+ influx contributed significantly to the synaptic enhancement reported here. Specifically we propose that due to a high temperature sensitivity of the Ca2+-activated vesicular release processes the IR light pulse led to an increase in the EPSC amplitude a reduction in the synaptic delay and an acceleration in the EPSC rising phase at relatively lower power levels and local temperature rises. These enhancements in synaptic transmission should continue to be present as the IR light power increased further evidenced by the monotonous decrease in synaptic delay (Figs. 2 and 3). However this enhancement was eventually dominated by the inhibitory effects as the power and the local temperature kept increasing (Figs. 2 and 3). Model systems where one could control more presynaptic parameters such as the Calyx of Held can further entangle these temperature-sensitive processes during the Ca2+-activated vesicular release.

Inhibition in EPSCs

With increasing power levels and temperature rises the EPSCs were profoundly suppressed and eventually blocked. To the best of our knowledge there is no prior study that has reported inhibition of synaptic transmission by direct illumination of the synapse with IR light. Moreover studies using mammalian synapses typically examined the synaptic transmission in the range of room to physiological temperatures and mostly observed an enhancement of the synaptic transmission near the physiological temperature4143585960. This study reported for the first time the suppression and blocking of synaptic transmission by IR light aimed only on the synaptic terminals (Figs. 2 and 3). We observed a power-dependent suppression of tAPs (Fig. 5) and reduction in Ca2+ influx (Fig. 6). Since the Ca2+ influx is dictated by the amplitude and duration of the APs in the presynaptic terminal it is possible that the ~ 15% reduction in tAP amplitude in combination with the altered Ca2+ channel kinetics can account for the ~ 50% reduction in the Ca2+ transients. Because Magnesium Green is a low affinity Ca2+ indicator we assume the percentage reduction in the fluorescent transient amplitude is linearly correlated with the total Ca2+ influx activated by the AP train. Using the typical fourth-power relationship between the presynaptic terminal Ca2+ concentration and the neurotransmitter release a 40‚Äì50% reduction of the Ca2+ transient (Fig. 6) in theory can result in an 87‚Äì94% decrease in transmitter release which is consistent with the suppression and blocking of the evoked synaptic transmission reported here.

While the reduction in Ca2+ influx could quantitatively account for the inhibition of the evoked EPSCs it remains possible that the IR light pulse can trigger other presynaptic processes that impact the synaptic transmission and result in inhibition. The range of temperature rises studied in this report fall into a regime where the membrane fluidity of the presynaptic and vesicular membranes could potentially be altered6162. Proteins that constitute structural or functional components of the chemical synapses may also be modified by the induced local temperature rises although temperature-dependent effects on specific synaptic proteins have not been reported. It is of great interest to examine these additional factors using animal models with readily attainable mutants.

Implications

In a previous study with the same preparation we found that although a single localized IR light pulse can successfully suppress propagating axonal APs by reducing their amplitudes and duration this suppression may have little effects on the downstream synaptic transmission due to the recovery of the AP waveforms once the suppressed APs propagated beyond the illuminated regions39. Here we show that when the same IR light pulse was aimed directly at synapses the synaptic transmission could be reversibly enhanced suppressed and blocked. The results demonstrate that synaptic transmission is highly sensitive to the IR light power and the induced local temperature rises. Therefore the selection of the illuminated targets even at the subcellular levels can play a significant role in determining the outcomes of INM.

It remains to be explored how the IR light-mediated bidirectional modulation of synaptic transmission will affect mammalian synapses. It should be emphasized that the enhancement of the synaptic transmission reported here occurred mainly for an IR light pulse that raised the local temperature to below 30 ¬∞C which is lower than the mammalian physiological temperature. The suppression and the blocking of synaptic transmission occurred at local temperatures that are close to and slightly higher than the mammalian physiological temperature. Since an IR light pulse can increase the local temperature transiently beyond the physiological level without causing tissue damage6364 it would be interesting to examine the behavior of mammalian synapses when the local temperature is transiently raised from the mammalian physiological temperature similar to what will happen during in vivo INM applications11123234. In addition to INM applications the presented study also highlights the potential of pulsed IR light as a novel and convenient tool for fundamental research where transient and localized control of synaptic activity is needed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmllL2J1c2luZXNzL2lyaXNoL2xpbWVyaWNrLXNlZWtzLW9wdGlvbnMtZm9yLWxpZmUtc2NpZW5jZS1pbmN1YmF0b3ItdG8tYm9vc3Qtc3RhcnQtdXBzLzQxOTI2OTk1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Limerick seeks options for life science incubator to boost start-ups,"Early-stage small firms can get access to specialised equipment and lab space to accelerate their growth. Photo: Stevica Mrdja

Limerick City and County Council is looking to establish a life sciences innovation hub to provide lab space and other facilities to help start-ups in the mid-west.

The council has put out a request for tenders for a feasibility study to evaluate potential sites as well as producing a set of recommendations for developing the concept for the Limerick region.

The idea is to create a successful biopharma Project in Limerick city along the lines of Kinetic Labs in Waterford and The Campus in Dublin‚Äôs Cherrywood according to a tender document published earlier this month.

The facility would complement the existing regional research and development infrastructure that is already present via SSPC PMTC Shannon ABC and University of Limerick‚Äôs Health Research Institute as well as the many major multinational firms operating in the mid-west.

The council document said the incubator would help fill a gap in the science start-up ecosystem in the Limerick area by providing a bespoke space where early-stage small firms could get access to ‚Äúprohibitively expensive‚Äù specialised equipment and lab space to accelerate their growth.

‚ÄúEarly-stage life sciences entrepreneurs and researchers will be able to use the facility to help explore their ideas test them and grow their business‚Äù the document said.

‚ÄúAs part of its regular operations the hub will run regular accelerator and venture development programmes for cohorts of life sciences start-ups coaching them in entrepreneurial and scientific excellence advising them on likely routes to investment and facilitate an environment for peer learning.‚Äù

The project is on a tight timescale with tenders due in the first week of September.

Winning applicants will be expected to produce an interim report by November 18 for inclusion in an application for a Regional Enterprise Innovation Scoping Scheme grant.

The entire project is expected to take four months on a budget of up to ‚Ç¨42000.

The life sciences sector in Ireland supports 50000 jobs nationally and produces ‚Ç¨45bn in annual exports for the economy. The industry has been expanding rapidly in recent years with major capital investment by such firms as Regeneron Cook Medical Boston Scientific and Abbott.

Earlier this year Eli Lilly said it was putting ‚Ç¨400m into a new manufacturing facility in Limerick that would add 300 jobs.",,,,,,

The medication is now undergoing phase 2 clinical trials to assess its effectiveness in lupus patients.

Source: American Chemical Society

Lupus is an autoimmune disease that attacks organs and can be fatal. There‚Äôs no cure so current treatments aim to limit damage and ameliorate symptoms. Some of these therapies have to be injected some have serious side effects and many aren‚Äôt very effective.

But today scientists report they have begun phase 2 clinical trials with a pill containing a compound that in mice not only prevents lupus-like symptoms but also reverses signs of organ damage caused by the disease and prevents death.

The researchers will present their results at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2022 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person Aug. 21‚Äì25 with on-demand access available Aug. 26‚ÄìSept. 9. The meeting features nearly 11000 presentations on a wide range of science topics.

‚ÄúFew new therapies have succeeded but we believe our compound could be an effective treatment for lupus‚Äù says Alaric Dyckman Ph.D. The disease affects 5 million people worldwide according to the Lupus Foundation of America. Symptoms include rashes extreme fatigue pain inflammation and deterioration of organs such as the kidneys and heart which can lead to death.

Lupus develops when the immune system attacks the body‚Äôs tissues. Years ago researchers began suspecting that this process involved toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 8 which are cellular proteins that activate the immune system when they detect viral RNA or mistakenly identify a person‚Äôs own RNA as a threat.

‚ÄúGenetic data and evaluations of injectable treatments suggested TLR7 and 8 could be drug targets for lupus. What was missing was an ability to directly block these receptors with small molecules that could be taken orally‚Äù says Dyckman. So in 2010 he and other scientists at Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) set out to develop such compounds.

New options would be welcome since many patients don‚Äôt respond fully to current medications. The two approved therapies that were specifically developed for lupus reduce activity of specific immune system components: AstraZeneca‚Äôs anifrolumab blocks a receptor for the protein interferon while GlaxoSmithKline‚Äôs belimumab reduces the survival of white blood cells known as B cells.

Other treatments include steroids and other general immune suppressants anti-malarials anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants.

However anifrolumab and belimumab must be given by injection or infusion Dyckman notes while steroids and general immune suppressants are associated with safety concerns and were not originally designed to treat lupus.

The BMS researchers began zeroing in on a suitable alternative by screening the company‚Äôs compound collection for molecules that could block TLR7/8 signaling. The team modified the structures of the initial hits to reduce interaction with other receptors improve potency and enable oral dosing.

The resulting compound ‚Äúafimetoran‚Äù binds to the target TLRs inhibiting their operation to achieve beneficial activity. Like anifrolumab it interferes with interferon and like belimumab it controls damage from overactive B cells. It also inhibits the production of multiple proinflammatory cytokines that cause a lot of tissue damage in lupus.

‚ÄúWith afimetoran not only could we prevent the development of lupus-like symptoms in mice before their disease onset but we could actually reverse the symptoms and prevent death in animals that were days or weeks away from succumbing to the disease‚Äù Dyckman says.

‚ÄúWe hadn‚Äôt seen that reversal with other mechanisms we had evaluated so we were particularly excited about that finding.‚Äù

Dyckman says he believes the combined effects of afimetoran give it the potential to control lupus as well as or better than existing treatments and do so through an oral delivery as opposed to requiring injection or infusion.

The team also found that afimetoran combined well with corticosteroid treatments in mice. That means patients might be able to use lower doses of steroids a mainstay of lupus treatment.

Lower doses would be beneficial because steroids have side effects such as weight gain thinning bones high blood pressure and diabetes as well as an increased risk of infection.

Phase 1 clinical trials of afimetoran to evaluate safety in healthy people and shed light on the compound‚Äôs behavior in the body have been completed.

The trials showed that a low once-daily oral dose could almost completely block signaling through TLR7/8. And now a phase 2 trial to test its effectiveness in lupus patients is underway. Because of its mode of action Dyckman says it may also work in other autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis or arthritis.

BMS is testing other compounds against lupus such as deucravacitinib an oral selective tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor that is moving into phase 3 studies. Other companies are also making progress. Merck for instance is evaluating its own oral TLR7/8 blocker enpatoran in phase 2 trials.

But the crowded field doesn‚Äôt concern Dyckman. Despite intensive efforts to develop new therapies over the past several decades few have succeeded.

‚ÄúSo getting a lot of shots on goal is important‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAlso lupus is such a heterogeneous disease that it‚Äôs unlikely that any single approach will provide relief for all of the patients out there.‚Äù

Researchers have designed large two-ended molecules for this purpose but their size can pose challenges and the proteins they target need to have a binding spot. One solution could be molecular glues: small molecules that bring a target protein and enzyme together by sticking to the enzyme and changing the shape of its surface. Glues don‚Äôt require a druggable pocket in the proteins meaning more proteins can potentially be targeted. Several of these elusive molecules have been found but often by chance. Now scientists are racing to find and design more. Ultimately companies hope to develop ways to find molecular glues for any protein of interest.

In the late 1950s and very early ‚Äô60s doctors prescribed a drug as a sedative to treat morning sickness in pregnant people. Marketed as safe it was sold under numerous names in 46 countries; it‚Äôs now known most commonly as thalidomide. In 1961 it became clear that a sudden increase in infants born with severe physical abnormalities was linked to thalidomide exposure in utero. Thousands of children were born with malformed limbs and other impairments as a result of the drug.

Most countries withdrew thalidomide from their markets in 1961. Still it remained available in some places. In 1964 a doctor prescribed it as a sedative to a person with leprosy who had an inflammatory complication involving skin eruptions. Thalidomide cleared the eruptions within days.

The ability of thalidomide to treat the leprosy complication led researchers to test it on several other inflammatory and skin conditions. In 1994 researchers reported that it could interfere with the growth of new blood vessels a finding that sparked new interest in how it might be used against tumors. Thalidomide was found to be effective in treating multiple myeloma a cancer of the plasma cells in the late ‚Äô90s.

Researchers didn‚Äôt know it yet but the mechanism responsible for the congenital conditions at least in part was likely the same one that fights cancer. In fact it would be years before scientists discovered that thalidomide was a molecular glue.

The term molecular glue refers to a small molecule that sticks two proteins together. The most common type links a target protein‚Äîtypically one that causes disease‚Äîto an enzyme that causes the target to be broken down by the cell‚Äôs protein-degradation machinery.

In the body the glue molecule first binds to a type of enzyme called an E3 ubiquitin ligase altering the shape of the ligase‚Äôs surface so it can then bind to the target protein. Once all three are bound together the E3 ligase adds a chain of ubiquitin molecules to the protein; the chain acts as a signal to the cell‚Äôs protein-degradation machinery to chop up the target protein. The novelty of molecular glues is that they co-opt a natural cellular process and force an interaction between E3 ligases and proteins that might not normally bind to them. The result is the degradation of disease-causing proteins on demand.

In people given thalidomide for morning sickness the drug may have acted in several ways including causing the destruction of proteins needed for normal fetal development. It also seems able to mark for destruction proteins that play a key role in multiple myeloma hence its success in treating that disease.

Researchers first identified molecular glues in the early 1990s says Stuart Schreiber a chemical biologist at Harvard University and a trailblazer in protein degradation. Schreiber also cofounded the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and several start-ups including molecular-glue firm Magnet Biomedicine.

Schreiber wanted to determine how several natural product drugs or drug candidates were acting as immunosuppressants which can be used to prevent organ transplant rejection among other things. Jun Liu then a postdoc in Schreiber‚Äôs lab discovered that the natural products were causing two proteins to bind to each other thereby interrupting an immune-signaling pathway.

‚ÄúThese three natural products very complicated structures had these amazing mechanisms of action‚Äù says Schreiber who coined the term molecular glue first in a group meeting and then in a 1992 Cell paper (DOI: 10.1016/0092-8674(92)90158-9) to describe this phenomenon. ‚ÄúI thought Well we chemists probably won‚Äôt be able to do that‚Äù‚Äîmake molecular glues‚Äî‚Äúit‚Äôs too complicated . . . maybe it‚Äôs really a billion years of natural selection that‚Äôs required to achieve this.‚Äù

This Schreiber now says is where he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt see the future.‚Äù Because while it isn‚Äôt easy to discover molecular glues it can be done‚Äîand researchers and companies have since risen to the challenge. In the past year a wave of firms has launched or raised significant investment to develop new molecular glues. All are striving to design or discover glues that target disease-causing proteins previously considered undruggable meaning they aren‚Äôt susceptible to existing approaches for stopping them. The ultimate goal‚Äîbeing able to find a molecular glue for any protein target‚Äîmay still be far off but systematic approaches for finding glues are yielding new clinical candidates.

The rise of glues

Schreiber says that once he appreciated the huge challenge of designing molecular glues he and his colleague Gerald Crabtree devised a work-around.

‚ÄúWe said ‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt we find a binder to one protein and a binder to another protein and just chemically stitch them together?‚Äô ‚Äù he says.

Essentially they took the concept of a molecular glue‚Äîa single molecule that can join two proteins‚Äîand separated its functions into opposite ends of a larger molecule. Each end connected by a linker could be customized to recruit its own protein. When one of the proteins being recruited is an E3 ligase that destroys the other protein‚Äîakin to what molecular glue degraders do‚Äîthe bifunctional compound is known as a proteolysis-targeting chimera or PROTAC.

Such targeted protein destruction offered a significant advantage over inhibition which was the more common protein-targeting strategy. An inhibitor molecule binds to a protein preventing the protein from doing its intended action. But the inhibitor has to stay bound to that individual protein to stop its action which requires higher doses than PROTACs and could lead to higher toxicities. A PROTAC on the other hand can be used again and again. Once its target protein is destroyed it can bind to another and repeat the process.

In recent years the development of PROTACs as pharmaceuticals has boomed. Arvinas a company founded by Yale University biochemist Craig Crews has two candidates in Phase 2 trials one to treat prostate cancer and one in partnership with Pfizer to treat breast cancer. Several others including Nurix Therapeutics Kymera Therapeutics and Foghorn Therapeutics have candidates in Phase 1 mostly for cancers.

Glues versus PROTACs Credit: Adapted from C4 Therapeutics

Although PROTACs are promising their multipart nature means they are relatively big molecules which can make bioavailability a challenge. PROTACs also require the target protein to have a structural pocket for one end to bind to and not all proteins have one. Molecular glues have the potential to overcome these obstacles.

‚ÄúMolecular-glue degraders have a major advantage in that they can exploit the collective binding pocket that‚Äôs formed from bringing two protein interfaces together‚Äù says Daniel Nomura a chemical biology professor at the University of California Berkeley who cofounded Frontier Medicines and founded Vicinitas Therapeutics which target typically undruggable proteins through degradation and stabilization respectively.

‚ÄúYou may not have enough surface to bind to on either protein alone‚Äù Nomura says. ‚ÄúBut when you now bring those two proteins together via a small molecule you create enough of a pocket there to engage in enough interactions to glue those proteins together.‚Äù This strategy likely allows a broader swath of previously undruggable proteins to be targeted he notes.

No one particular moment set off this year‚Äôs ‚Äúexplosive phase‚Äù of interest in molecular glues Schreiber says. Yes new tools have moved the field forward but this is a renaissance 30 years in the making. ‚ÄúIt was not a story of anyone forgetting about the potential or not trying hard‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was a continuous activity that was like brick by brick.‚Äù

Getting unstuck

Finding an all-in-one protein connector is a huge challenge and until recently many compounds‚Äô molecular-glue properties‚Äîsuch as those of thalidomide‚Äîwere found by chance. But tweaking known molecular glues to find new and more effective versions has been a fruitful strategy.

Glues in the clinic A selection of molecular glues approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or undergoing clinical trials.

Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) stepped up its stake in the molecular-glue game in 2019 when it acquired Celgene which had marketed thalidomide since the late ‚Äô90s. The US Food and Drug Administration approved it in 1998 for a complication of leprosy and in 2006 for multiple myeloma.

Celgene also developed more potent analogs of the drug. In 2006 the FDA approved one of these lenalidomide to treat multiple myeloma. The agency approved a third even more potent analog pomalidomide as yet another multiple myeloma treatment in 2013. Building on this expertise BMS has several new glues in Phase 1 and 2 trials for conditions including multiple myeloma lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia.

BMS‚Äôs collection of new glue candidates provides something of a proof of concept for intentional glue discovery. It shows it is possible to systematically find glue candidates for clinical development.

Most companies working on glue discovery are trying to find the molecules by mixing and matching traditional drug discovery approaches. Degron Therapeutics for instance uses three distinct screening methods CEO Lily Zou says. The first called a phenotypic screen pits drug candidates against a target‚Äîin Degron‚Äôs case cancer cell lines. If a candidate is effective at killing the cancer in an E3-ligase-dependent manner the researchers identify what protein was degraded and confirm that the drug acted as a molecular glue.

This type of screen ‚Äúis similar to finding a needle in a haystack‚Äù Cristina Mayor-Ruiz an expert on targeted protein degradation at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine Barcelona says in an email. ‚ÄúYou just need to set up a cellular assay that allows you to find it.‚Äù

In its second method Degron uses mass spectrometry to identify how protein levels change when the proteins are treated with candidate glues. In this type of screen a glue is introduced to proteins in cells containing an E3 ligase component called cereblon (the same one that thalidomide targets) and in cells without it. If protein levels decrease only in the cells containing the ligase that confirms the proteins are degraded through a molecular-glue mechanism. Of the proteins that are degraded with a glue Degron focuses on targeting ones that play a key role in disease.

The third method relies on artificial intelligence to predict what protein targets may be susceptible to degradation by a glue. Degron researchers then look for a compound to serve as a glue for that target.

The truth is you can only design when there‚Äôs already something known. Markus Warmuth CEO of Monte Rosa

Other glue firms cite AI as being a key part of their discovery process. Triana Biomedicines uses a deep-learning algorithm to choose E3 ligases that will complement the proteins the firm aims to target on the basis of protein surface features. Monte Rosa Therapeutics uses an AI-powered deep neural net to identify surface features that serve as recognition signals for an E3 ligase on potential target proteins.

Although companies have a host of methods for discovering molecular glues unlike PROTACs glues so far can‚Äôt be designed and built from scratch. Researchers design PROTACs by taking two disparate ligands that each serve a purpose and chemically connecting them via a linker. A molecular glue in contrast is one tiny molecule that binds to both proteins and determining an atomic configuration that will do this is much more difficult. Some companies say they are designing rather than finding glues. But it‚Äôs often a matter of how those terms are defined.

For example Monte Rosa‚Äôs CEO Markus Warmuth considers the company‚Äôs work to fall under design. But he notes that no molecular glue can be made entirely from scratch.

‚ÄúThe truth is you can only design when there‚Äôs already something known‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúFor me it‚Äôs sort of taking a core that you know and with the input of structural information expand the chemical space in a meaningful way.‚Äù He considers this to be different from classic drug discovery which is ‚Äúmaking millions of molecules and see what sticks.‚Äù

Shanique Borteley Alabi a molecular-glue expert who was formerly at Monte Rosa agrees there isn‚Äôt a hard line that delineates discovery from design of molecular glues. ‚ÄúIf you have some type of hypothesis or you‚Äôre able to not just go fishing but use some type of structural insights to give yourself a sense of what can bind‚Äîin the world of glues I will allow for that to be called rational design‚Äù she says.

Whether or not companies can truly design molecular glues they are being given a lot of money to try. With $22 million in series A funding raised in June Degron is the latest in a surge of glue companies to launch or win investment. Triana emerged in April with $110 million; funders included Pfizer‚Äôs venture capital arm. Monte Rosa went public in June 2021 claiming the ticker symbol ‚ÄúGLUE‚Äù with a $222 million initial public offering.

Big Pharma companies are in the game as well. BMS paid the contract research firm Evotec $200 million up front in May to extend a 2018 glue collaboration for 8 more years and in June Merck KGaA struck a partnership with the Vienna-based glue company Proxygen worth up to $554 million. Some early-stage glue companies say they have cancer and inflammation in their sights as disease targets but most won‚Äôt get more specific than that.

Several molecular glues have reached clinical trials. Novartis has a candidate NVP-DKY709 in Phase 1 for advanced solid tumors. Bayer has a molecular-glue candidate (BAY 2666605) codeveloped with the Broad Institute in Phase 1 for metastatic melanoma and other advanced solid tumors. C4 Therapeutics spun out of Jay Bradner‚Äôs research at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has two candidates in Phase 1 trials‚Äîone molecular glue and one PROTAC. The glue CFT7455 is in trials for treating multiple myeloma and lymphoma and the PROTAC CFT8634 is being tested for synovial sarcoma and certain solid tumors.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt really set out to be a bifunctional degrader company or a monofunctional‚Äù says Stew Fisher C4‚Äôs chief scientific officer referring to PROTACs and glues. Rather the firm made the strategic decision to focus on cereblon the well-studied E3 ligase component and develop degraders regardless of type that are best suited to target proteins of interest.

We‚Äôre not there where I can say ‚ÄòThis is the protein; I‚Äôm going to glue it.‚Äô Shanique Borteley Alabi molecular-glue expert

Despite the growing buzz molecular glues haven‚Äôt surpassed PROTACs in clinical interest. Over a dozen PROTACs are in clinical development‚Äîsome as far as Phase 2 trials‚Äîand there are no signs that their development is slowing.

‚ÄúPROTACs are certainly modular in their design. And I think they‚Äôll stick around for a long time‚Äù says Nomura the Berkeley scientist and entrepreneur. ‚ÄúBut because of the more drug-like properties of these monovalent molecular-glue degraders if we are able to more systematically discover these things I think that will take a strong foothold in the drug discovery space.‚Äù

What‚Äôs next for glues?

Most molecular glues are designed to stick a target protein to a ligase that triggers degradation but glues could in principle stick any two proteins together. Some companies don‚Äôt want to only destroy targets so they are exploring proteins other than E3 ligases.

Generian Pharmaceuticals for instance recently teamed up with a subsidiary of Astellas Pharma to look beyond degradation. The companies are pursuing small molecules not only to degrade protein targets but also to activate and stabilize them. Generian CEO Hank Safferstein says the company has done work on stabilizing proteins that decline with age for instance.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of protein complexes that you want to ideally glue together where the end result is not degradation‚Äù Nomura says. ‚ÄúSelectively gluing together specific protein complexes over others that manipulate transcription for example . . . that‚Äôs a much more challenging problem. And I think that‚Äôs where the field is going.‚Äù

As scientists and companies continue to hone their discovery and design methods many contenders in the glue arena have their eye on the same lofty goal: an on-demand method for finding molecular glues for any protein target.

With that capability researchers could develop small-molecule drugs for any disease-causing proteins that can be glued. But it‚Äôs no simple task. Even with advances in technology and discovery approaches glues are challenging to find and they can‚Äôt be designed de novo like PROTACs. Finding a method to readily produce a glue for any disease target will be no small feat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL21pY2hhZWwtYnVycnktc29sZC1hbGwtb2YtaGlzLWhvbGRpbmdzLWFuZC1ib3VnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael Burry Sold All of His Holdings and Bought This Controversial Stock,"""The Big Short"" investor has raised a lot of eyebrows with his latest trade.

Michael Burry has made a name for himself within the investing world and beyond over the years as his bet on the subprime housing market crash was the basis for the movie The Big Short. Because of the prescience of this investment and the additional attention it garnered thanks to the movie many investors like to track Burry's portfolio moves.

His trades during the most recent quarter have certainly captured the imagination of investors. According to the latest 13F filing Burry's Scion Asset Management sold out of all of its previous holdings including the likes of Booking Holdings Bristol Myers Squibb and even his infamous Apple puts and now holds just one newly initiated position in a single controversial stock: Geo Group (GEO -0.11%).

Chump change?

Geo Group with a market cap of less than $1 billion is a company that provides private correctional detention mental health and residential treatment facilities in the U.S. and overseas. While Burry's investment in Geo Group certainly raises eyebrows here's the reason that I don't think it lives up to some of the hype it has been getting online: It's not a particularly big bet for Burry. Burry owns 500000 shares of Geo Group with a reported average purchase price of $6.60 making it about a $3.3 million position for him.

For investors like you and me this sounds like a large position but it's not a big investment as far as institutional investors or hedge funds are concerned. For example during the first quarter of 2022 before Burry sold out of all of his prior positions his portfolio was valued at $165 million. So with a $3 million investment it's not as if Burry is going all in on Geo Group.

A statement on the broader market

The small position leads me to believe that selling everything besides Geo Group is more of a way for Burry to express his view on the market itself than pound the table for Geo Group per se. Burry is known for going against Wall Street consensus and with bullish sentiment returning to the market as the major indexes have rallied off of their lows it's likely that Burry feels the market is overheated in the short term and decided to go to cash. For example he recently tweeted about the Nasdaq's recent rally and historic bear market rallies before deleting the tweet as is his modus operandi.

This isn't to say that Geo Group isn't without its merits which likely also have played some part in attracting Burry's investment. Without delving into politics the company's core business is providing private correctional and detention facilities which some investors will always shy away from. This sentiment is music to a contrarian like Burry's ears and going against the grain can lead to opportunities to acquire undervalued stocks. Geo Group trades at 15 times earnings but just 7 times next year's earnings which is far below the average market multiple.

The position could also be a directional bet by Burry. Many pundits believe that Republicans will gain control of one or both houses of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections which could lead to a return of policies that are tougher on crime. There's certainly some merit to this viewpoint and Geo Group could indeed be a beneficiary in this scenario.

Should investors follow Burry's lead?

Ultimately there are a few reasons I don't think investors need to follow Burry into this position. As mentioned above it is a fairly small stake by Burry and not a meaningful position in the grand scheme of things. Secondly looking at a five- or 10-year chart shows that shares of Geo Group have lagged the S&P 500 badly over the past decade. While shares may be getting a short-term bump the stock doesn't have a track record of creating good returns for shareholders and many investors would be better off simply investing in companies that have created long-term value.

Lastly 13F filings only show a snapshot of the previous quarter but more than six weeks into the third quarter it's possible that Burry no longer even owns this stock. With a current price of about $7.70 shares have already gained about 16% since his purchase. It's possible that Burry has already sold out and pocketed a nice gain on the stock especially given his view that the market is frothy.

I love to follow 13Fs and the moves of iconic investors as much as anyone and the stock may have its merits. But in this case I think investors would be better off doing their own due diligence and buying some long-term winners with proven track records instead of simply following Burry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvYnVzaW5lc3MvTmV3LVlvcmstQ2l0eS1hcnJpdmVzLWhvbWUtbGlmZS1zY2llbmNlcy8xMDAvaTI50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York City arrives as a home for the life sciences,"Credit: The Alexandria Center for Life Science

‚ÄúTwo reasons‚Äù says Anthony Johnson founder and CEO of the biotech start-up Kodikaz Therapeutic Solutions about the decision to launch his company at an incubator in Lower Manhattan. ‚ÄúWe knew we wanted to set up in New York City because of the burgeoning biotech scene and all of the infrastructure in place for biotech to be a success‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAlso we were the inaugural Golden Ticket winner.‚Äù

Source: CBRE Research 2021.

That Golden Ticket was issued in 2020 by BioLabs at NYU Langone the incubator offering Kodikaz free rent for a year. The award was sponsored by the big drug firm Boehringer Ingelheim.

With technology from Emory University Kodikaz is working on a system for delivering cell and gene therapy with DNA fragments. Called Zip-Code the platform enables targeted delivery of a wider variety of payloads than can be achieved using viruses and other standard delivery methods the firm says.

Kodikaz‚Äîthe name derives from the Greek word kodikas meaning ‚Äúcode‚Äù‚Äîis part of a new wave of start-ups in New York City where the vision of establishing a Cambridge Massachusetts‚Äìlike biotech center with technology from local research institutions mobilized development efforts a dozen years ago.

Now with an expanding landscape of laboratory space the Big Apple is beginning to attract entrepreneurs from elsewhere. Some start-ups are choosing the city over the well-established hubs of Cambridge San Francisco and San Diego.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs come a long way‚Äù Johnson says expressing enthusiasm for recruitment prospects in the city as Kodikaz moves forward. ‚ÄúWe want to be part of something that is actually growing. New York mirrors the growth we see in our company.‚Äù

Johnson expects his staff of 9 to expand to 25 in the next year and a half. The search is underway for larger lab space in Manhattan where such space is developing rapidly.

From center to centers

Intra-Cellular Therapies a specialist in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders moved into the city‚Äôs center of biotech activity in 2014 when it began leasing lab space in the West Tower of the Alexandria Center for Life Science a two-tower campus that Alexandria Real Estate Equities had opened in 2010. Tenants in the East Tower which had been the first to open included Eli Lilly and Company Roche and a branch of Pfizer‚Äôs Centers for Therapeutic Innovation (CTI) through which the drug firm collaborates with academic researchers.

Several real estate development companies are repurposing buildings in Manhattan as laboratories and office space for life sciences companies. One is Taconic Partners which opened the Hudson Research Center in 2017. Taconic and its partner Silverstein Properties converted six floors in a Warner Bros. film editing and processing facility‚Äîcalled the Movie Lab building‚Äîon Manhattan‚Äôs West Side. Taconic has two other sites including one on the East Side under development with partners. The firm launched a life sciences subsidiary Elevate Research Properties earlier this year.

We want to be part of something that is actually growing. New York mirrors the growth we see in our company. Anthony Johnson CEO Kodikaz

Last year Deerfield Management repurposed an office building as life science research space called Cure not far from the Alexandria Center. Janus Property and J.P. Morgan Asset Management are working on a similar facility in Harlem.

And Alexandria plans to keep building. With its two towers totaling 728000 sq. ft. (67600 m2) at nearly full occupancy the firm plans to build a third 550000 sq. ft. tower.

Outside Manhattan the 500000 sq. ft. BioBAT in the Brooklyn Army Terminal is operated by New York‚Äôs Downstate Medical Center and ELabNYC an entrepreneurship mentoring program. It began leasing lab space to biotech firms in 2008. And three real estate developers including Alexandria are bringing a total of 650000 sq. ft. of lab space to Long Island City Queens.

‚ÄúThe dramatic increase in activity in the last 5 years is directly tied to investment that the city and state made since 2016‚Äù says Maria Gotsch CEO of the Partnership Fund for New York City a nonprofit that works with New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) and the Empire State Development agency.

Gotsch points to NYCEDC‚Äôs LifeSci NYC a $500 million initiative announced in 2016 that offers tax incentives to promote investment by real estate developers as well as R&D tax credits for start-ups. New York State followed with a $620 million life sciences incentive program in 2017. NYCEDC announced an additional $500 million investment last year.

Spotlight on start-ups

Incubators supporting start-ups appeared as early as the late 1990s when the Audubon Business and Technology Center hosted by Columbia University uptown in Washington Heights opened. In 2013 Sam Sia a Columbia biomedical engineer and Christine Kovich a financial services entrepreneur launched the Harlem Biospace biotechnology incubator. But the concept has accelerated in recent years.

JLabs operated by a division of Johnson & Johnson opened on one floor of the New York Genome Center in 2018 with the help of $17 million in state funding. BioLabs a Cambridge-based company opened BioLabs at NYU Langone the next year with $5 million from LifeSci NYC and backing from NYU Langone Health Bristol Myers Squibb and other corporations. Both are in Lower Manhattan‚Äôs Hudson Square neighborhood home to Google‚Äôs new complex.

Keeping pace Alexandria has also launched an incubator venture installing the first Alexandria LaunchLabs on half a floor of the center‚Äôs West Tower in 2017. Last year Alexandria opened a LaunchLabs in partnership with Columbia University on one floor of a building owned by the university‚Äôs medical school‚Äîspace once occupied by the Audubon incubator. LaunchLabs now has operations in all the major US biotech hubs.

Managers at the incubators are enthusiastic about the unique environment for biotech start-ups in New York. ‚ÄúYou have diversity here‚Äù says Melinda Richter founder and global head of JLabs at Johnson & Johnson Innovation. ‚ÄúIf we are going to tackle the disparities of health we need to think about all communities and all communities are represented here in New York.‚Äù

Then there‚Äôs the entrepreneurial spirit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like ‚ÄòWe are going to do whatever it takes to get it done.‚Äô Never say die‚Äù Richter says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs New York.‚Äù

Biotech presents unique challenges however. ‚ÄúIn tech you give a couple of guys a couple of computers a couple hundred thousand dollars and a couple of years later they have a project they can sell to Microsoft Google or Facebook for $200 million.‚Äù Richter says. ‚ÄúIn life science when you start a new company you need specialized infrastructure you need specialized capital equipment you need special permits and licenses.‚Äù

JLabs is designed to support start-ups in all these areas‚Äîbeginning with equipped lab space according to Richter. ‚ÄúWhen you get into JLabs you can start pipetting in 24 hours‚Äù she claims. The incubator also provides networking fundraising and technical support. Each client is assigned a mentor at Johnson & Johnson called a JPal.

Other incubators provide similar space and networking amenities. Clients typically make use of dedicated and shared labs and equipment residing for an average of 2 years before moving to larger space elsewhere‚Äîa move requiring success both in research and in obtaining additional financing.

‚ÄúWe have all the tools for foundational research‚Äù says Glennis Mehra director of BioLabs at NYU Langone which hosts two floors once occupied by ImClone Systems an early New York City biotech success story. ‚ÄúThe model has proven itself in the short time we‚Äôve been open‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe have graduated four companies very successfully.‚Äù All stayed in the city taking space in the Alexandria Center Deerfield‚Äôs Cure lab space and the Hudson Research Center Mehra says.

About half the companies at BioLabs are working in traditional therapeutic areas Mehra says. Others‚Äîlike C16 Biosciences a firm pioneering sustainable alternatives to palm oil that recently moved from BioLabs into the Hudson Research Center‚Äîare active in other areas of biotech.

Applicants to the incubator go through a rigorous selection process during which they are vetted by a panel of New York University and NYCEDC representatives as well as by corporate sponsors of BioLabs. ‚ÄúI like to believe we are curating for a particular type of founder and a particular type of scientific endeavor‚Äù says Mehra herself an entrepreneur in the health-care arena. ‚ÄúI like to see someone who can articulate their proposition and sell. If you can sell me on it you can sell anyone.‚Äù

Movers

Brian Thomas executive director of Alexandria LaunchLabs at Columbia University watched developments in New York City over the past decade at his first job in the city at Pfizer‚Äôs CTI at the Alexandria Center. He came to New York after working as a researcher at various biotech companies in Cambridge for 14 years.

‚ÄúI had been trying for many years to live in New York City and could never find a job‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was really for academics and I wasn‚Äôt ready to go back and get my PhD at the time.‚Äù But he recognized the potential of a program like CTI that supports academic investigators in New York‚Äîand he made the leap.

Thomas says he went in with his eyes wide open. ‚ÄúWhat I saw very quickly was how actively the city Alexandria and the institutions were working toward making New York City as much of a hub as they possibly could‚Äù he says.

Witnessing the growth of opportunity in the city since he arrived Thomas was enthusiastic about moving to LaunchLabs at Columbia. ‚ÄúOne of the reasons I took this job is that it made so much sense to put one of these launch labs right in the middle of one of the major academic institutions that creates companies.‚Äù Most of the 10 start-ups at the incubator spun out of Columbia.

But New York City is no Cambridge Thomas says. ‚ÄúNew York will not have a central Cambridge hub presence. We should think of Manhattan as many hubs. It took me a while to get my head around that. You have to decide which part of the city you want to live in and do research in.‚Äù

Others who have witnessed developments in New York City firsthand are the leaders of companies that grew up and stayed. Sharon Mates cofounder and CEO of Intra-Cellular which launched in 2002 has seen it all.

‚ÄúWe started the company in New York because we started it with technology from Paul Greengard‚Äôs lab at Rockefeller University‚Äù Mates says. Intra-Cellular focuses on nerve cell signaling pathways elucidated by Greengard who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000. But finding a home in the city wasn‚Äôt easy.

New York will not have a central Cambridge hub presence. We should think of Manhattan as many hubs. Brian Thomas executive director Alexandria LaunchLabs at Columbia University

‚ÄúFirst of all space was extremely difficult to get‚Äù Mates recalls. ‚ÄúThe Alexandria Center didn‚Äôt exist yet.‚Äù The fledgling company lucked into Columbia‚Äôs Audubon incubator; it sublet space and then was able to rent directly.

Intra-Cellular grew and was able to move in 2014 into the West Tower of the Alexandria Center where it now has 40000 sq. ft.

The company has also expanded out of town. Its first drug Caplyta was approved for schizophrenia in 2019 and bipolar disorder in 2021. ‚ÄúWe have a whole sales force now and they‚Äôre all over the place‚Äù Mates says. ‚ÄúBut the research is maintained at the Alexandria Center. It‚Äôs a great place for the research people to be and it does give us a chance to hire people coming from the academic institutions because they all want to stay in New York.‚Äù

Kallyope named after the Greek muse presiding over poetry song and the arts and sciences moved into the Alexandria Center when the company was formed in 2015. The firm employs technologies including gene sequencing neural imaging and cellular and molecular biology to study neural and hormonal signaling between the gut and the brain. Kallyope was founded by three Columbia scientists including Richard Axel a recipient of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

‚ÄúEarly on there was some discussion of having the company launched in the Bay Area or potentially in Boston‚Äù says Nancy Thornberry Kallyope‚Äôs founding CEO and current chair of R&D. ‚ÄúBut there was a decision to stay in New York in part because the founders were there and we envisioned that they would be intimately involved in helping to guide the science particularly in the early years.‚Äù

The Alexandria Center was one of very few options at the time and perhaps the only one with a vivarium which Kallyope required for in vivo biology. The company launched with 6 employees and has grown to about 100. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve taken additional space there on four occasions‚Äù Thornberry says. It now occupies half a floor in the West Tower.

Thornberry says Kallyope identified New York City‚Äôs untapped talent pool as another advantage of setting up there rather than in Boston or one of the California hubs.

‚ÄúThere is not a lot of competition for talent and there are so many remarkable research institutions in New York City as well as so many amazing scientists and clinicians in the New Jersey pharma corridor and other places that are relatively local‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe envisioned that it would be relatively easy to recruit and that has proven to be the case.‚Äù

Kallyope has managed to keep annual employee turnover below 3% she says far lower than the churn in the major life sciences hubs.

The next wave

Some of the more recent members of the New York City biotech community have diverged from the script of launching from local research institutions though they appreciate their proximity.

Credit: Black Diamond Therapeutics

Black Diamond Therapeutics graduated last year from BioLabs at NYU Langone to the Alexandria Center. The company whose cofounders met at OSI Pharmaceuticals launched with funding from New York‚Äìarea venture capital investors and with its own technology for discovering drugs targeting allosteric mutations that drive cancer.

Black Diamond which has a candidate in Phase 1 clinical trials for non-small-cell lung cancer and glioblastoma opened its business headquarters in Cambridge in order to mix with the Boston area‚Äôs community of experienced biotech entrepreneurs. But the firm has made a long-term commitment to research in New York City according to Elizabeth Buck a Black Diamond cofounder and its chief scientific officer.

‚ÄúNew York is a smaller community for biotech but if you look at the number of academic institutions with investigators who are starting companies who are eager to collaborate the environment certainly is as rich as in the Bay Area or in Boston‚Äù Buck says.

C16 Black Diamond‚Äôs classmate at BioLabs was conceived in Cambridge where its three cofounders met and began thinking about palm oil alternatives.

The ‚Äúaccidental entrepreneurs‚Äù came to New York with their own science looking for a biotech environment less narrowly focused on therapeutics than those in Boston or the Bay Area CEO Shara Ticku says. ‚ÄúWe looked at our options and New York City became very compelling. The city and state were actively trying to build an ecosystem there. It was a really exciting growth space.‚Äù

The New York City area is also home to many of the consumer product companies C16 targets as potential customers. Ticku loves being in New York she adds and finds that many talented scientists do as well.

And just entering the JLabs incubator Linus Biotechnology a start-up spun out of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is looking forward to growing in New York City. The company which specializes in exposome research is debuting with momentum having been granted a breakthrough designation by the US Food and Drug Administration for the first exposomic biomarker for detecting autism at birth.

Linus named after Linus Pauling and the Greek mythological figure associated with musical dynamics already has two deals with major drug companies according to founder and CEO Manish Arora a professor of environmental medicine at the Icahn School.

Arora committed to New York City largely because of the diversity of the population a key to his research and one that can‚Äôt be matched even in a city like Boston. ‚ÄúI have access to a 50000-patient biobank at Mount Sinai Hospital‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn East Harlem there are the poorest recent immigrants. I have patients who have just come from Africa. You walk 10 blocks there are some of the wealthiest postcodes.‚Äù

The environment mirrors Linus‚Äôs diversity says Arora who notes that its cofounders came to the city from India Ireland and Australia.

The bottom line for Linus is much the same as it is for Kodikaz the next block over in Hudson Square: the city‚Äôs generative vibe which is especially in evidence at its venture-creating academic institutions Arora says.",,,

And with Shanahan who is exacting when it comes to receiver play there were a lot of details.

‚ÄúHe went through all the things he looks for from the start of the route to the intangibles throughout the entire play and the way they finish‚Äù Ahmad said. ‚ÄúSo as part of that exercise he definitely coached up movement skills: lower-body looseness how they moved their shoulders ‚Äî all the things that (a scout) needs to go through. I was an area scout at the time. And that drill told me that when I‚Äôm on the road I‚Äôm going to be looking for this this and this.‚Äù

Suffice to say Pearsall has the qualities Shanahan described seven years ago especially the movement skills.‚Äù

‚ÄúWilliams joined the 49ers in 2011 as an assistant in the organization‚Äôs scouting department. He spent three years (2013-15) as a pro personnel scout. Williams worked the past two seasons as a national scout after five years as an area scout.

Williams attended St. Ignatius College Preparatory in San Francisco before attending Columbia University where he played wide receiver for four years. He earned a bachelor‚Äôs degree in psychology from Columbia in 2010.

He joined the 49ers after first working in the financial industry out of college.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile Lenoir a former fifth-round pick became a starter in 2022 his true breakout came in 2023 in his third season‚Äù wrote Buday. ‚ÄúAfter recording a 60.9 PFF overall grade in 2022 Lenoir improved to 75.8 in 2023 which ranked 23rd at the position. He also lowered his passer rating allowed number from 89.0 in 2022 to 75.7 this past season.‚Äù

‚ÄúRenardo Green was the star of 49ers rookie minicamp.

He never got targeted and when he faced first-round pick Ricky Pearsall Green blanketed him particularly when playing press man-to-man coverage. Green clearly is a press-man specialist which is a value skill for a cornerback. But in OTAs Green will need to show that he can do more than play press.‚Äù

Russ Curtis a spokesperson for the nonprofit organization International Bird Rescue said the organization has also recovered sick pelicans in Southern California. Since April 20 the organization has cared for more than 235 pelicans at its wildlife rescue centers in Fairfield in the Bay Area and San Pedro in Los Angeles.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in really poor physical shape. They‚Äôre starving and they haven‚Äôt gotten enough nutrition‚Äù Curtis said in an interview with KQED. Some of the injuries are from fishing lines and hooks.

‚ÄúWhen there‚Äôs not the fishing stock that they can find they take chances around fishing piers and fishing boats and places where there are people with fishing tackle‚Äù he continued.

Sick birds have been spotted off Alameda Point in the Bay Area which is a roosting ground for brown pelicans. But many were found where people usually don‚Äôt find these stocky large seabirds. On city streets and parking lots for example. One bird in Santa Cruz attempted to walk into a bar Curtis said. The majority of pelicans at the Fairfield center came from the Monterey and Santa Cruz areas.

It‚Äôs not clear why the birds are having trouble finding food.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still a mystery‚Äù Curtis said. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt had any conclusive proof of what‚Äôs really going out in the wild right now.‚Äù

The Los Angeles Times reported there was a similar spike in malnourished brown pelicans along California‚Äôs coast in 2022 with no clear cause. International Bird Rescue reported other spikes in starving brown pelicans in 2010 and 2012.

During these prior incidents International Bird Rescue cared for pelicans for weeks.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to release them back out to an area where there is not proper fish stock for them to feed on‚Äù Curtis said. ‚ÄúThey would just rebound and probably come back into care at some point.‚Äù

While they wait for more information Curtis said wildlife rescue centers like theirs ‚Äî which rely on public donations ‚Äî are feeling a financial squeeze.

‚ÄúAt this point we‚Äôre going through about 500 pounds of fish a day just at this center and that‚Äôs about $1000 a day‚Äù he said.

Curtis said the public can help by keeping an eye out for unwell brown pelicans.

‚ÄúAs you enjoy the warm weather and you‚Äôre at the beach or along the coast if you see a pelican that‚Äôs out of place or might have a fishing line injury if you see something say something‚Äù Curtis said. ‚ÄúLet your local animal control know that there‚Äôs a bird in distress and let‚Äôs get it into care as soon as we can.‚Äù

If you see an injured or unwell pelican you can reach International Bird Rescue‚Äôs Bird HelpLine at 866-SOS-BIRD or get help by calling your local animal control.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2toYXZlbi5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy8yMDI0LzA1L2phbmV0LWwtYnJvd24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Janet L.

Inside Adele's super luxury 5 star hotel as she prepares to take over Las Vegas

Adele will enjoy the height of luxury when she takes to Las Vegas this winter to perform her long-delayed ‚ÄòWeekend With‚Äô residency concerts at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.

The 34-year-old chart-topping star is reportedly set to stay at the five star Nobu Villa part of the resort‚Äôs Nobu Hotel when performing from November.

The singer is set to perform over a three month stint - and will rack up a bill of ¬£2.7 million for the ¬£30000 per night villa.

But luckily for Adele she is not expected to pick up the tab as the hotel is being offered on a complimentary basis as part of her deal.

The Sun on Sunday claims thee singer will stay at the luxury hotel while in Las Vegas - and will also be ferried to and from her Beverley Hills mansion via private jet between show.

She will have the hotel villa on stand-by for the entirety of her residency run - with the three-bedroom space effectively a penthouse home with a patio overlooking the Las Vegas strip 10300 square-feet of space an outdoor BBQ pit and a whirlpool set in a Zen-style garden.

A source told the publication: ‚ÄúAdele is being served up the most astonishing VIP package of any artist.

‚ÄúShe will be able to order food from any Caesars restaurant as well as have a booze cabinet filled with all her desired tipples.‚Äù

Adele sparked fury back in January when she sensationally cancelled her shows at the eleventh hour.

The news broke while some fans ‚Äì who had spent thousands of pounds on air travel accommodation and tickets - were in mid-air flying across the Atlantic to attend the concerts.

Initially the finger of blame was pointed at Covid ‚Äì with reports suggesting the singer was forced to abort the concerts due to crew falling sick.

However it was later reported that Adele had thrown a tantrum over her stage design for the concert - getting stroppy over a water feature that was supposed to be a key part of the show.

A source explained back in January: ‚ÄúAdele described the pool as a ‚Äòbaggy old pond‚Äô and refused point blank to stand in the middle of it.

""The intention was to fill it with water on the set as she was lifted up on a crane-type mechanism creating the illusion she was floating on water.‚Äù

In an interview with Elle magazine this month Adele addressed the controversy - and stood by her decision to pull the plug on her shows.

She said: ‚ÄúThe first couple of months were really really hard. I was embarrassed.

‚ÄúBut it actually made my self-confidence grow because it was a very brave thing to do. And I don‚Äôt think many people would have done what I did

""I‚Äôm very proud of myself for standing by my artistic needs. There was just no soul in it.‚Äù

She added that her show will be something of a retrospective of her career so far explaining: ‚ÄúI want to tell the story of the beginning of my career to now.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really really nostalgic. It‚Äôs gonna be really beautiful. I haven‚Äôt got any bullet points obviously when I talk.‚Äù

Many companies that look like they might be on that path don‚Äôt stay Australian for long. Which for investors like Brown is disappointing. ‚ÄúWhether we‚Äôre talking animals seafood wheat grains or ... dairy et cetera for a country that‚Äôs got a pretty massive competitive advantage in actually growing this stuff the investor‚Äôs got very very few ways of participating in this industry at all‚Äù said Brown. Arnott‚Äôs the company behind Tim Tams was taken over by US multinational Campbell‚Äôs Soup in the 1990s. Credit: Natalie Boog ‚ÄúWhen we do get them they tend to get taken over.‚Äù Small fish in a big pond

One factor behind this dynamic is the fact that our export prowess in food is mainly in the form of raw agricultural commodities rather than in processed or ‚Äúvalue-added‚Äù products. Australia‚Äôs small population is another inhibiting factor: while we have the landmass to grow food in abundance 25 million mouths is not that many when compared for instance to neighbouring Indonesia that has a population of over 273 million. Airlie Funds Management founder John Sevior. Credit: Rob Homer ‚ÄúIn processed food and in branded food honestly we don‚Äôt have big brands here that are of global significance‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúWe tend obviously because of the size of our domestic market not to have economies of scale.‚Äù This married to our proximity to Asia makes Australian companies appear very attractive to global players that want to target the massive Asian market he added.

Scale comes up again with Sevior who says it counts in a ‚Äúglobal game‚Äù like manufacturing. ‚ÄúI think Australia has brands with some intangible value but the companies hadn‚Äôt built a big enough manufacturing base to be competitive globally‚Äù he said. Loading ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt really have the firepower or maybe the ambition to compete globally ... Your cost of production is never going to match.‚Äù Shouldn‚Äôt we be concerned about the number of Australian food and beverage companies that have ended up in foreign hands? Sevior says there is perhaps some patriotism behind those sentiments and doesn‚Äôt believe foreign ownership is necessarily detrimental to Australian economy or market though he acknowledged concerns about food security. Realistically however an Australian shopping basket today probably contains many more smaller-scale ‚Äòboutique‚Äô brands that are local amid a long-term shift towards health and well-being.

‚ÄúAt a local level with the paddock to plate movement people [are] just being a lot more discerning‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe largest question is how important are some of these brands how relevant are they are in people‚Äôs diets compared to what it might have been 10 or 20 years ago.‚Äù As a result Australian food giants ‚Äì while they may have market dominance and long-time brand recognition ‚Äì may be in ‚Äúa sort of sunset phase‚Äù Sevior says. ‚ÄúThere hasn‚Äôt been a lot of market capital to invest in large food and beverage companies in Australia for a long time.‚Äù Who‚Äôs next? Currently only a handful of sizeable Australian food and beverage companies remain on the ASX200 including poultry player Ingham‚Äôs Bega Cheese which in addition to dairy products owns Vegemite and Penfolds owner Treasury Wine Estates.

Brown wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a takeover bid emerges for Bega or United Malt the world‚Äôs fourth-largest barley malt supplier to the distilling and brewing industry. ASX-listed barley malt seller United Malt may be on the takeover menu. Credit: Bloomberg ‚ÄúThis is very much a personal opinion: I think [United Malt] is an absolute in the sight bull‚Äôs eye corporate target‚Äù Brown said. He also noted that mining magnate Andrew ‚ÄòTwiggy‚Äô Forrest who rescued boot maker R.M. Williams has recently been increasing his stake in Bega. Meanwhile Treasury which has a market value of around $10 billion is one of the rare examples of an Australian company that‚Äôs found global success. Brown describes the company as the ‚Äúpinnacle of Australia‚Äôs wine industry‚Äù but even the world‚Äôs biggest listed wine business isn‚Äôt immune from the threat of a takeover. ‚ÄúTreasury‚Äôs not bulletproof in terms of a takeover but certainly the way it‚Äôs managed to recover from the Chinese embargo is pretty spectacular so I think it‚Äôs not taken itself out of takeover range but certainly it would be a fairly big gulp for anybody to do‚Äù he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It can make your whole day truly. I fondly recall a day last summer when I found $9 on the floor in the parking lot of my local ice cream shop and then proceeded to pay for my ice cream with it. It made my double scoop of butter pecan on a waffle cone taste that much better.

The good news? There‚Äôs no need to pray that you stumble upon some crumbled-up cash in a parking lot to get a money-saving high. You can get the same satisfaction by saving some dollars on a cup of coffee (or latte or matcha or whatever your favorite drink is) from your local coffee shop.

Here are five ways you can score discounted or free coffee. You‚Äôre welcome!

Starbucks rewards

If you‚Äôre an avid Starbucks drinker and are not already a member of its rewards program sign up right now. It‚Äôs free.

You can later redeem those stars for free food and drinks. For instance 25 stars get you an extra shot of espresso and 150 stars get you a drink or treat (breakfast sandwich or parfait). More good news: Look forward to a free drink or food item on your birthday.

We recently spent a few nights at the 148-room Mandarin Oriental Boston. Mandarin Oriental is regarded as one of the world‚Äôs best luxury hotel brands though I had only ever stayed at one Mandarin Oriental property (in Kuala Lumpur) and that was years ago.

I was curious to see what the brand has to offer which is why we checked it out especially since we got a (relatively) decent deal. Mandarin Oriental‚Äôs properties in the United States are in Boston Miami New York and Washington DC.

What‚Äôs my takeaway? On the plus side the hotel has a great location large guest rooms (marketed as the biggest in the city) generally good service and a great spa (if that‚Äôs something you care about). However I also found the hotel to be forgettable and kind of soulless. The only dining outlet at the hotel is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and there wasn‚Äôt anything that really made this hotel memorable otherwise‚Ä¶ it seems like it‚Äôs just coasting on the Mandarin Oriental name.

In contrast we also stayed at the Four Seasons Boston (just down the road) and that was in a totally different league in my opinion. That hotel actually put significant effort into the guest experience. Anyway let‚Äôs get into the review.

Booking the Mandarin Oriental Boston

We had to be in Boston on certain days in early August. I don‚Äôt know what was going on in town though hotel prices were ridiculous. Like The Liberty (a Marriott Luxury Collection) was charging $878 per night the Residence Inn Boston Dedham was charging $642 per night and the Le Meridien Boston Cambridge was charging $592 per night. There was virtually no award availability anywhere as hotels were sold out of base rooms.

By comparison the Mandarin Oriental Boston was almost a bargain. The hotel was charging $995 per night (and that was for a premium room the only one that was available) with a third night free meaning we were paying ~$663 per night. I also managed to take advantage of an Amex Offers deal for our stay to save $100.

Ford booked us through the Mandarin Oriental Fan Club program which is the best way to book Mandarin Oriental stays. This offers a variety of additional perks including a room upgrade subject to availability a $100 property credit daily breakfast and more. This is almost always a better deal than booking direct through the Mandarin Oriental Fans of M.O. program.

While the stay was by no means cheap it was a relatively decent deal compared to the other options.

If you need help with a Mandarin Oriental Fan Club booking Ford is happy to help and can be reached at [email protected].

Mandarin Oriental Boston location

The Mandarin Oriental Boston is located at 776 Boylston Street in the popular Back Bay neighborhood. It‚Äôs right next to the Prudential Center as well.

Mandarin Oriental Boston exterior

This was my first time ‚Äúproperly‚Äù visiting Boston in the summer and my gosh I loved the city and in particular loved this area. Back Bay is such a pretty area to walk around with all kinds of great local restaurants and cafes. There‚Äôs even a Capital One Cafe right across the street for those looking for decent (and cheap) coffee. The hotel‚Äôs location really can‚Äôt be beat in my opinion.

Mandarin Oriental Boston entrance

The hotel was roughly a 15-minute drive from Boston Logan Airport (BOS). It‚Äôs super convenient how close the airport is to the city in Boston ‚Äî it reminds me of Miami in that sense.

Mandarin Oriental Boston lobby & check-in

We arrived at the Mandarin Oriental Boston at around 1PM and were promptly helped by the bellmen. We were directed to reception which was located inside the lobby and straight ahead. The check-in process was efficient and friendly though our room wasn‚Äôt quite ready.

Nonetheless the associate checking us in went over all the details of what we could expect during our stay. We had booked a premier king city view room and unfortunately no upgrades were available (which was totally fair as the hotel was sold out). She confirmed we‚Äôd receive a daily $120 breakfast credit (which is massive) plus a $100 credit to use at some point during our stay.

We were also welcomed by the (German) front office manager who was extremely professional and friendly and greeted us each time we entered the hotel (while he was on duty of course).

Mandarin Oriental Boston reception

The lobby has a fair bit of seating. Aside from Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen (the Gordon Ramsay restaurant attached to the hotel) this is really the only public space in the hotel to sit. I find it disappointing that the hotel doesn‚Äôt have any sort of a lobby bar or other outlet. Personally one of the things I like about a luxury city hotel is a nice bar where I can have a drink before going out for dinner but this hotel doesn‚Äôt really have that.

On the plus side the hotel does offer complimentary coffee in the lobby each morning.

While our room wasn‚Äôt quite ready when we arrived it was ready within about 30 minutes of our arrival. During that time we sat in the lobby getting some work done. I found it unprofessional that there were four people having a conference call on speakerphone in the lobby seating area. I got the sense that they were pretty senior hotel employees because they were discussing final preparations for some winter events they‚Äôre putting together for the hotel.

Anyway eventually our room was ready at which point we headed to the elevators located down the hall from reception.

Mandarin Oriental Boston premier city view room

We were assigned room #421 a premier king city view room on the fourth floor (the hotel has eight floors). Our room was the first one on the left.

Mandarin Oriental Boston hallway

At 538 square feet the room was generously sized (base rooms here are 409 square feet which is also quite big). The Mandarin Oriental recently underwent a $15 million renovation and that‚Äôs especially evident in the guest rooms which are nicely appointed.

Our room featured a long entryway with the bathroom to the right.

Mandarin Oriental Boston room entryway

The room had a king size bed with four large pillows and I found the bed comfort to be on par with Four Seasons (which is saying a lot).

The room had a wall-mounted TV plus a dresser under the TV.

At the far end of the room was a couch plus a table with two chairs. I appreciated the variety of seating options and that the table could act as either a dining table or desk.

Our room had views of Boylston Street and even though the street gets busy the sound insulation is excellent so we didn‚Äôt hear any noise in our room.

Back near the entrance was the minibar which had a Nespresso coffee machine plus a variety of food & drinks for purchase. Interestingly there was no complimentary bottled water in the room except at turndown (of course tap water is perfectly drinkable but most luxury hotels put a couple of bottles of water in rooms).

The bathroom was back near the entrance and was quite large. There was a single sink with a large mirror and then a soaking tub a walk-in shower and a toilet with a door.

Toiletries were in wall-mounted containers and were from Diptyque which I love.

There was also a box with a variety of amenities things you might need ranging from shower caps to dental kits to combs. I appreciated that this was available in the room rather than having to call down.

A couple of hours after checking in we were brought a welcome amenity consisting of a few pieces of fruit.

Wi-Fi in the room was fast and free and twice daily housekeeping was proactively offered.

Mandarin Oriental Boston Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen (breakfast)

Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen is the Mandarin Oriental Boston‚Äôs signature restaurant and the only food & beverage outlet at the hotel (other than room service). You can access the restaurant either from the street or there‚Äôs a door near the elevators in the hotel leading to it. This restaurant only opened in early 2022 so it‚Äôs still quite new.

Mandarin Oriental Boston Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen exterior

Mandarin Oriental Boston Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen hotel entrance

Here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî a Gordon Ramsay restaurant will no doubt be popular including with locals but to me it seems like an odd fit for a Mandarin Oriental. I appreciate Mandarin Oriental‚Äôs Asian roots and I kind of wish the hotel had some sort of an Asian-inspired food & beverage outlet even if it‚Äôs just a bar with some great drinks.

Also this has nothing to do with anything but I can‚Äôt count the number of times I‚Äôve seen Gordon Ramsay at airport lounges from the British Airways Concorde Room London Heathrow to the Qantas First Lounge Los Angeles. He gets around.

The restaurant itself was quite nice and huge. One side of the restaurant had a bar area while the other side had the main dining room.

Breakfast was served at Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen daily from 6:30AM until 10:30AM and you can find the menu below.

Mandarin Oriental Boston Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen breakfast menu

I thought the menu items were surprisingly reasonably priced. Often you‚Äôll find that luxury hotels have huge markups on breakfast but I guess they‚Äôre trying to price it so that locals might consider dining here for breakfast as well. Also keep in mind that we were given a $120 daily breakfast credit which seemed ridiculously high given the price of breakfast options. Like we could‚Äôve had four omelets and four avocado toasts each morning.

Oddly there was no coffee or drink menu at all. While the hotel has barista-made espresso drinks there are no smoothies and no freshly squeezed juices (though there is cold pressed orange and grapefruit juice from Connecticut). The cappuccinos were pretty good.

Mandarin Oriental Boston Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen breakfast drinks

Over the course of our stay we tried a variety of things including the fruit bowl greek yogurt bowl three-egg omelet avocado toast smoked salmon bagel and lemon poppyseed pancakes (we don‚Äôt usually order sweets for breakfast but these were beyond good and the portion was borderline criminal).

Since we had a $100 food & beverage credit to spend we also decided to have lunch at Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen one day. You can find the lunch menu below.

This was our big meal of the day so we had the tuna tartare and the roasted baby beet salad to start.

We enjoyed all four dishes. The menu seemed to be a bit all over the place but at least it was well executed.

Mandarin Oriental Boston gym

The Mandarin Oriental Boston has a 24/7 gym which can be accessed with guest key cards. This is located on the fourth floor so was just down the hall from us. The gym was quite good with a variety of modern cardio and weight equipment. It was particularly impressive when you consider that this isn‚Äôt a huge hotel ‚Äî it has ‚Äújust‚Äù 148 rooms.

Mandarin Oriental Boston spa

The Mandarin Oriental Boston‚Äôs spa is located on the fourth floor also right near where our room was. Mandarin Orientals are known for having great spas and the Boston property is known for having one of the best spas in the city.

Mandarin Oriental Boston spa

The spa at the Mandarin Oriental Boston is a total of 16000 square feet and has 11 treatment rooms. It has some pretty innovative treatments and you can find the full menu here.

Here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî maybe I‚Äôm in the minority but a nice spa in a city hotel does nothing for me. Sure I love an amazing spa at a resort with all kinds of cool features (like take a look at the spa at the Ritz-Carlton Reserve Dorado Beach) but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever really been interested in spas when visiting a city. I don‚Äôt usually have the time I don‚Äôt find it to be worth the money and for that matter I‚Äôm not usually in such a tranquil mindset when in cities.

So if you‚Äôre really into spas I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll enjoy the one at the Mandarin Oriental though that‚Äôs something that‚Äôs lost on me personally.

Mandarin Oriental Boston service

I found service at the Mandarin Oriental to generally be very good but not perfect:

The front office staff were friendly in particular the German front office manager (mentioned above); for example I saw that they had cute Mandarin Oriental branded lobsters in the lobby (presumably intended as gifts for kids kids) and they offered to give us a couple which was nice

I found the service in the restaurant to be friendly at both breakfast and lunch

At the same time a couple of times I called the operator and there was no answer which you wouldn‚Äôt expect at a luxury hotel

We had fairly limited interactions with staff ultimately due to the lack of outlets at the hotel.

Also while we didn‚Äôt have any use for it I thought MOBI the robot butler in the lobby was super cute. Apparently MOBI can deliver stuff to your room. I didn‚Äôt need anything but I was almost tempted to ask for something just so he‚Äôd make an appearance.

Bottom line

The Mandarin Oriental Boston is a newly renovated hotel in a great location with large and nicely appointed guest rooms. The hotel also has a solid gym and an allegedly great spa (though I didn‚Äôt use it). The hotel‚Äôs only food & beverage outlet is Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen which I have a hard time getting excited about at a Mandarin Oriental.

While I think this is a perfectly nice hotel I feel like there‚Äôs something missing here. You don‚Äôt have to be a hotel guest to dine at Ramsay‚Äôs Kitchen or get a treatment at the Mandarin Oriental spa. I also love Mandarin Oriental being an Asian brand yet there was nothing about the experience that reminded me of that.

I tend to think that memorable hospitality happens at the margins and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs lacking here.

I‚Äôll review the Four Seasons Boston (which is a few blocks away) next. Pricing is almost identical and I feel like that hotel puts a lot more effort into the guest experience ‚Äî there‚Äôs a complimentary hotel car that will take you anywhere in the area there‚Äôs a complimentary all-day coffee shop with barista-made drinks there‚Äôs a complimentary happy hour on the weekends there are ‚Äúvaults‚Äù with unlimited free movie snacks for guests the hotel has a beautiful pool and superior gym etc. For city hotel stays those are the kinds of amenities and experiences that stand out to me. Those were all lacking at the Mandarin Oriental.

What‚Äôs your take on the Mandarin Oriental Boston?"

The man in question is former Manila archbishop Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle who in recent years has been appointed to head different high offices in the Vatican an indication of his growing influence in the Catholic establishment.

Catholic Herald a London-based magazine reported that in the event of a potential resignation by Pope Francis due to his health Hungary‚Äôs Cardinal Erd≈ë a conservative canon law expert and Tagle seen as representative of the Church‚Äôs progressive group are leading contenders to become the next Pope.

Indeed the emergence of Cardinal Tagle as a ‚Äúpapabile‚Äù and of the Philippines as the country of origin of the possible successor of the ailing Pope is indicative of the direction being taken by the institution. From a ‚ÄúEuro-centric‚Äù Church it is now seen as moving toward becoming a truly internationally representative Church with greater numbers of people from the global South walking its halls of power. And within Asia the Philippines with its majority Catholic populace is emerging as a center of the Catholic faith five centuries after the arrival of the first missionaries‚Äîtraveling here with conquering armies.

This is why it is truly ironic that in the midst of the emerging hopeful news about Cardinal Tagle comes news about a more alarming development: the filing of charges by the Department of Justice (DOJ) against 16 individuals including nuns belonging to the Rural Missionaries of the Philippines (RMP) for the nonbailable offense of funding the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People‚Äôs Army.

Red-tagging of personalities and institutions linked to the Church and those of other religious denominations is nothing new. Indeed foreign missionaries have even been deported most recently in 2018 including Australian Sister Patricia Fox and Protestant missionary Adam Shaw for allegedly engaging in ‚Äúpolitical activities.‚Äù

Before the formal filing of charges against the RMP sisters the Anti-Money Laundering Council already froze three of the congregation‚Äôs bank accounts in 2019 based on testimonies of two informants claiming to be former communist rebels.

The RMP which has consistently denied being a Communist front organization has denounced the filing of charges by the DOJ calling it ‚Äúpart of worsening state repression against human rights defenders.‚Äù The Rural Missionaries is composed of religious from different orders who are devoted to ‚Äúservice to the rural poor.‚Äù In fact the group observed its 53 years of service to the country‚Äôs poorest and most powerless last Aug. 15 the very day the DOJ decided to file charges of ‚Äúterrorist financing‚Äù against them.

RMP also ‚Äúexpressed serious concerns for the safety of those charged‚Äù noting that two of them have already been thrown into prison on what it calls ‚Äútrumped-up‚Äù charges.

Lending credence to the RMP‚Äôs apprehensions has been the spate of killings of people who have either landed on the Red-tagging list or were being surveilled prior to being brought in for questioning.

Reporters who sought a copy of the DOJ resolution filed before the Iligan City Regional Trial Court were turned away with a DOJ official citing ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù as a reason for withholding the document from the public eye. And yet the DOJ has lost no time broadcasting the filing of charges against the nuns and labeling the RMP a funder of terrorist groups.

In its defense the RMP said its projects went through ‚Äúrigorous processes of selection monitoring and auditing by its respective donors such as the European Union the United Nations and many others.‚Äù RMP has assured that it has ‚Äúcomplied with requirements in securing funds for their projects including audits.‚Äù Its beneficiaries it added are those living in hard-to-reach areas mostly peasants indigenous peoples and other rural poor and that the ‚Äúdemonization‚Äù unleashed on it by government has ‚Äúnegatively affected various ministries in sustainable agriculture rural schools disaster risk reduction climate change mitigation health services defense of human rights and organic farming.‚Äù

This is a list it must be noted that contains work that is vested on government and government officials to fulfill and yet for some reason the work remains unfilled underfunded sloppily implemented or ignored completely. It seems that the biggest crime charged against the Rural Missionaries is that of stepping into the breach shaming our negligent and paranoid officials.

As for Cardinal Tagle is he aware of this long-standing harassment of church personnel and what does he from his perch as the third-highest ranking official in the Vatican intend to do about it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmVya3NoaXJlZWRnZS5jb20vbmF0dXJlcy10dXJuLXdldGxhbmQtcGxhbnRzLWZvci1lY29zeXN0ZW0taGVhbHRoLWFuZC12aWJyYW50LWN1bHRpdmF0ZWQtZW52aXJvbm1lbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NATURE'S TURN: Wetland plants for ecosystem health and vibrant cultivated environments,"Native wetland plants are among the most alluring flora individually and in wild and garden communities. Myriad winged and six to eight-legged pollinators are associated with a vast diversity of herbaceous and woody vegetation in marshes wet meadows hardwood swamps bogs and fens.

Ted Elliman long-time New England botanist and author of ‚ÄúWildflowers of New England‚Äù led a large group of enthusiasts in an introduction to Wetland Plants a few weeks ago. Participants assembled at Berkshire Botanical Garden (BBG) in Stockbridge for a classroom session devoted to the characteristics and significance of diverse wetlands with a preview of vegetation to be seen in the field on a guided tour of a Sheffield wetland. Wetlands are at their mid to late summer peak. See the map below for directions to the trail enjoyed by the class.

Lessons learned in wetlands are immediately relevant as wild habitats are increasingly diminished and lost to human schemes. Landscape and garden designers are compelled to increase biodiversity that supports pollinators in all projects no matter how small. Many outstanding wetland plants thrive in loamy beds rich in organic matter in ordinary garden conditions.

Red cardinal flowers (Lobelia cardinals) and blue lobelia aka great lobelia (Lobelia syphilitica) are magnets for hummingbirds in sun to part shade. Referring to the top-of-page photograph spotted Joe-Pye weed (Eutrochium maculatum) its deep pink umbels on stems reaching to 8 feet tall is an insect feeder in sun and part shade. Dramatic ostrich ferns (Matteuccia struthiopteris) thrive in part-shade to shade. White turtleheads (Chelone glabra) are found in sunny locations but prefer part shade.

Ted Elliman elucidated the vital ecosystem functions accomplished by intact wetlands including serving as water filtration and recharge areas where pollutants are removed and flood waters stored and discharged slowly preventing erosion. Wetlands protect the whole food chain and regenerate the food cycle‚Äôs base the micro-organisms including insects snails and worms that feed the fish that feed larger organisms including us. Wetlands provide wildlife a place to live.

When we consider all the disparaging remarks about swamps antidotes are needed. Please explore the following leads:

Through the revving sound of police escort ATVs float DJs and booming speakers revelers bedazzled with jewels covered in body paint and decked out in wigs feathers and masks danced their way through the streets.

The parade was part of Carnival Week in Provincetown an annual celebration of LGBTQIA+ life. It ran this year from Aug. 13-20 offering 17 events through the week plus the annual Carnival parade. The parade took place for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Eager onlookers lined either side of Commercial Street standing and sitting on both cliff barricades and in lawn chairs Thursday afternoon in anticipation of the parade‚Äôs start. Bike carts pedaled through the street filled with parade-goers while bubble machines blew into the street and kids ran around waving Pride flags.

Transgender artist Justin Vivian Bond is Carnival Grand Marsha(l)

Along with the traditional line of floats hundreds of onlookers and plenty of volunteers hailing from near and far the parade boasted a special grand marshal ‚Äî or ‚ÄúGrand Marsha‚Äù as transgender activist Justin Vivian Bond requested to be called.

Every Carnival parade organizers choose a grand marshal who represents the energy of the event said Stephan Hengst executive director of the Provincetown Business Guild. The Guild organizes Carnival each year and selected Bond to play the role of grand Marsha(l) this year.

‚ÄúIn addition to celebrating the Carnival parade and the history of the grand marshal they [Bond] are excited to also continue to carry on the legacy of Marsha P. Johnson who was a Black transgender writer who is credited with starting the Stonewall riots in New York City in 1969‚Äù Hengst said.

‚ÄúNot only are we looking forward to having someone like Justin Vivian Bond as our grand Marsha but we are also harkening back to our queer past and celebrating icons that are so important that we really feel everyone should continue to be aware of to know their legacy and to truly understand our queer history‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI like to think it's difficult to move forward with a movement without being able to truly understand and appreciate our past.""

While this was Hengst‚Äôs first Carnival experience there were plenty of veteran Carnival participants present for Thursday‚Äôs festivities. Andy Fagan and Joe Hawk who are from Waverly New York have been coming to Carnival for about 10 years and were dressed as ‚ÄúMother Nature‚Äù on Thursday.

Decade of anniversaries with a parade

This year was a special year however because it marked their 10-year wedding anniversary. While they‚Äôve been together for almost 20 years they were married in Provincetown and try to visit during Carnival each year.

‚ÄúEverything. It means everything to us‚Äù Fagan said of being able to visit Provincetown and be a part of the festivities through the years. ‚ÄúAnd just to be free the freedom to be ourselves and for everyone to be themselves we appreciate it so much.‚Äù

Hawk said Provincetown especially during Carnival is somewhere he and Fagan can feel community support.

""It‚Äôs fun it‚Äôs good food and relaxing it‚Äôs entertainment it‚Äôs everything"" he said. ""And it‚Äôs one of the only places on the planet where we could hold hands if we wanted to.""

Two sasquatches decked out in rainbow shorts walked in the parade as well promoting a queer music event Washashore Festival scheduled for Provincetown in early October. The sasquatches had different realms of Carnival experience ‚Äî one of them Erik Borg has been coming for about 10 years while the other Lew Gallo was experiencing his first Carnival.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve experienced it from all angles‚Äù Borg laughed. He lives in Provincetown and is one of the partners in the Provincetown Brewing Co. on Bradford Street. He and Gallo walked with a banner in the parade and handed out flyers prior to its start.

80 volunteers come from near and far

With so many floats dancers and flags it was essential that the Business Guild have enough volunteers for not just the parade but all of the events that happened during the week. And that was the job of Carnival Volunteer Coordinator Elyce Rivera who has been coming to Provincetown for about 12 years.

It‚Äôs become a family tradition for Rivera as she began bringing her kids when they were little and has continued since. She always felt a strong connection to the town and said over the last four or five years before the pandemic she‚Äôs been volunteering more and more for the parade.

This was her first year as coordinator but Rivera spent 20 years in the New York City Police Department and now is the director of security for the Jewish Community Center of Manhattan in her retirement.

‚ÄúIn my role I'm really excited to see the volunteers come back to me and tell me how much fun they had and how they just met a whole bunch of people‚Äù she said in anticipation of the event.

‚ÄúA lot of people you know believe it or not will travel alone or be here for the week by themselves and not know a single person"" Rivera said. ""And volunteering connects them to a whole group of other people that they otherwise would have never met and we wind up socializing in years to come.""

Carnival attracted about 80 registered volunteers to assist in the week‚Äôs 17 events and parade. Eight different Pride flags flew over Pride Street some of which include the lesbian flag the transgender flag the bisexual flag the bear flag the leather flag and the inclusive pride flag Hengst said.

‚ÄúNot only are we celebrating our community overall"" he said ""but we're truly celebrating the full spectrum of the queer community and bringing everyone together in Provincetown a place that we all know and we all love.

‚ÄúThat's what Carnival is all about bringing people together and having a great time.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA4L2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNlbGVicmF0aW9uLXNldHRpbmctc2FpbC1pbi1ub3ZlbWJlci13aXRoLXJlbGF4aW5nLWFtZW5pdGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Celebration Setting Sail in November with Relaxing Amenities,"In celebration of National Relaxation Day earlier this week Carnival Cruise Line announced details about the new Carnival Celebration‚Äôs amenities which include the Cloud 9 spa Loft 19 and the Serenity Adult-Only Retreat.

While one group of volunteers would typically be hard at work for Carrier Global Corporation they paused recently to help plant 1000 mangroves.

FLORIDA‚ÄôS MARINE LIFE DEPENDS ON KILLING INVASIVE FISH

Palm Beach County and The Nature Conservancy collaborated by building a tiny remnant island to an acre.

""We have a number of what we call interventions"" said Joseph Schmidt climate project manager with The Nature Conservancy. ""We've got some breakwaters. We've got some areas for oyster reefs and we've got an intertidal mangrove flat that we're planting today with volunteers from the carrier corporation.""

An elevated bird nesting island was also created.

""Essentially pulling all of these things together‚Ä¶provide different protection value and incorporating them together to create kind of a larger or more synergistic a project"" Schmidt said.

The 20-mile-long lagoon stretches from North Palm Beach to Ocean Ridge. Wildlife such as manatees green sea turtles and more than 100 species of birds call this estuary home.



And while this island is unique in its build the county built over 20 others over the last 20 years. Schmidt calls the county a pioneer.

Over the last century development and dredging dramatically altered the landscape replacing mangrove habitats and natural shorelines with seawalls and other human-made structures and they would become dead zones.

China's new-generation manned rocket which is currently under development will possess the capability to send taikonauts to the Moon by around 2030 Global Times has learned from China's state-owned space giant China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).A CASC spokesperson made the remarks to the media after the Long March 2D carrier rocket smoothly sent the remote sensing Yaogan-35 04 group of satellites on early Saturday morning which saw the country's Long March rocket series breaking its own record with 103 consecutive successful space launch missions.According to the CASC spokesperson the country's super heavy-lift launch vehicle which is also under development will receive further strengthening to become capable of sending payloads of 50 tons to the Earth-Moon transfer orbit on completion in order to support future lunar activity.CASC is also working on a series of reusable space launch and transport systems which will greatly boost the country's space shuttle capability lowering costs and empowering future development in this domain the spokesperson said per a statement the CASC provided to the Global Times.Meanwhile the US is busy preparing for the launch of the massive Space Launch System (SLS) rocket which is set to take place on the morning of August 29 [US local time] from the US Kennedy Space Center for the Artemis I mission - the first test of NASA's deep space exploration systems.The Artemis I according to the US space center will be the first in a series of missions to demonstrate NASA's ability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond.The US series' first crewed flight the Artemis III will see boots on the lunar surface no earlier than 2026 more than half a century since NASA successfully sent humans to the moon in December 1972 in the Apollo 17 mission.The US website space.com pointed out in an article on Friday that the 2026 mission is still ""highly uncertain"" given that the mission is relatively far away but NASA does have some early-stage planning for the later 2020s.The timeline for these missions depends a great deal on how much funding the agency receives from US Congress along with the technical progress of the Artemis program the report said.Even if NASA could pull off the ambitious plan it would already be a two-year delay as the US space agency has abandoned its original goal of sending humans to the moon by 2024.Drawing a comparison between the lunar manned landing plans of China and the US Chinese space experts pointed out that the US' practice of setting specific year deadlines is very rare in the industry given the complex nature of deep space exploration while China focuses more on technology readiness in a rather broad time frame going forward steadily and surely.China's crewed moon landing is more in line with scientific principles but NASA might grow more hostile against China in the space domain given the huge pressure it is facing to maintain its global leadership in moon exploration Wang Ya'nan chief editor of the Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine told the Global Times on Sunday when asked if there would be a new space race between space powers around 2030. NASA chief Bill Nelson warned in July of a new ""space race"" with China  in a groundless accusation that China wants to ""occupy the moon"" citing the lunar research base that China and Russia are co-building which he is ""very concerned about.""It is very likely that in order to meet the goals of the Artemis mission given its tight timeline NASA will further open management access of the International Space Station (ISS) to commercial space players such as SpaceX after 2024 as Russia has warned of its intention to pull out from the ISS by that year and shift focus and resources to its lunar plans Wang noted.Space observers also pointed out that as NASA is trying hard to relive its Apollo glories China is working on innovative plans to carry out its own crewed moon landing missions.Even without the new-generation manned rocket and super-heavy lift launch vehicle leading Chinese rocket scientist Long Lehao revealed in August 2021 China could use two rocket launches to send two taikonauts to the moon by around 2030.Long an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and chief designer of the Long March rockets said during a speech that China was planning to use new variants of the Long March-5 launch vehicle - the strongest member of the Long March rocket family - to carry out the manned space launch missions.Long referred to the new variant as Long March-5 DY which stands for ""dengyue"" meaning ""lunar landing"" in Chinese.Two rockets carrying a lunar lander and a next-generation manned spaceship will be launched for the mission and the two parts of the spacecraft will rendezvous and dock in near-lunar orbit before executing the landing process. The two taikonauts are expected to work on the moon's surface for some six hours according to Long. However there is no mention of a specific landing site.The new manned spaceship will then take off from the moon and carry out another docking with the orbiting module before heading back to Earth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ldGhpb3BpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtZmxlZXQtaW4tMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,African Sensation: The Ethiopian Airlines Fleet In 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ldGhpb3BpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtZmxlZXQtaW4tMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdlZWsuaW4vdGhld2Vlay9jb3Zlci8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL2FpcmNyYWZ0LWNhcnJpZXJzLXdpbGwtZGV0ZXItY2hpbmEtdmljZS1hZG1pcmFsLXItcC1zdXRoYW4tcmV0ZC5odG1s0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhld2Vlay5pbi90aGV3ZWVrL2NvdmVyLzIwMjIvMDgvMjAvYWlyY3JhZnQtY2FycmllcnMtd2lsbC1kZXRlci1jaGluYS12aWNlLWFkbWlyYWwtci1wLXN1dGhhbi1yZXRkLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aircraft carriers will deter China: Vice Admiral R.P.

This is surely a red-letter day for all Indians in general and the people in whites in particular. I was present at its keel-laying ceremony as the then vice chief and having associated with the initial stages of design and execution it is a satisfying and thrilling feeling that I have today.

Today India occupies a dominant position jutting out into the Indian Ocean sitting astride the busy lanes of communication that transit the ocean. Our long coastline of 7516km and exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of over two million square kilometres with over 72 islands and islets several deep-water major and minor ports are vital maritime assets. Ninety-five per cent of our trade by volume flows across the sea and accounts for nearly 50 per cent of our GDP. India has all the essential constituents for being a maritime power. There is however a major lacunae that exists‚Äîdomestic shipbuilding.

The Indian flagged merchant ships make up only 1 per cent of the global merchant marine and it account for just 7 per cent of our total trade. This important aspect of our maritime power needs to be strengthened. On the other hand we have done well when it comes to indigenous warship construction with almost all our ships being built in Indian shipyards and Cochin Shipyard has had the honour of building our first Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC). However there is a strong case for faster shipbuilding as at present it takes much too long.

The Navy is the primary instrument of India‚Äôs military maritime power. Taking into consideration our vast interests the Navy had formulated a maritime security strategy for ensuring secure sea comprising strategies for deterrence conflict shaping a favourable and positive maritime environment coastal and offshore security and capability development. Based on these strategies a long-term capability plan was developed. While much of this plan remains classified what has now come out in the public domain is the necessity for three aircraft carriers one each with the western and eastern fleets and one always available to fill during long periods of non-availability of one or the other aircraft carrier due to maintenance.

The maritime interests and threats have expanded largely during the recent times with rapid expansion of the Chinese navy which has already commissioned two aircraft carriers and further four at least are understood to be in the pipeline.

By any standards this is a massive capability. When considered along with the numerous large-landing ships powerful destroyers and frigates stealthy and long-range deployable submarines that have been recently commissioned or are in the pipeline it points to aggressive Chinese maritime intentions and the intent to develop a navy capable of matching or overtaking the powerful US navy.

It is well known that China has vital maritime interests in the Indo-Pacific region some of which will be in direct conflict with ours. It is against this scenario that we must look at our capability building which must cater for safeguarding our interests in the Indo-Pacific. This I believe can only be provided by developing powerful task forces centred on aircraft carriers that can exercise effective sea control in our areas of interest and deny the same to our adversaries. I am confident that our planners will take the Chinese factor seriously and incorporate necessary upgradation.

Many ask how carriers can change the war-fighting effectiveness of a maritime force. A Carrier Task Force (CTF) is a group of ships comprising one or more carriers numerous destroyers frigates and even submarines. The ships and submarines operate in various layers around the aircraft carrier based on threats and mission. The mutual support provided by the aircraft of the carrier weapons and sensors of escort units makes an impregnable protective umbrella around the force.

This can be compared to an iron fist which will parry any air surface or underwater threat and apply a massive force like a fist where required. All elements of a tactical operation‚Äîsurveillance command and control firepower‚Äîwill be available within the force for operational effectiveness. The aircraft from the carrier can be deployed for surveillance targeting and neutralising near and far air surface and underwater threats. Without the close support of integral aircraft this impregnability and the iron fist semblance will be greatly compromised.

From my experience as officer in tactical command in the Malabar Exercise of 2006‚Äîwith two US navy carriers Kitty Hawk and Enterprise each carrying about 100 aircraft and about 20 ships and submarines‚ÄîI found the Bay of Bengal too small as the surveillance and targeting capability of such a huge task force was so good and effective that it was beyond one‚Äôs imagination. Such is the capability of aircraft carriers and the need to acquire them to safeguard our maritime interests in the whole of Indo-Pacific.

In the absence of the aircraft carrier there will be no protection to surface ships beyond their individual or combined weapon capabilities which are limited and they will remain highly vulnerable to long-range attacks which can only be neutralised by carrier-borne aircraft as shore-based air will be incapable of providing any meaningful and effective close support beyond very limited ranges from the coast. Since maritime forces operate far from the coast the air protection can only be provided by carrier-borne aircraft. A case in point is the recent sinking of the Russian flagship Moskva which despite its powerful weapons was targeted by a long-range missile attack. Had there been close air support the opposing surveillance and targeting system could have been disrupted or attacked and the origin of attack neutralised.

Vikrant will be a medium-size carrier and hence the number of aircraft that it could operate would be limited compared with the large carriers. If we are serious about effective CTF our next carrier should be much larger and hopefully IAC-2 with such capabilities will graduate from the present proposal in files to the construction phase expeditiously. Vikrant and Vikramaditya our two aircraft carriers will in the short and medium term provide the carrier element to our iron fist formations and accomplish the varying maritime tasks. I am confident that the new Vikrant will outdo the exploits of its predecessor and keep our flag flying high. Jai Hind. Shano Varuna.

However the worsening economic and geopolitical situation has led to a downgrading of the cargo demand outlook and as a result container port utilisation is now projected to moderate to 70% in 2025 compared to last year‚Äôs projection of 75%. While the majority (70%) of GTO investment plans remain focussed on existing assets there has been a notable increase in the number of greenfield projects ‚Äì with CMA Terminals Hutchison and TIL all expected to add 4 mteu or additional greenfield capacity by 2026. Eleanor Hadland author of the report and Drewry‚Äôs senior analyst for ports and terminals said: ‚ÄúThe renewed appetite for greenfield projects shows improved confidence in the market outlook. However the ability of CMA Terminals and TIL to secure volume guarantees from CMA CGM and MSC gives these companies an advantage over non-carrier affiliated operators.‚Äù

Global supply chain disruption resulted in increased cargo dwell times in 2021 which generated additional storage charges lifting terminal operators‚Äô revenue growth above that which could be justified on the basis of volume recovery alone. Port congestion does not appear to have adversely impacted financial performance despite the widespread decline in productivity levels. The revenue raising mechanisms (i.e. paid-for overtime storage charges) have so far proven to be sufficient to offset the additional congestion-related operating costs. Operators also cite the continuing cost control measures implemented in response to Covid as having a positive impact on margins: ‚ÄúOnce global supply chain disruption eases which is now expected in 1H23 there is heightened risk that revenue gains will retreat as dwell times return to pre-pandemic levels‚Äù added Hadland.

Capital expenditure bounced back in 2021 rising 31% YoY but operators now face the twin challenges of longer lead time for handling equipment and rapidly rising costs. Drewry‚Äôs research also identifies that the pace of fund raising has slowed since 2020 with rising interest rates putting a brake on the market. In general favourable terminal operator financial performance has translated into robust balance sheets. With the exception of COSCO Ports and ICTSI net debt fell leading to a reduction in net gearing by 8.5 percentage points to 54.7%. Looking back at 2021 the number of companies that qualified as GTOs fell from 21 to 20 with K Line dropping out of the rankings following the sale of its US operations in 4Q20. Growth in equity-adjusted throughput for the remaining 20 companies classified by Drewry as GTOs was 7.0% marginally higher than the 6.8% growth in global port handling recorded in 2021. The leading operators handled over 48% of the global port volumes on an equity-adjusted basis stable on a like-for-like basis vs. 2020. Looking at world's Top 6 operators Maersk's APM Terminals has shot up from fourth to second place leapfrogging two Chinese state-owned conglomerates in the process (China COSCO and China Merchants). Singapore's PSA International retain top spot globally."

Most often heard and not seen the telltale call of the cuckoo is a curiously monotonous series of whistled notes ‚Äúpo po po po . . . po po po po . . . po po po po‚Äù as well as other calls.

Cuckoos belong to an avian family of only a handful of members. Three different species of cuckoos ‚Äî the mangrove cuckoo yellow-billed cuckoo and the black-billed cuckoo ‚Äîand two species of anis (pronounced AH-nee) the groove-billed anis and smooth-billed anis ‚Äî along with the greater roadrunner.

Preferred habitats for black-billed cuckoos are forests of dense deciduous trees and shrubs where they actively hunt for their favorite food ‚Äî caterpillars.

And while the range of yellow-billed cuckoo includes southern Minnesota with records in the north too chances are that any cuckoo observed here in the Northland will be the black-billed cuckoo. It‚Äôs likely that the lack of caterpillars this summer is the reason why so few cuckoos seem to be around.

About a foot long and between the size of a robin and a crow their off-white underparts brownish upperparts long tail with white tail spots black de-curved beak and red eye-ring sets this bird apart from other birds. A cuckoo‚Äôs hunchback posture when perching is distinctive too.

Cuckoos are somewhat secretive birds during their brief stay here in Minnesota but in years when caterpillar populations are especially high such as during forest tent caterpillar infestations there are often an abundance of cuckoos feasting on caterpillars.

Black-billed cuckoos consume many different species of caterpillars as well as other insects but are especially fond of caterpillars. In fact cuckoos are adapted to eating caterpillars that are adorned with protective spines which don‚Äôt bother cuckoos.

Yet while caterpillar spines tend to stick to the lining of a cuckoos‚Äô stomachs these birds periodically shed their stomach lining to rid themselves of any accumulating spines.

The nests of cuckoos are normally built of twigs in the lower parts of trees and shrubs. Because of their irregular nesting habits some eggs tend to become partially incubated during the egg-laying process before all the eggs are laid. This sometimes results in different-sized nestlings.

Also of interest black-billed cuckoos are known brood parasites although not to the extent that brown-headed cowbirds are. Cuckoos are especially known to dump eggs in other cuckoos‚Äô nests like the dump-nesting behavior of some cavity-nesting waterfowl like wood ducks.

According to the literature the black-billed cuckoo is known to have one of the shortest nesting periods of any bird known. From egg to fledging can occur in as little as 17 days. Despite this remarkably short period of time cuckoos typically raise only one brood per nesting season but will sometimes raise two broods.

The fascinating cuckoo is one of those birds that capture people‚Äôs attention whenever encountered. When they call from the tops of trees they pump their long tails a lot like phoebes do. And they fly gracefully on long pointed wings wherever they go.

A cuckoo‚Äôs feeding behavior is also interesting to note. Unlike many birds that are constantly on the move in search of food cuckoos normally sit quietly hiding in trees for long periods of time waiting for caterpillars and other insects to basically come to them.

When a caterpillar is spotted nearby the cuckoo quickly runs or hops from its hiding spot on a branch and captures the caterpillar. And like a dog shaking a rag cuckoos often shake and strike caterpillars against tree limbs to remove the spines of certain species.

Perhaps you have observed the black-billed cuckoo this summer. Or like me you‚Äôre wondering where they are this year.

And while most of North America except the western United States is black-billed cuckoo breeding territory their abundance or lack thereof is tied to the boom-and-bust cycles so common in caterpillar populations.

As such maybe next year we‚Äôll see and hear the black-billed cuckoo once again as we get out and enjoy the great outdoors.

The moth that had featured on the film‚Äôs poster was recently spotted in the garden of a couple in the UK. Confused about what it exactly was and curious to get answers Ian Williams shared a pic on social media. He and his wife apparently found three of these caterpillars devouring the shrubs in his home‚Äôs garden.

Ian tweeted three photographs calling the moths each other‚Äôs brothers and sisters. He also shared pictures of their feces lying in the mud in his garden and wrote ‚ÄúBefore you all settle down for your lunch here‚Äôs some pics of their droppings assuming that‚Äôs what they are?? I cleared the lot last night and this is what they‚Äôve left me overnight.‚Äù

These creepy caterpillars were used as a calling card by serial killer Buffalo Bill in the aforementioned psychological horror film. Netizens were absolutely amazed at seeing them.

‚ÄúJust wow!‚Äù exclaimed a Twitter user. ‚ÄúAmazing finding three super image huge‚Ä¶‚Äù another said. ‚ÄúCrikey! That‚Äôs massive!! Amazing to see thanks for sharing!‚Äù read a comment.

Ian‚Äôs wife Sharon was the first one to notice the insect while she was caring for the bushes in their garden. Ian said ‚Äú‚ÄùI was in the kitchen and I heard a scream my wife was actually cutting this bush in our garden back. That‚Äôs when we discovered it it was lucky it didn‚Äôt get cut in half.‚Äù

Dr Sarah Christofides of Cardiff University‚Äôs School of Biosciences told the BBC News ‚ÄúGenerally hawkmoths are very big moths and they‚Äôre not as common as perhaps some of the smaller ones you get.‚Äù She added that the adult death‚Äôs-head hawkmoth are incredibly beautiful and she will be really pleased and excited to spot one.

Speaking about discovering the insect Ian said that he had never seen them before and couldn‚Äôt make heads and tails of them. ‚ÄúMy knowledge of caterpillars and moths would probably fit on the back of a fag packet‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been party to all these replies now so I am now the leading authority on this moth‚Äù he jokingly added.

According to Dr Arthur Morris Research Associate at the Cardiff University these caterpillars are a very rare sight in the UK and they usually belong to the Mediterranean southern European and Northern African regions. ‚ÄúHawkmoths tend to produce very large caterpillars so when you find them it‚Äôs very certain that it‚Äôs pretty obvious that you‚Äôd got something quite unusual‚Äù he said.

The caterpillars have reportedly now disappeared somewhere in the bushes. Ian and his wife are quite disappointed with it now and hope to find them once again.

Duff Goldman has us feeling late for a very important date with his latest cake creation. He has created some amazing cakes over the years. The celebrity cake that he is most proud of took the form of R2-D2 as an homage to the droid's ""Star Wars"" creator. Fans might admire the Harry Potter-themed cake that came complete with lights and fog (via Food Network) or the interesting cakes he had at his wedding which included a meaty creation made with meatballs meatloaf lamb shawarma and mashed potatoes per People. The former ""Ace of Cakes"" host knows presentation is everything and his cakes definitely deliver. Maybe that's why he was selected to make President Obama's 2013 inauguration cake which per the Baltimore Sun was six tiers of patriotic imagery and confection fit for the leader of the United States.

But while we love a good red white and blue dessert it's Goldman's cake of the week creation that will have you smiling like a Cheshire Cat at the Mad Hatter's Tea Party while yelling ""Off with their heads!"" in the same breath.

A-Z Animals follows the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)‚Äôs nine categories of endangered animal lists. They are:

What is the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)?

The IUCN is the organization that monitors the conservation status and other ecological metrics for the world‚Äôs plants and animals. Its mission is to promote sustainable use of the Earth‚Äôs resources.Founded in 1948 in Fontainebleau France as the Union for the Protection of Nature the IUCN is the oldest global environmental advocacy group. Today headquartered in Gland Switzerland the umbrella organization collaborates with over 1000 smaller nonprofits associations and governments representing 140 countries.

How Many Species Occupy the Earth?

The IUCN monitors the world‚Äôs species which raises the question: How many species currently occupy the planet?In 2016 researchers declared their collective belief that over one trillion species currently occupy the Earth. However scientists have only observed and described about one-thousandth of one percent of them or 7 to 10 million.The typical lifespan of a species is 10 million years. However some stick around for hundreds of millions of years. For example jellyfish have lived on Earth for nearly 550 million years!

What is a Taxon?

The IUCN frequently uses the word ‚Äútaxon.‚Äù So what is it? A taxon is a group of one or more populations of a species or organism that form a unit.

What is the Red List?

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature is perhaps best known for creating the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species a detailed accounting of the world‚Äôs vulnerable and endangered species. The list started in 1964 and details at-risk taxons for both plants and animals which are separated into several categories.

How Many Animals are Currently Endangered?

You may be wondering: How many animals are endangered or what animals are endangered in 2020? For the most recent version of the list IUCN researchers and scientists evaluated 63837 species. Of that number 19817 are threatened with extinction; 3947 landed in the Critically Endangered category; 5766 qualified as Endangered and over 10000 species are listed under Vulnerable.

What is the Endangered Species Act?

Passed in 1973 the Endangered Species Act is a federal United States law designed to protect threatened and endangered species that are imperiled because of a ‚Äúconsequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation.‚Äù The goal of the act is to prevent extinction and recover species to the point where they no longer need protection.

'Masters Of Disguise' exhibit highlights art of hiding,"Biologist-turned-photographer Chien C. Lee is fascinated by animal hide and seek and wishes he could have the camouflaging abilities of a leaf-tailed gecko.

This elusive forest-dwelling lizard from Madagascar blends in so well with its environment thanks to its mottled pattern that you wouldn‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs there.

‚ÄúJust imagine all the wonderful wildlife I could see without being detected!‚Äù says Lee 50 who has spent nearly half his life photographing wildlife in the jungles of Borneo and other tropical rainforests. Born in the United States Lee is now based in Kuching Sarawak.

The self-proclaimed nature geek was in Kuala Lumpur recently to launch his latest Masters Of Disguise exhibition at the GMBB mall a wildlife photography series that zooms in on the kinds of camouflage and mimicry employed by insects reptiles birds and even plants ‚Äì with many species hailing from Sabah and Sarawak.

This new exhibition highlights how animals have remarkable adaptive capabilities and ‚Äúextravagantly detailed outfits‚Äù which are necessary in their never-ending quest for survival.

Masters Of Disguise continues Lee‚Äôs fascination for the deep jungle.

His flora and fauna-based Borneo‚Äôs Tree Of Life exhibit in KL opened in early 2021. It received an extended run at GMBB making it one of the longest-running photography shows in recent times.

Lee‚Äôs other exhibitions include Jungles (2019) Birds Of Borneo (2015) and Carnivorous Plants And Their Biotopes (2010).

His photographs have been widely used by international publications including National Geographic the Smithsonian and the BBC as well as numerous Malaysian publications.

Stay hidden stay alive

Masters Of Disguise needs visitors to keep a sharp eye and be extra patient in the gallery.

‚ÄúThis is a subject that has fascinated me for a long time. Being able to deceive your enemies or dupe another creature into helping you survive is a very clever strategy. Mother Nature is the original trickster‚Äù says Lee.

‚ÄòI really enjoy encountering these creatures when I have to double back and realise what‚Äôs actually there ‚Ä¶ that wasn‚Äôt a cute beetle after all but a spider!‚Äô says Lee. Photo: The Star/ Low Lay Phon

From the barely visible Black-Throated Lichen Spider in Sarawak that hides on the back of suspended dead leaves to the Common Potoo in Colombia a bird that mimics the posture of a tree branch these animals possess some of the most well-concealed designs in nature.

‚ÄúI really enjoy encountering these creatures when I have to double back and realise what‚Äôs actually there that wasn‚Äôt a cute beetle after all but a spider!

‚ÄúThis shows that the disguise is working and that you have entered the realms of these creatures. It‚Äôs a great honour actually‚Äù he adds.

Masters Of Disguise collects a total of 69 photographs that span 13 years of Lee‚Äôs work in Borneo and other rainforests in Sumatra South America Central America Madagascar and New Guinea.

Nearly 70% of the collection features flora and fauna species from Sabah and Sarawak. These works are accompanied by actual jungle recordings as well as scents (by OLFAC3).

The exhibition which runs until Jan 15 2023 is presented in a darkroom setting at GMBB. Visitors entering the room can enjoy the ‚Äúatmospheric feel‚Äù of the exhibition.

There‚Äôs even a cool interactive feature that shows what these creatures actually look like when they are not camouflaged.

Into the jungle

Knowing your way around the jungle is a big help.

Lee who moved to Kuching in 1996 has spent the better part of the past 25 years deep in the Bornean rainforests.

His tip in finding these camouflaged creatures is to look for them in the night. These animals which hide during the day are active at night and can be found lurking about.

Lee‚Äôs tip in finding these camouflaged creatures? Try looking for them at night. Photo: The Star/ Low Lay Phon

The photographer mentions there are useful and basic methods to track down these natural tricksters.

‚ÄúIf you know where they are at night just return the next morning and you will be able to find them nearby but now concealed‚Äù says Lee who has a biology degree from University of California.

‚ÄúAnother key element is learning about your subject as much as possible. Being able to understand the story behind these creatures is what makes the photography have depth to it‚Äù he adds.

Throughout the exhibition Lee‚Äôs photographs turn the spotlight on woodland creatures (mostly insects spiders and invertebrates) which go to great lengths ‚Äì from background matching disruptive colouration masquerading and aggressive mimicry ‚Äì to keep from being eaten.

Even for someone as experienced as Lee a professional wildlife photographer since 2003 coming across these animals in disguise in the wild was no easy task.

‚ÄúI must have walked by millions of these creatures and never noticed them‚Äù says Lee.

When you eventually find them he adds there is a sense of satisfaction.

‚ÄúThe more clever the disguise the more rewarding it is when you figure out what it is‚Äù he points out.

Learning experience

There is no doubt that Masters Of Disguise has a strong visual appeal but Lee‚Äôs well-researched exhibition notes are equally important for an insightful gallery experience here.

One of the highlights of Masters Of Disguise is the Moss Mimic Stick Insect which was photographed in January this year at Cartago Costa Rica. The photograph shows the intricately camouflaged almost unnoticeable species of the stick insect endemic to the mossy cloud forests of Central America.

The best way to ward off would-be predators? Look like a snake. This fruit-piercing moth caterpillar from Sarawak‚Äôs Mulu National Park has large fake snake eye spots at the one end of its body. Photo: Chien C. Lee

‚ÄúThis is a species that I have wanted to see for 30 years. We spent weeks in Costa Rica looking for this insect and on the very last night I finally found one. It‚Äôs something so elaborately camouflaged it‚Äôs a real treasure to be able to look at its intricacies. Now I can finally tick it off from my bucket list‚Äù shares Lee excitedly.

A more curious and bizarre piece is a photograph of a slug moth caterpillar taken at Matang Sarawak in August last year. This rare stingless species has a pure white colour and its softly textured tubercles bear a striking resemblance to the filaments of a deadly fungus.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not fluent in the different types of things in the rainforest you may not even realise that it‚Äôs a caterpillar. But when you realise what exactly it‚Äôs mimicking that really adds a lot of meaning to its methods.

‚ÄúMy hypothesis is that it‚Äôs mimicking or has an adaptive resemblance to a spider that has been devoured by a pathogenic fungus. It‚Äôs certainly an advantageous look-alike because animals wouldn‚Äôt want to eat this fungus-ridden spider and the caterpillar looks just like it. This caterpillar has one of the most interesting mimicry (methods) that I have ever seen‚Äù elaborates Lee.

While photographing rare and exotic wildlife is part of Lee‚Äôs job he admits that these deceptive creatures have also deepened his knowledge of the natural world.

‚ÄúWhen we look at a camouflage or mimicry in nature we can‚Äôt help but look at it from our perspective. But what we need to understand is that we‚Äôre not the target audience. We are not the predator. They are trying to fool something else completely with a different set of skills than us.

‚ÄúAnd whenever we try to understand more about these deceptions and their astounding intricacies we better understand the roles of sensory perception biological evolution and the web that connects all living things‚Äù concludes Lee.

Some of the restaurant's old customers have returned but only a small fraction according to its owner.

""It's not even half of the number we used to have"" said owner Shaosi Wang who is reducing staffing by a third closing the restaurant on some days and even considering leaving downtown.

The picture is similar at Board N Brew Cafe a board game caf√© on 103rd Street south of 100th Avenue.

Graeme Ly one of the caf√©'s owners said the drop in traffic has been ""quite drastic"" and he too has been cutting back on staff and closing the caf√© one day a week.

""Even with the help from the government a lot of us are just surviving"" he said.

Many local businesses hoped workers would return to downtown after two years of remote work but vacancy rates in the core remain high and multiple commercial real estate experts told CBC News they aren't expecting that to change soon.

Recent market reports from Colliers CBRE and NAI Commercial Real Estate all describe the vacancy rate in downtown Edmonton as high: between 11 and 22 per cent.

According to CBRE's figures on the Edmonton office market several downtown landlords are offering ""aggressive incentives"" such as early occupancy and higher tenant improvement allowances in buildings with high vacancy.

NAI Commercial's second quarter market report called the office vacancy rate ""the thorn among Edmonton real estate roses"" particularly in the downtown area.

The Edmonton Downtown Business Association predicted most workers would be back in the office by July but the reports from Colliers and NAI Commercial both said that return hasn't happened as quickly as expected.

""The mindset of the employee is they really do prefer at least some form of their work-life being remote and I think the numbers speak to that"" said Chad Snow NAI Commercial's president.

Jeff Simkin a senior vice-president with CRBE in Edmonton said there is a correlation between companies' size and whether they offer hybrid work arrangements.

Simkin said the city's suburban market which has been relatively strong is primarily characterized by local and regional tenants.

""In downtown there's a higher concentration of national and global tenants and many of those companies do have a hybrid model in place"" he said.

Edmonton part of national trend

Edmonton isn't the only Canadian city where the suburban office market is outperforming the downtown one.

CRBE's most recent national report on office markets found that downtown centres are increasingly lagging behind suburban markets.

""This is the second consecutive quarter where the suburbs posted a lower national vacancy relative to downtown centres something previously never seen in the Canadian office market"" the report said.

According to CRBE's data the downtown vacancy rate was higher than the suburban one in Edmonton Winnipeg Halifax London Ottawa Vancouver the Waterloo region and Calgary.

Looking ahead

Some market-watchers predict the vacancy rate will continue to increase in downtown Edmonton as employers who may have been locked into three-to-five-year leases during the pandemic reach the end of those contracts.

Simkin said he expects more national tenants will implement a hybrid work model reducing their footprint downtown and some financial institutions may start subletting space in the core.

Others see signs of hope that the vacancy rate could move in the other direction.

""I think we're very close to where the bottom of the market is"" said Taylor Riar a senior associate with the office team at Colliers in Edmonton.

""We are starting to turn the corner based on the level of activity that we're seeing"" he said.",,,,,,,,,

Charter launched Spectrum Originals in 2018 with L.A.‚Äôs Finest and has since bolstered its offerings with exclusive originals co-productions with other networks and overseas imports. Now the company is exploring options for the shows on its programming slate according to Deadline which first reported the news of its demise.

With Spectrum Originals‚Äô end upon us here are some of the standout series that found a home on the platform.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vcG9wY3VsdHVyZS5jb20vdHYtc2hvd3MvbmV3cy9tYW5odW50LWNhbmNlbGVkLXNlYXNvbi0zLXNwZWN0cnVtLW9yaWdpbmFscy1zaHV0LWRvd24v0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9wb3BjdWx0dXJlLmNvbS90di1zaG93cy9hbXAvbmV3cy9tYW5odW50LWNhbmNlbGVkLXNlYXNvbi0zLXNwZWN0cnVtLW9yaWdpbmFscy1zaHV0LWRvd24v?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Manhunt' Canceled?: Why Season 3 Might Not Happen Now,"Charter Communications is leaving the original programming business behind and shutting down Spectrum Originals. That leaves its few remaining shows in a state of limbo including the Western Joe Pickett and the upcoming Lena Headey-starring Beacon 23. It also appears there is no chance a Manhunt Season 3 could come to fruition.

Manhunt is an anthology series that debuted on the Discovery Channel in August 2017 with the first season focusing on the hunt for the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski. Although the first season won critical acclaim Discovery didn't keep it because it was getting out of the scripted business at the time. In July 2018 Deadline reported that Charter was in talks with studio producer Lionsgate for a two-season renewal. The show was created by Andrew Sodroski.

The two-season renewal didn't materialize but a second season Manhunt: Deadly Games was produced and eventually released in February 2020 on Spectrum. It aired on CBS in September 2020 and is now on Netflix. The second season starred Jack Huston as Eric Rudolph the real 1996 Summer Olympics bomber. Charter and Lionsgate never announced plans for a third season.

Back on Aug. 11 Deadline confirmed Spectrum Originals would be shuttered with Head of Original Content Katherine Pope leaving to become Sony Pictures Television Studios President. Sources told Deadline the decision to close down Spectrum Originals was not surprising and Pope's exit gave Charter the impetus to start the process. A Spectrum representative said they will look at scheduling and distributing options for programs that have already been produced in the next few weeks. Some could still be released on Sprectrum while others might revert back to the studios so they can find new homes for the projects.

There are several shows left in limbo including Joe Pickett Season 2. Beacon 23 which was renewed for a second season before Season 1 even premieres is an AMC co-production so that likely already has a home. There is also George & Tammy a series starring Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain that centers on Goerge Jones and Tammy Wynette. Sony TV also has A Spy Among Friends and Panhandle in the works for Spectrum.

Charter got into the original programming business in 2018 around the time its rival DirecTV did the same with its Audience channel. Spectrum Originals was attractive to studios because it had a short exclusivity window (that's why Manhunt: Deadly Games could air on CBS just months after its Spectrum launch). This allowed for a lower price point but increased competition and increased production costs caused by COVID safety protocols made it less attractive.

The two most high-profile Spectrum originals have long since ended. L.A.'s Finest a Bad Boys spinoff starring Gabrielle Union and Jessica Alba ran two seasons before it was canceled in 2020. Spectrum was also home to the 2019 Mad About You revival with Helen Hunt and Paul Riser.",,,,,,,,,

Occidental‚Äôs share price soared 9.9% closing up $6.41 at $71.29 after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said letting Berkshire add to its 20.2% stake was ‚Äúconsistent with the public interest.‚Äù

Berkshire had applied to increase its stake on July 11 saying it would not hurt competition undermine regulatory authority or boost costs for consumers. FERC regulates the interstate transmission of electricity natural gas and oil.

The share price of Houston-based Occidental has more than doubled this year benefiting from rising oil prices following Russia‚Äôs Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Berkshire began buying Occidental shares four days later.

Buffett‚Äôs Omaha Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock which helped finance the 2019 purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion.

Berkshire also ended June with a $23.7 billion stake in a larger oil company Chevron (CVX).

‚ÄúBuffett is taking advantage of stock market participants who are foolish about the oil and gas industry and consider it a dead business‚Äù said Cole Smead president of Smead Capital Management Inc in Phoenix which owns Occidental and Berkshire shares. ‚ÄúBuffett thinks it can make him wealthy.‚Äù

Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to Buffett‚Äôs assistant.

Occidental spokesman Eric Moses said the higher ownership limit was ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù because the company owned assets subject to FERC regulation. It said the prior limit was 25%.

FERC‚Äôs authorization does not require Berkshire to buy any Occidental shares.

Some investors and analysts have nonetheless said Berkshire could eventually buy Occidental diversifying an energy portfolio that includes several utilities electricity distributors and renewable power projects including wind.

Buffett completed one of his biggest acquisitions the $26.5 billion purchase of the BNSF railroad in 2010 after Berkshire had amassed a 22.6% stake.

Takeover?

Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he ‚Äúliked Occidental more as a wholly-owned subsidiary under the Berkshire umbrella‚Äù because it would reduce Occidental‚Äôs costs to access capital and reduce exposure to commodity markets volatility.

Independent oil analyst Paul Sankey added that Occidental can benefit from the expanded tax credit for carbon-capture projects included in the Inflation Reduction Act signed this month by President Joe Biden.

‚ÄúI can see him taking the whole thing private‚Äù Sankey said referring to Buffett.

Smead in contrast said Buffett is unlikely to buy all of Occidental soon and can instead buy more shares on the open market at lower prices than in a full takeover.

‚ÄúIn the long run he may but you don‚Äôt file something like this with FERC if you‚Äôre planning it in the next six months‚Äù Smead said.

Berkshire ended June with $105.4 billion of cash and equivalents even after buying a net $45.2 billion of stocks in the year‚Äôs first half.

Buffett has pledged to keep $30 billion on hand. Occidental‚Äôs market value was about $66 billion after Friday‚Äôs run-up.

Berkshire owns more than 90 companies outright including Geico car insurance See‚Äôs Candies Dairy Queen ice cream and several manufacturing businesses.

At Berkshire‚Äôs annual meeting on April 30 Buffett said he began buying Occidental shares after reviewing an analyst presentation.

He also expressed confidence in Chief Executive Vicki Hollub who has been reducing Occidental‚Äôs debt.

‚ÄúShe says she doesn‚Äôt know the price of oil next year. Nobody does‚Äù Buffett said. ‚ÄúBut we decided it made sense.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvamV3ZWxyeS9uZWNrbGFjZS1zdGFyLW9mLXZhbi1jbGVlZi1hcnBlbHMtaGlnaC1qZXdlbHJ5LTEyMzQ3MzkzNDUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Necklace Is the Star of Van Cleef & Arpels's Latest Collection,"Van Cleef & Arpels is no stranger to monumental stones.

Familiarity

Value

Cash

Shale

CEO

Inflation Reduction Act









Famed investor Warren Buffett is steadily snowballing a stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp. in what could end up being his biggest-ever acquisition. His Berkshire Hathaway Inc. on Friday won approval to buy as much as 50% of the shares. Some investors believe it‚Äôs a step toward a full takeover which may end up costing more than $50 billion.Here‚Äôs why Occidental is attractive to Berkshire:Inflation looks to be the mega-trend for the first half of the 2020s and crude oil is one of the best natural hedges out there. Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and a lack of investment in new oilfields over the past five years have hit supplies leading to stagnant production profiles everywhere from OPEC to US shale. Meanwhile demand for fossil fuels has been strong coming out of the pandemic even as governments push for a switch to clean energy.With investments across the energy sector from utilities to solar power Buffett claims to be a realist in the debate around fossil fuels. ‚ÄúPeople that are on the extremes of both sides are a little nuts‚Äù he said at a Berkshire shareholder meeting in 2021.Buffett first invested in Occidental in 2019 when the oil company was in a bidding war with Chevron Corp. to buy its crosstown Houston rival Anadarko. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub flew to Omaha Nebraska on the company‚Äôs Gulfstream V and convinced Buffett to add $10 billion to her war chest. It was enough to swing the deal and Chevron pulled out soon after. In exchange Buffett got preferred shares yielding 8% annually plus warrants to buy more common stock at $59.62 apiece. Today with Occidental at $71.29 those warrants would turn a profit of more than $900 million if exercised.Initially the Anadarko deal was a disaster because it loaded up Occidental‚Äôs balance sheet with more than $30 billion of additional debt right before the pandemic. Occidental‚Äôs market value went from $50 billion before the 2019 transaction to less than $9 billion toward the end of 2020 as oil prices crashed.But on the flip side this created a good value play for Buffett. When crude turned around late last year and was supercharged by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine Occidental was best-placed to benefit. The stock is the best performer in the S&P 500 this year up more than 140% compared with the index‚Äôs 11% decline.‚ÄúOxy started this year heavily indebted with massive oil exposure‚Äù said Bill Smead who manages $4.8 billion at Smead Capital Management Inc. and is a top 20 shareholder in Occidental. Soaring crude prices mean ‚Äúthey‚Äôre now paying off that debt and gushing cash. It‚Äôs the best of all worlds.‚ÄùToo much cash has been Berkshire‚Äôs biggest investing challenge over the past few years. The conglomerate had about $105 billion on hand at the end of June. It is expected to generate about $8 billion in free cash flow each quarter for the next five years according to Greggory Warren of Morningstar Research Services LLC. Inflation at the highest in 40 years is a great incentive to put that money to work.Occidental would work better as a subsidiary of Berkshire than a stock holding ‚Äúgiven the volatility that exists in the energy/commodity markets‚Äù Warren said. ‚ÄúThis could end up though evolving into a slow-motion takeover where Berkshire buys up to the stakes that FERC allows it to acquire until it can acquire Oxy whole.‚ÄùOccidental is not only one of the biggest producers in the Permian Basin the largest US oilfield but it also has one of the lowest costs with an oil price of just $40 a barrel needed to sustain its dividend. West Texas Intermediate currently trades at about $90 a barrel. Hollub has reined in the ‚Äúdrill-baby-drill‚Äù mentality that characterized shale for the first decade of its lifespan and is now prioritizing profits over production. Free cash flow hit a record $4.2 billion in the second quarter.The Anadarko purchase may have been expensive but it allowed Occidental to lift its land holdings in the Permian to 2.8 million acres 14 times the size of New York City‚Äôs five boroughs combined. It also added steady cash-flowing assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Algeria.Buffett has a good personal relationship with Hollub which began at the 2019 meeting in Omaha brokered by Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan. This year the veteran investor praised Hollub after reading a transcript of Occidental‚Äôs Feb. 25 earnings conference call in which she pledged financial discipline even as oil prices were rising.‚ÄúI read every word and said this is exactly what I would be doing‚Äù Buffett told CNBC‚Äôs Becky Quick in ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù in March. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs running the company the right way.‚ÄùThe oil industry mostly criticized the Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law this month. The $437 billion legislation ‚Äúdiscourages needed investment in oil and gas‚Äù and offers ‚Äúthe wrong policies at the wrong time‚Äù the American Petroleum Institute said.But Hollub was surprisingly upbeat calling the bill ‚Äúvery positive.‚Äù That may have something to do with its expansion of tax credits for carbon capture of which Occidental is a leading proponent. The company has plans to build the world‚Äôs biggest direct air capture plant which will command a tax credit of as much as $180 for each ton of carbon sucked out of the air.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vdGhlLWJpZy1mb3VyLW9pbHNhbmRzLWNvbXBhbmllcy1pbmZsdWVuY2UtdGhyZWF0ZW5zLWFsYmVydGEtZGVtb2NyYWN5LWFyZ3Vlcy1wb2xpdGljYWwtc2NpZW50aXN0LTE4ODU2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Big Four oilsands companies' influence threatens Alberta democracy argues political scientist,"Over the past five years ownership of oilsands production has become hyperconcentrated in four companies: Cenovus Energy Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) Imperial Oil Limited and Suncor Energy.

These four producers ‚Äî known as the Big Four ‚Äî account for about 84 per cent of Alberta‚Äôs daily production of 3.3 million barrels of bitumen a type of crude oil found in oilsands deposits.

Not only that but it is the oilsands that have driven Alberta‚Äôs economy and finances for the past two decades. According to Alberta‚Äôs 2022 budget oilsands production will make up 87 per cent of the province‚Äôs total oil production as conventional fields empty.

In the face of growing environmental concerns and regulatory requirements some international companies have decided to exit the oilsands. Between 2016 and 2019 foreign oil companies Chevron Shell BP and Statoil sold their oilsands holdings.

But other major Canadian producers like CNRL and Cenovus Energy have doubled down. They see the emission-intensive extraction operation as a golden opportunity to dominate an increasingly single-industry province.

As a political scientist who has worked in a large Alberta-based financial institution and the provincial treasury department I am familiar with the booms and busts of Alberta‚Äôs economy and its correlation to provincial finances. The financial dependence of the Alberta government on bitumen royalties has increased enormously over the past several years.

An industry flush with cash

By comparing the amount of bitumen royalties and corporate income taxes from the Big Four to Alberta‚Äôs total revenue it is possible to estimate the province‚Äôs fiscal dependency on these companies.

The numbers show that no province other than perhaps New Brunswick with its dominant Irving family comes near Alberta‚Äôs level of corporate fiscal dependency.

The revenue expected from the Big Four oilsands producers in 2022 assuming an average per barrel price of $115 will be a staggering $116 billion ‚Äî about 25 per cent of Alberta‚Äôs GDP.

During the first half of 2022 Imperial Oil Cenovus Energy CNRL and Suncor Energy have reported net income of $17.1 billion.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward

What is less understood is what this vast increase in revenue means for the Alberta treasury and to a lesser extent the federal government.

During the first six months of 2022 the Big Four paid an estimated $8 billion in royalties to the Alberta government. Most of their $6.8 billion in income tax expenses went to the federal government with the remaining 30 per cent going to the Alberta government.

Since Alberta has the lowest corporate tax rate in the country this creates an enormous incentive for these companies to create as much taxable income as possible. The taxes and royalties so far this year amount to about $10 billion which would easily pay for Alberta‚Äôs K-12 education system.

Lining the government‚Äôs pockets

The concentration of economic and financial power in the Big Four means Alberta‚Äôs next premier must heed the needs of these massive oilsands players. As oil prices rise the financial dependency of the provincial treasury on the Big Four will grow.

Alberta‚Äôs 2022 budget adopted a very conservative oil price estimate of US$70 per barrel which deliberately understated the expected surplus. It estimated bitumen royalties would return $10.3 billion during the fiscal year.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh

For every dollar above this US$70 per barrel estimate an additional $500 million in oil royalties will flow to the government. At US$100 a barrel an additional $9 billion in bitumen royalties would be paid but with oil prices averaging US$116 since April 1 an additional $23 billion in oil and gas royalties could roll in.

Using this conservative oil price forecast Alberta‚Äôs budget estimated its total revenue will be $52 billion. In reality its revenue will likely be much higher.

The Big Four contribute about 20 per cent of Alberta‚Äôs total revenue. At US$100 per barrel the Big Four contribute about 30 per cent of the province‚Äôs revenue and at US$116 per barrel the contribution exceeds 30 per cent. This gives these companies an enormous amount of control over Alberta‚Äôs finances and by extension politics.

Pathways Alliance

The Big Four‚Äôs political influence has most recently manifested in its dominant position in the Pathways Alliance. This lobbying consortium ‚Äî known as COSIA ‚Äî consists of the Big Four ConocoPhillips and MEG Energy.

According to their website COSIA‚Äôs purpose is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from oilsands production and achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions. The Pathways Alliance sees oilsands production carrying on for nearly three decades and beyond.

Central to this lobby effort has been successfully convincing Ottawa to give the firms a tax credit in the 2022 federal budget. This sets a dangerous precedent ‚Äî if Ottawa itself is willing to grant the wishes of the Big Four what chance will the Alberta premier have in refusing similar requests?

The fiscally dependent Alberta government will continue its battles against Ottawa on behalf of the Big Four. Whether or not this is good for Alberta‚Äôs democracy its residents and the planet is another matter entirely.",,,

It smells like lemonade,"CNN ‚Äî

Lemonade thieves Chipotle is on to you.

The burrito chain has released a candle in honor of National Lemonade Day which fell on Saturday this year according to a news release. The candle pokes fun at customers‚Äô habit of sneaking some free juice by ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù filling a free water cup with lemonade instead.

The cheeky limited-edition soy candle is designed to look exactly like a Chipotle water cup and is lemonade-scented the release explained.

And a bonus for lemonade lovers: Each candle comes with a promo code you can redeem for free lemonade at your local Chipotle.

Chipotle superfans can purchase a candle for $28 on the company‚Äôs merchandise website while supplies last.

The brand has acknowledged the lemonade trick before tweeting ‚Äúin this house we love and appreciate people who don‚Äôt put lemonade in their water cups‚Äù in 2018.

For Chipotle it seems the real goal of playing into the water cup meme isn‚Äôt to cut down on lemonade theft so much as to connect with fans.

‚ÄúSocial is the premier destination for us to listen to and engage with our superfans‚Äù said Chris Brandt Chipotle‚Äôs chief marketing officer in the release. ‚ÄúWhen they see these lighthearted tributes to social chatter and fan behavior they feel even more connected to Chipotle.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- Reverend William A. Lawson a civil rights icon who was also known as Houston's pastor and the founder of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church died Tuesday morning at the age of 95.

The church posted a message to their founding pastor online. ""He has completed his time of service here on earth and is now enjoying eternal rest.""

Rev. Lawson was a father of four including ABC13's Melanie Lawson but generations of Houstonians knew him as a preacher and as a trailblazer for equality.

Over the course of seven decades Rev. Lawson helped shape Houston into what it is today coming here from Kansas City in 1955 to work at Texas Southern University.

""I would love to say that I marched heroically into the civil rights movement but that wasn't the way it was at all"" Rev. Lawson said.

From TSU he helped found Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Third Ward. It started with 13 members in 1962.

A humble man with a soft voice he was not the kind to shout or wave a fist calling for change. It was his wife Audrey who encouraged him.

""'Honey you cannot have a church with just preaching and singing. You're going to have to reach out into the neighborhood and somehow be involved with the problems of people in the neighborhoods.' So I thought of this new church as being a church that was going to be both religion and social movement"" Rev. Lawson said.

He and Audrey were married for 61 years when she died in 2015.

PHOTOS: Remembering Audrey Lawson

They had four children together -- a son Eric and three daughters: Cheryl Roxanne and Melanie.

The children grew up in a house that saw visits from other civil rights icons including Martin Luther King Junior who tried to recruit Lawson to come to Atlanta.

He declined choosing to collaborate with King and others from here in his adopted hometown where he was building his church.

""I chose to stay here because of the people who had started out as 13 and who by the time were probably several hundred"" Rev. Lawson previously told ABC13.

Rev. Lawson retired from the pulpit in 2004 but he remained an influential leader and counsel for leaders and young people.

His church now has more than 12000 members today.

It's a testament to the lasting legacy of Bill Lawson the soft-spoken giant of a man who led Houston through tumultuous change with grace and humility.

""If the young people I can leave behind are people who likewise will have something to believe in and something that is going to drive them to do what is best for the underclass that is what I'd like to pass on"" Rev. Lawson said.

Lawson Legacy: How Reverend Bill Lawson became Houston's Pastor

""I wanted to be a cartoonist"" Instead Reverend Bill Lawson became Houston's Pastor. ""Lawson's Legacy"" has candid never-heard-before stories of his life's journey including peacefully integrating Houston tireless community outreach and how a letter written on a dare led to the love of his life.

EAST HARLEM Manhattan (WABC) -- A faithful flock has been coming to the tiny church on 106th Street since 1944.

But recently the reverend's been praying for more than the redemption of souls.

Pastor Jose Rivera of Holy Ghost Christian Church needs to resurrect more than $16000 someone methodically and repeatedly stole from his congregation's collection basket with check fraud.

The humble but mighty donations help keep the tiny East Harlem church's doors open and are used strictly to pay the bills.

That is until a check for $2887 dropped in the mail outside the post office to their insurance company wound up in the hands of a scammer.

""I think they stole it from the mail"" said David Diaz the church treasurer. ""That day I put it in the mailbox because it was Sunday.""

""We told them don't cash that check and don't cash any other checks that come to personal people"" Diaz said.

""Did they stop this one"" 7 On Your Side's Nina Pineda asked.

""No they didn't"" Diaz said.

The church treasurer was incensed to learn the check was washed and rewritten to a woman. Even after it was flagged for fraud three other checks were cashed.

One for Spectrum for $674 was changed to $5000.

A check to Con Ed was changed to a different name and cashed for $6598.

In all the church was out $15985.76.

Despite providing the bank with proof of the original checks as requested in the investigation the fraud claim was denied.

""The rejection letter's claiming they cannot prove there was fraud saying we did not provide original years"" Diaz said.

""Which you have in your hand"" Pineda said.

""And they've had for 7 months"" Rivera said.

As soon as 7 On Your Side contacted Ponce the bank reimbursed Holy Ghost every cent of the stolen checks.

""The other bank should have realized the person opening the account committed fraud"" said Carlos Naudon President and Ceo Ponce Bank.

Naudon said check tampering is the largest source of fraud and small regional banks like Ponce founded in the south Bronx with just 13 branches around the city struggle with it daily.

""So you think these big banks should be held accountable?"" Pineda asked.

""Yes"" he said.

""What should customers do to prevent this from happening?"" Pineda said.

""They should put a hold on the account"" Naudon said.

After 7 months of being haunted by this nightmare Holy Ghost was whole.

""The very next day solved your problem instantly"" Diaz said.

""I thank you Channel 7"" Rivera said. ""We thank the Lord first and having you be here praise the Lord.""

The bank CEO says you should:

- Monitor accounts carefully

- If you notice something suspicious put a hold on checks

- Change your account

- Go ""checkless"" and pay your bills electronically

- Use a gel pen

Some 1200 people attended the unexpectedly emotional gathering.

Heidelberg's famous Church of the Holy Spirit a 600-year-old edifice in the town's historic city center was the scene of an unusual religious service on Sunday where some 1200 congregants came together to pray and contemplate (and enjoy) a performance of US pop star Taylor Swift's songs as part of a special liturgy.

Staged under the name ""Anti-Hero ‚Äî Taylor Swift Church Service"" organizers at the Protestant church said the event was conceived to attract younger people as well as to focus on the profound religious convictions expressed in many of Swift's songs.

Swift ‚Äî who was not at the service but rather on her latest European tour ‚Äî was raised in the American ""Bible Belt"" and has never hidden her Christian beliefs often integrating these into her music.

This was what inspired church organizers. ""The Church of the Holy Spirit has always been a place of encounter and exchange. That's why a pop-music religious service fits so perfectly"" said Heidelberg Pastor Christof Ellsiepen. ""With it we are giving space to the questions and issues that occupy the younger generation.""

A contemplation of the gospel according to Tay-Tay

Though the idea might suggest a wild concert atmosphere it was largely one of quiet devotion.

Parish Pastor Vincenzo Petracca quoted numerous lyrics and traced Swift's biography emphasizing her attachment to and understanding of Christianity in everyday life.

Petracca acknowledged that Swift's songs are open to numerous interpretations but highlighted the strong Christian ‚Äî and political ‚Äî messages she integrates into her songs which address the subjects of women's rights racism and gender equality among others.

The pastor noted however that such topics have made Swift the object of criticism in conservative Christian circles especially among Evangelicals in the US who have branded her ""anti-Christian.""

Swift herself has chastised ""hypocritical faith"" that puts dogma before people. The pastor emphasized as well that ""her faith knows doubt and inner-conflict.""

""Theologically speaking she points to the justness of God"" says Petracca adding ""For her faith and action are inseparable.""

A congregation moved to tears and dancing in their pews

Throughout both Sunday services ‚Äî two were staged in order to accommodate the large number of people who attended ‚Äî the congregation which was notably younger and and more female than is often the case were treated to live performances of six Swift songs.

These were performed by Tine Weichmann ‚Äî a singer from Hamburg and now a professor of popular church music in Heidelberg ‚Äî and her band. Behind them a rainbow-colored sign reading ""Everybody is welcome!""

One of the most emotionally stirring moments of the service came when Weichmann and her band performed ""Soon You'll Get Better."" Swift wrote the song for her mother who had been diagnosed with cancer.

The lyrics she penned speak to desperation and the healing powers of medicine ‚Äî and of prayer: ""Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you / Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too.""

Pastor Petracca who admitted the Church of the Holy Spirit was ""built for Gregorian liturgical music and not for Taylor Swift"" said of the service ""I stared into beaming faces ‚Äî and during the song that Taylor wrote for her cancer-stricken mother many had tears in their eyes.""

But no Swift-themed service would be complete without an uplifting communal outburst of joy which is exactly what happened when the band struck up the concluding hymn ""Shake It Off!"" This brought the entire congregation to their feet singing and dancing before breaking into furious applause.

""Anti-Hero"" was just the latest in a series of ""City Church Rock 'n' Pop"" services started in 2015.

This June the Church of the Holy Spirit has invited guests from across Europe to take part in a street dance service that will be held at the same time as its ""Church Battle"" dance competition.

Tetapi apakah Anda pernah berpikir untuk beralih ke sains untuk membantu memperbaiki patah hati Anda?

Untuk membantu Anda dengan patah hati Anda berikut ini enam nasihat favorit yang didukung oleh psikolog yang mungkin dapat membantu Anda move on bahkan setelah putus cinta yang paling menyakitkan. Jika Anda mengikuti langkah-langkah ini Anda mungkin akan sembuh lebih cepat dari yang Anda kira.

1. Biarkan diri Anda merasa kesal

Jika Anda mencoba melupakan perpisahan dan berpura-pura tidak pernah terjadi Anda hanya menunda proses penyembuhan. Dalam Ted Talk How to Get Over The End of a Relationship Dr. Antonio Pascual-Leone seorang psikolog klinis dan peneliti mengatakan untuk fokus pada perasaan sedih kekosongan dan kesepian yang tidak nyaman daripada menghindarinya.

""Saat Anda menghindari masalah tidak ada yang bisa berubah"" jelasnya. Sementara lamanya proses koping berbeda-beda untuk setiap orang penelitian Dr. Pascual-Leone menunjukkan bahwa banyak langkah yang diperlukan sama dan yang pertama adalah selalu membiarkan diri Anda merasakan semua emosi.

Anda harus melalui tangisan itu untuk memahami apa yang Anda rasakan dan mengapa Anda merasa seperti itu. Juga Anda tidak akan menekan atau menahan emosi apa pun dalam jangka panjang ketika Anda membiarkan diri Anda benar-benar merasakannya.

Cisco brings Forever New England a slightly hazy IPA to Gillette stadium and bars and restaurants across New England. Courtesy

Nantucket-born brewery Cisco has partnered with the New England Patriots to launch a new beer ahead of the 2022 football season. ‚ÄúForever New England Gameday IPA‚Äù is the first professional sports partnership for the brewery.

The new brew is a slightly hazy India pale ale made with Amarillo and Galaxy hops. It clocks in at 5.4% alcohol by volume.

The beer‚Äôs packaging spotlights the retro ‚ÄúPat the Patriot‚Äù logo on a royal blue can which the Patriots will feature on their throwback uniforms at select home games this year.

Forever New England will be on shelves at liquor stores throughout New England in both 16-ounce can 4-packs and 12-ounce can 12-packs. It‚Äôll also be on offer at restaurants and bars across the region from Connecticut to Maine.

‚ÄúAt Cisco we‚Äôve always been a brewery that has brought people together for a good time‚Äù said Matt O‚ÄôNeill Cisco Brewers general manager in a statement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pumped to continue that tradition by uniting New Englanders over the two things we all love: the Patriots and good craft beer.‚Äù

Cisco has also partnered with New Hampshire‚Äôs Green Mountain Taps to create a custom tap handle for the beer.

On tap at Gillette and throughout Patriots‚Äô Place for the 2022 season Forever New England will also be featured at Cisco‚Äôs five pub locations: Nantucket; the Seaport; New Bedford; Portsmouth New Hampshire; and Stamford Connecticut. Cisco‚Äôs Portsmouth location will brew the ale.

Cisco‚Äôs Seaport location which opened in 2018 stays open this year through Oct. 17. The outdoor beer garden features Cisco classics like Gray Lady Wheat Ale Whale‚Äôs Tale Pale Ale and Gripah Grapefruit IPA. They also offer cocktails by Triple Eight Distillery and food by Rexicana‚Äîtacos tots chips and salsa and even a lobster roll.

This new beer comes from a longstanding partnership between the Patriots and Anheuser-Busch.

Fact: To date there has been just one overt suggestion that Barry and Iris were actively (ahem) ‚Äútrying‚Äù and yet no Clearblue or First Response kit has been spied.

Fact: The thing that Flash fans want most from the 13-episode final season is the official start of WestAllen‚Äôs family ‚Äî and ideally not just some ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pregnant!‚Äù declaration leading into the series finale‚Äôs closing credits. ‚ÄúIris being pregnant better not be the note the series ends on‚Äù TVLine reader Scott for one opined. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the season has to take place over nine months nor should the writing surrounding Iris‚Äôs pregnancy mimic that of Felicity‚Äôs‚Ä¶ but there has to be something substantial.‚Äù

Or as TVLine reader Nora similarly put it ‚ÄúI need to see Barry and Iris start their family DURING the season and not only in the last five minutes of the last episode.

Lotte Chemical has reportedly submitted a tender to acquire a controlling stake in South Korean copper foil manufacturer Iljin Materials on Friday.



The Seoul-based petrochemical firm is considered one of the proposed buyers of the 53.3 percent stake in Iljin Materials from President and Chief Executive Officer Huh Jae-myung which will cost around 3 trillion won ($2.24 billion). Citigroup Global Markets Korea Securities is the deal manager.



Copper foil is one of the key components of secondary batteries for electric vehicles. About 40 kilograms of copper foil is needed for the production of a single electric vehicle causing increased demand for the material that surrounds cathodes used in batteries.



Iljin Materials has supplied copper foil products to Korean battery cell makers LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI.



Iljin Materials logged an operating profit of 46.8 billion won in the first half of this year up 33.5 percent from the previous year. The company disclosed in May that its largest shareholder has been reviewing plans for a selloff.



The petrochemical unit of South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group looks to become the second-largest copper foil producer in Korea through the acquisition after SK nexilis. Iljin Materials manufactures about 15 percent of the world‚Äòs copper foil. The company currently has an annual copper foil production capacity of 40000 tons.



Lotte Group has been expanding its investment in electric vehicle battery components. Lotte Chemical announced in May plans to invest a combined 4 trillion won in the field of battery components by 2030 with the goal of generating 5 trillion won in revenue annually beginning 2030.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9yaWRnZXdvb2Qvc2VjdGlvbnMvZWR1Y2F0aW9uL2FydGljbGVzL21lZXQtdGhlLWxlYWRlcnMtcmlkZ2V3b29kLWJvYXJkLW9mLWVkdWNhdGlvbi1tZW1iZXItbXVoYW1tYWQtbWFobW91ZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the Leaders: Ridgewood Board of Education Member Muhammad Mahmoud,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.tapinto.net/towns/ridgewood/sections/education/articles/meet-the-leaders-ridgewood-board-of-education-member-muhammad-mahmoud on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9yaWRnZXdvb2Qvc2VjdGlvbnMvZWR1Y2F0aW9uL2FydGljbGVzL21lZXQtdGhlLWxlYWRlcnMtcmlkZ2V3b29kLWJvYXJkLW9mLWVkdWNhdGlvbi1tZW1iZXItbXVoYW1tYWQtbWFobW91ZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2xhZGF3bi13YWxrZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzYyODIxMTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LaDawn Walker Obituary - Allen Family Funeral Options - Plano - 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/ladawn-walker-obituary?id=36282110 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2xhZGF3bi13YWxrZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzYyODIxMTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

But they haven't been very good at inviting the right people into their ballparks.

A few weeks back the team was criticized for allowing Pete Rose to return to the ballpark during alumni weekend.

It was bad.

He made an offensive comment to Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Alex Coffey tried to correct it by saying more off color things and then while visiting the booth for an inning said more offensive things.

In the first half of today's doubleheader against the Mets the Phillies had another PR blunder.

First pitch problems

The team allowed the leader of the 7Line a Mets' fan group to throw out the first pitch at today's game.

There's very little good to say about the Mets.

Mr. Met is OK I don't dislike Mrs. Met that's about it.

But it's very easy to dislike this fan group that has a Twitter page that absolutely shreds the Phillies its fans and the city.

It is far from the biggest problem today.

Phillies fall to Mets again

The Phillies once again fell to the Mets losing 8-2. The team is 0-9 against the Mets in games pitched by Aaron Nola and Zack Wheeler the team can't seem to hit anymore and every chance they get the players are making Keith Hernandez look like a genius. That's the ups and downs of a baseball season and it's hard to argue this team hasn't played well. They're sitting in the second Wild Card spot on Aug. 20.

But the team has to do a better job of handling things outside of baseball.

Fans of other teams shouldn't be throwing out the first pitch. And it should never happen at the ballpark of your biggest rival.

Staying hot:How hot are the Phillies? They look like they can make some noise in NL playoffs

Luckily the bad taste in Phillies fans' mouths will only fester for another hour or so before the team plays the second half of the doubleheader.

On Sunday at Citizens Bank Park in his major league debut he issued a denial to Philadelphia Phillies hitters.

Fisher sparkled in pitching three scoreless innings Mark Canha hit two homers and drove in five runs and the New York Mets rallied past Philadelphia 10-9.

""It's pretty surreal right now"" Fisher said. ""I'm so thankful and so blessed for the opportunity. It hasn't even sunk in yet.""

Fisher allowed one hit while striking out one and walking two.

""This is my dream"" he said.

The 26-year-old lefty went undrafted out of the University of Nebraska before pitching in 12 games at Class A for the Seattle Mariners organization in 2019.

With the uncertainty of COVID-19 halting his baseball career Fisher followed a former coach into banking in 2020 in his hometown of Omaha. Fisher worked there until June 2021 when he re-signed with the Mariners making it all the way to Triple-A.

This season with the Mets organization Fisher was 0-1 with a 3.77 ERA in 12 games at Double-A Binghamton and 1-2 with a 3.12 ERA in 12 games at Triple-A Syracuse before his call-up prior to Sunday's game.

""It's pretty cool"" Mets manager Buck Showalter said.

When Fisher entered in the fifth he caught more than a few people by surprise.

""I didn't even know who this guy was when he came into the game today"" Canha said.

Fisher retired three batters and walked one. He then walked Kyle Schwarber to lead off the sixth before being forced to sit out a 46-minute rain delay. Fisher returned and got three straight outs and he finished by facing the minimum in a scoreless seventh.

For Fisher it was just another day at the office.

Tougher work environment?

""Probably the Phillies lineup -- but those days can get long at the bank too"" he said laughing.

In the first half of Saturday's double-header a Mets fan threw out the first pitch:

The fan is the ""The General"" of ""The 7 Line"" an ""independently owned"" Mets lifestyle brand:

I would be sick to my stomach if I was a Phillies fan in the crowd this afternoon. The team hasn't made the postseason in 11 years and are struggling to beat their rival up I-95 constantly. Yes they're in the playoff mix but it has to be rough to see a given fan's most hated team show them up both before the game and during it.

I cannot fathom the reason for this. Perhaps it was some sort of charity situation? I could wrap my head around that if there was some good cause that went with this even though I'm sure Phillies fans would still not be happy. Mets fans have completely taken over CBP. Are the Phillies throwing them a bone for the huge spike in ticket sales?

As a Philadelphian I am embarrassed for the sake of the city.



UPDATE [4:38 p.m.]

It looks like this happened because the dude bought 1500 tickets to the game. He bought a whole section for Mets fans?

Anyone in the organization consider saying no to that? So weird. I texted my 52-year-old South Philly lifer father about this. I can‚Äôt reprint what he said and I‚Äôd imagine a large portion of this fan base shares his sentiment.

The Mets trailed by four runs after one inning and one run heading into the ninth and Canha boosted the Mets up each time.

The left-field seats at Citizens Bank Park had Canha's name written all over them as he tied the game with a three-run home run in the seventh inning and then sent the Mets on their way to a topsy-turvy 10-9 win with a two-run shot off David Robertson in the top of the ninth in front of a divided crowd of 35801 fans.

Brandon Nimmo added one more critical long ball with two outs to spoil Tyler Cyr's debut and Edwin Diaz closed the door with his 28th save despite giving up his first earned run since June 18.

As Canha's second home run sailed into the seats Canha punctuated the Mets' series win by hoisting his bat several feet into the air along the first-base line.

""It‚Äôs nice to finally get in a groove where I‚Äôve been getting a little bit hot and hitting some homers"" said Mark Canha who ran his season totals to 10 home runs and 47 RBI. ""The lack of power has been kind of frustrating but I realize it‚Äôs a journey. It‚Äôs kind of been a long haul for me to get to this point where I am in this season. I was just super happy to contribute and get one for the boys.""

The victory was the Mets' third over the Phillies in as many days and helped them to grab a four-game lead over the Braves who lost to the Astros in their series finale. It was an emotional win on the eve of a two-game series against the Yankees.

""It's a good club a really good team. Another one"" Buck Showalter said. ""We just played one we played one in Atlanta and we're going to play another one tomorrow. We'll grind it for nine innings and we'll see where the baseball gods take us.""

Canha finished 3-for-5 with two home runs five RBI and two runs in his biggest performance for the Mets in his first season with the team.

Nate Fisher makes long-awaited debut

From the bank to the big leagues Nate Fisher never gave up on his dream of pitching in the major leagues.

The 26-year-old left-hander went undrafted out of University of Nebraska-Lincoln before latching on in the lower ranks of the Mariners' farm system. He was released and took a finance job in 2021 before heading back to the minor leagues with the Mariners and joining the Mets' system in late May.

""Always believed in myself never got down on myself. I kept believing"" Fisher said. ""My family and support system is so amazing and so critical for that. I‚Äôm thankful for the people around me to keep me going when there was some uncertainty. I‚Äôm truly blessed for the opportunity.""

METS:Offense goes abruptly cold in second half of doubleheader to Phillies

On Saturday Fisher was called upon for a long relief appearance after another debutant right-hander Jose Butto struggled in four innings. The Nebraska native twirled three scoreless innings intersected by a 46-minute rain delay for another critical support performance for the Mets.

Fisher came on with the Mets trailing 7-4 in the bottom of the fifth inning and exited in a tie game after Canha's first home run off Connor Brogdon in the top of the seventh inning. The left-hander worked one more inning picking off Bryson Stott on a steal attempt and freezing Nick Moton on a high slider.

""It‚Äôs kind of indescribable. It‚Äôs pretty surreal right now"" Fisher said. ""I‚Äôm so thankful so blessed for the opportunity. It hasn‚Äôt even soaked in yet.""

Tough start for Jose Butto

Brett Baty's first start in Mets uniform will forever be stashed in fans' memories.

It was complete with a smooth swing that netted him a home run in his first major-league at-bat followed by the epic reaction from his family and friends in the ballpark at Truist Park.

Not every debut has the same story-book feel.

Butto learned that the hard way. The 24-year-old right-hander worked through a five-hit opening inning and gave up a pair of three-run home runs to Alec Bohm and an RBI single to Maton.

Butto was staggered throwing 38 pitches in his very first inning of his major-league career and one batter away from being removed. Each of the Phillies' first five batters reached base with Schwarber lining a single and Rhys Hoskins drawing a walk before Bohm's first blast. After three more hits Butto was able to get Matt Vierling to pop up and Bradley Zimmer to wave through a curveball.

The next two innings were a strong response with Butto settling in straying from the changeup and allowing only two hits.

""After that first inning I was able to settle in and I was able to execute my pitches a little better"" Butto said. ""I was able to get on the same page with the catcher and I felt like I had good results after that first inning.""

After the Mets tied the game at 4-4 a long fourth inning spelled disaster for Butto. Zimmer reached on an infield single and Schwarber walked before Bohm lashed his second home run of the day off the right-field foul pole. Butto closed his day with back-to-back strikeouts.

Rapid riser

Butto the Mets No. 15 prospect spent the majority of this season with Class AA Binghamton where he made 18 of his 20 starts. While he was there he notched a 6-5 record with a 4.00 ERA and 1.31 WHIP.

Butto only made two appearances with Class AAA Syracuse allowing three earned runs across five innings in his first start and being pulled after one inning three days before his debut.

It was similar to Baty's rapid rise. The 22-year-old third baseman only played six games in Syracuse before being called up.

But Butto did not have the same instant success and he will likely need to spend some time back with Syracuse before making another appearance with the Mets.

Eduardo Escobar Taijuan Walker progressing

Buck Showalter said he expects Eduardo Escobar who is dealing with a low-grade oblique strain to spend the minimum amount of time on the injured list.

The soonest that Escobar can return would be Aug. 16. Escobar's injury paired with Luis Guillorme missing time with a left groin strain paved the way for Baty's debut.

""He‚Äôs almost pain-free"" Showalter said. ""I think he‚Äôs going to make that on time for us.""

Meanwhile Taijuan Walker who is dealing with a went through fielding drills before Sunday's game which he was originally scheduled to pitch. Showalter said the team would wait to see how Walker felt following that workout before making a decision on when he will start next.

""You need to simulate what caused the injury"" Showalter said. ""You need to go through that which he did.""

Showalter added that Tomas Nido who has missed the last week on the COVID IL may need to make a catch a game elsewhere before returning for the Mets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tL2F0aGxldGljLzM1MjQ5MTEvMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9waGlsbGllcy1tZXRzLWRvdWJsZWhlYWRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For Phillies to seize a playoff spot it will take contributions big and small,"PHILADELPHIA ‚Äî The gates to Citizens Bank Park hadn‚Äôt been opened long Saturday when Bailey Falter stepped onto the grass at 6:43 p.m. because the cleaning crews needed time between doubleheader games. The ballpark was still empty; the sky wasn‚Äôt falling. Close. Falter was summoned from Triple A as a spot starter in an important game. Less than 10 minutes into his on-field preparation Milwaukee blew another game to a bad Cubs team.

It‚Äôs all relative when seven teams are angling for six postseason slots in the National League. The Phillies just have to be better than one of them in the next six weeks.

The Phillies have problems. They are not as good as the Mets one of the best teams in baseball and that is not a grand revelation gleaned from this weekend. New York‚Äôs best is better ‚Äî the Phillies lost all nine games against them started by Aaron Nola and Zack Wheeler.

‚ÄúWhen the time comes to face them next‚Äù Wheeler said after an 8-2 loss Saturday ‚Äúthen we‚Äôll get to that point and figure it out.‚Äù

If there is a next time for Wheeler against the Mets what a story that will be. The Phillies and Mets have never met in the postseason. The Mets have dominated them this season. Their fans invaded South Philadelphia this weekend. One of them even threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Saturday‚Äôs first game. (The Phanatic refused to catch it.) The Mets are formidable.

Wheeler still has good friends over there; he spent some time in right field Friday afternoon with Jacob deGrom. But Wheeler has never pitched in the postseason. He was an injured spectator when his teammates soared into the 2015 World Series. He has an idea of what it looks like when a team has it and when it doesn‚Äôt.

If the Phillies aren‚Äôt in the Mets‚Äô class so be it. Does it mean the Phillies are not a good team as constructed?

‚ÄúWe know what kind of team we are‚Äù Wheeler said. ‚ÄúWe need to win some ballgames against you know some of these better teams like that. But at the end of the day we‚Äôve been playing well. It has been against lesser teams but those are the games that you‚Äôre supposed to win. And we have been winning those. You know you need to win those games to get to where we want to be. We all know that. We know what type of team we are. We‚Äôre going to just keep pushing.‚Äù

There is a good debate to have about what constitutes a successful Phillies season in 2022. Is it merely ending the playoff drought that is the second longest in the sport? Should the highest payroll in club history have higher expectations? No one in the clubhouse or front office wants to entertain this conversation yet because in the moment success is measured day to day.

Was Saturday a success? The Phillies split a doubleheader against a good team. It wasn‚Äôt pretty. Wheeler did not have exceptional command. The Phillies squandered opportunities in both games.

Before a pitch was thrown Seranthony Dom√≠nguez felt some tightness in his right triceps while he played catch with a teammate. He told an athletic trainer about it. Around 11:30 a.m. Rob Thomson learned he would not have his closer for at least the two games Saturday. Dom√≠nguez has made everything easier for the Phillies interim manager because when the back of the bullpen is settled the rest of the relievers fall into place. Dom√≠nguez has never pitched a full major-league season and this has lingered in the back of team officials‚Äô minds. It is why they were aggressive in pursuing David Robertson who recorded a two-inning 36-pitch save in Saturday night‚Äôs 4-1 Phillies win.

If the Phillies had to press pause on Dom√≠nguez‚Äôs season for two weeks it is not the end of the world. If it‚Äôs worse than that there are issues.

‚ÄúI feel really worried about it because it‚Äôs my arm‚Äù Dom√≠nguez said. ‚ÄúI take it seriously because I‚Äôve got to take care of my arm because it‚Äôs the only way I can compete.‚Äù

What is the level of concern?

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know until we check him out (Sunday) and we find out more‚Äù Thomson said.

So he managed Saturday‚Äôs second game with four available pitchers. (Thomson has said he will not use a pitcher in both games of a doubleheader.) The Phillies handed Falter the ball and crossed their fingers. He loaded the bases in the first inning with a hit batter and two walks and fired a wild pitch that put the Phillies behind. He escaped only when Nick Castellanos made a sliding catch in right field.

The Phillies scoured the league for an upgrade over Falter at the trade deadline and settled on Noah Syndergaard but they knew Falter would be needed here and there. ‚ÄúGive us six innings‚Äù Thomson said between games. ‚ÄúSix solid innings.‚Äù Falter did just that ‚Äî even after the shaky beginning.

He was sent back to the minors afterward. He had done his job.

‚ÄúIt was exactly what we needed‚Äù Thomson said. ‚ÄúAnything less we might have been in trouble.‚Äù

‚ÄúFantastic‚Äù Castellanos said. ‚ÄúHe came up and did everything that the team could have asked from him. He did his job and then some.‚Äù

As the Phillies nudge toward relevant October baseball it is uncharted territory for so many on the roster. It‚Äôs not just Wheeler. Jean Segura has played the most active games among all big leaguers without a postseason appearance. J.T. Realmuto has never been there. None of the homegrown Phillies has.

It will take contributions big and small. Caleb Cotham the 34-year-old pitching coach found Falter in a small room at the bottom of the dugout steps after the first inning.

‚ÄúI was a little heated‚Äù Falter said. ‚ÄúCaleb came in and calmed me down a little bit. ‚ÄòLock it in. Time to go to work here.‚Äô That‚Äôs what we did.‚Äù

The Phillies know the situation. They want to imagine a scenario in which they can match the Mets. Maybe it happens in October. But to get there the smaller tests are just as important.

It is right in front of them; there are no extra points for style.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at the point now where every single game that we win it matters‚Äù Castellanos said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting down to crunchtime. It‚Äôs no secret the Mets are a really good baseball team. So we do what we can. Hopefully we come across with a win (Sunday). Then we win the game we‚Äôre supposed to win for the rest of the season and we‚Äôre in good shape.‚Äù

It was loved for its calm interiors and smooth engine but above all the Maruti badge.

BHPian Shreyfiesta recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

Introduction:

The Maruti Esteem used to be one of the most familiar faces on Indian roads its lineage went back to the Maruti 1000 which was launched in 1990. In 1994 Maruti plonked the fabulous 1298cc all-aluminium engine into the 1000's body added a few cosmetic changes and the Esteem was born. Available with manual and automatic transmission options the Esteem quickly became the preferred set of wheels for senior management in the corporate world. Everyone loved the Esteem at one point of time and still do for its calm interiors and smooth engine but above all they loved the Maruti badge - a badge that over the years has come to stand for quality reliability and aspiration. The Esteem was battling the likes of the Hyundai Accent Ford Ikon and Opel Corsa in the early-2000s.

The sheer brand equity of the Maruti Suzuki brand name propelled the sales of the car and suddenly there were Esteems all over the place! At one point only the rich could afford an Esteem but today if you've got just enough money to put down on an iPhone 13 Pro this sedan can be yours for as little as ‚Çπ 100000 for a mint-condition MPFI car. With a hefty 84bhp wrapped in a lightweight shell the Esteem MPFI was a rocket no less. The car was a tuner's favourite also in the late-nineties and if someone was looking at a good base car to start building a street-machine or just a commuter saloon with plenty of excitement an Esteem was the way to go during those days for sure.

It's been 14 years and a half since the last unit of Esteem rolled out of the production line. Production of the Esteem came to an end by December 2007 and the relevance of the model was almost completely outlawed due to the advent of Swift and Dzire. Yet the 'Esteem' remains as one of the most respected nameplates in India's automotive history. Time passes like a flash and I believe it's now time to look back at the story of the brand in India that too in a very detailed manner. So let's embark upon the journey of Esteem in a series of posts. This thread contains some of the brochures unseen advertisements and photos of the Esteem/1000 from the bygone era.

Also I would like to thank the following websites and groups for sharing those unseen treasure of images magazine articles and advertisements:

Chapter 1: Maruti 1000

Back in the early-90s the Maruti 1000 used to be the status symbol for many families in India. It was actually the first time the nation's largest car maker tried to sell a luxury car in our market. Did it really work? Was it better than the HM Contessa or the Premier 118 NE? Was that just a brand building tool for Maruti Udyog? Or was that a hoax from the company? Hang on. As the dust settles over the launches of more mid-size SUVs in our country we need to move back in time and ask some simple questions - Where have these good ol' sedans gone now? Have they been scrapped? Or have they been sold in small towns at a cheaper price?

Export-spec Maruti 1000's brochure from early-ninties shared by @addict_car on Twitter:

Indian Auto November 1989 issue's cover page featuring a Maruti 1000. Picture was shared on CME group by BHPian anjan_c2007:

Coming back to the topic. There was nothing wrong with the HM Ambassador too back then better known as the Amby these days. Yes there were about a million-odd car owners who chose nothing but a Maruti 1000 as their Ambys passed into old age. Nothing was against the cars like Premier Padmini and Ambassador except for the times. Maruti Udyog used to sell two small cars also at that time the 800 and the Omni and the smallest the 800 made strong economic sense for a country like India. Maruti 800 already had 90 percent local content by late-eighties and the sticker price was among the lowest one could ask for in a four-wheeler anywhere in the world.

Maruti 1000 being compared with HM Contessa and Premier 118NE by Indian Auto in June 1991:

When Maruti hurried the launch of its 1000cc sedan nobody realised that they were anticipating future events. Maruti 1000 was one of the first contemporary sedan-type cars launched in India. Back in the day it was the most expensive model in MUL's product range. The sedan was launched in November 1990 in three variants : Standard AC and GLX priced at ‚Çπ 3.2lakh ‚Çπ 3.4lakh and ‚Çπ 3.5lakh ex-showroom respectively. The company had adopted a computerised lottery system to figure out who will own a Maruti 1000. Thereby it matched the taste of elite class for whom it was like a status symbol.

In fact there were rumours that the IT department was sending queries to all people who had booked a Maruti 1000. Most of the external changes in the 1000 adapted from the the three-box Suzuki Swift was perceived as cosmetic at first sight but the truth was that there was a purpose behind every changed curve. Spacious grey interiors of 1000 had moquette seats which added to the looks of cabin. Equipments like fabric upholstery floor carpets lockable fuel lid trunk room lamp and air-con were incorporated in this car. Superior White St.Germain Red Blue and Silver were the exterior body colour options offered initially. At the heart of Maruti 1000 lied a 1.0-litre carburetted petrol engine that churned out 46bhp at 5500rpm and 71Nm at 3500rpm mated with a 5-Speed manual gearbox. This engine was such a weakling for this car due to its weight measuring in 825 kg.

Maruti 1000's picture infront of Rashtrapati Bhavan from www.indiacontent.in:

996cc engine was a bit underpowered particularly with the AC switched on:

One major drawback that drivers encountered while manoeuvring the Maruti 1000 was the drop in its pick-up with air conditioning switched on. On the other side this sedan was good on fuel consumption. The car was actually perfect for those people who needed a cheap-to-run easy-to-maintain petrol saloon. While the power was just adequate to provide a decent driving experience it was a completely different story with the air-conditioner switched on when the engine felt positively underpowered. The addition of aftermarket free-flow exhaust kits noticeably improved power and driveability.

Ambience inside 1000's cabin was similar to that of an imported car back in the day. Here's a picture from the interior of BHPian mole's 1000:

Rear view of the Maruti 1000 showing its high boot line. Picture from Indian Auto's November 1989 issue. Courtesy : anjan_c2007:

The 1000 had an independent suspension setup at all four corners. The car used MacPherson strut units at the front and coil spring damper units in the back. 1000‚Äôs front suspension with its lower A-arm setup worked very well. The rear suspension which employed a lower arm and strut also performed well. Body construction in the 1000 was all-steel monocoque. The metal under the wiper spindle was prone to corrode due to collection of leaves and debris. Absorption of water and retention of moisture led to corrosion of the area in most cars. The engine suffered from having to ignite the fuel-air mixture by means of a contact-breaker point system. This required constant attention to correct the breaker gap for achieving an optimum spark.

Sun 21 Aug 2022

For the first time since 29th August 2019 the Manx Grand Prix returned to the TT Mountain Course and with good conditions all around the 37.73-mile circuit it was an ideal first qualifying session for competitors at this year‚Äôs event.



It was Brian McCormack who set the fastest lap of the afternoon with a lap of 120.164mph in the Classic Superbike class on his Greenall Racing Kawasaki with James Hind (Lightweight) John McGuinness MBE (Senior Classic) Stephen Smith (Senior) and Chris Moore (Junior) topping the other leaderboards.



After a 30-minute delay to the Newcomer‚Äôs speed controlled lap commenced at 2.00pm and 20 minutes later the opening Senior and Classic Superbike session got underway and the Team Classic Suzuki pairing of Michael Dunlop and Phil Crowe led the field away.



They were quickly followed by fellow Classic Superbike competitors McCormack Michael Rutter (Bathams Ales Suzuki) the returning David Johnson (Alasdair Cowan Racing Kawasaki) Jamie Coward (KTS Racing powered by Steadplan Kawasaki) Paul Jordan (Mistral Racing Kawasaki) and Johnson‚Äôs teammate Craig Neve with Dean Osborne (TC Racing Honda) and Jamie Williams (NCE Racing Honda) two of the first riders away on the Senior class.



Dunlop was an early retirement at Greeba Castle with Coward stopping at Quarterbridge and Michael Sweeney (Mistral Racing Kawasaki) pulling up at Ginger Hall but Rob Hodson (Greenall Racing Kawasaki) had no such problems and he was quickest on the opening lap with a speed of 120.060mph.



Hodson was followed by Neve (118.453mph) Dominic Herbertson (118.207mph) Jordan (117.861mph) Nathan Harrison (117.024mph) McCormack (116.987mph) Rutter (115.857mph) and Johnson (115.778mph) whilst it was fancied runner Smith (Alasdair Cowan Racing Kawasaki) who topped the Senior class on the first lap with a speed of 114.868mph.



David McConnachy (113.946mph) Jamie Williams (113.138mph) back at the Manx for the first time since 2018 and Tom Robinson (112.198mph) were next up on their Supersport machines but newcomer and local rider Frankie Stennett was a retirement at Ballaugh Bridge.



A number of riders pitted after their first lap to understandably make adjustments but Hodson went straight through whilst further retirements were posted by Lee Johnston Ryan Kneen Sam West Julian Trummer Mike Browne and Jamie Cringle with 2019 Classic Superbike winner Johnson stopping to make adjustments at Douglas Road Corner before proceeding.



Hodson was quickest all around the second lap but stopped between Crony ny Mona and the Grandstand with a broken exhaust bracket and it was Neve who was first man back with a lap of 119.911mph. Jordan (119.359mph) McCormack (118.598mph) Phil Crowe (117.839mph) Paul Williams (117.683mph) and Michal Dokoupil (117.308mph) all upped their pace and McCormack put in a third lap of 120.164mph to move to the top of the leaderboard.



Jordan (119.635mph) and Johnson (119.606mph) moved into third and fourth overall and Senior pace setter Smith also upped his pace the Liverpudlian posting an impressive lap of 118.871mph whilst Williams and McConnachy were now up into the 115mph bracket ahead of Marc Colvin.



At 3.30pm it was the turn of the Junior Lightweight and Senior Classic session the latter being led away by the Davies Motorsport Yamaha pairing of Dominic Herbertson and Lee Johnston the similarly-mounted James Hillier (CSC Racing) and 23-time TT winner McGuinness (Winfield Paton).



Ian Lougher and Mike Browne (both Laylaw Racing Yamaha) Michael Dunlop (Crossan Motorcycles Honda) and Hind (Dennis Trollope Yamaha) were some of the first Lightweight machines to leave the line with Andrew Fisher (VRS Kawasaki) Francesco Curinga (ILR Paton) and Victor Lopez Santos (Xecretia Road Racing Aprilia) early Junior starters.



The red flag was out just three minutes later though due to an incident on the approach to Union Mills the rider reported as being conscious and talking. It was 4.17pm when the session was restarted Dunlop and Rodger Wibberley the first away on this occasion the latter on his Junior machine.



Dunlop (112.611mph) was the first back along Glencrutchery Road followed a bit later by Wibberley (102.326mph) but the latter was quickly knocked off the top spot by Mark Herbertson (104.681mph). However they were firmly upstaged by Victor Lopez Santos who lapped at 109.686mph on his Xecretia Road Racing Aprilia.

One of the most prevalent long-term symptoms is excessive fatigue or exhaustion.""Post-viral fatigue is very different from 'normal' tiredness. People with post-viral fatigue feel generally unwell and some may experience unexplained muscle pain sleep disturbance exhaustion even after slight exertion mental-fogginess and dizziness on standing"" Dr Javadekar added.Exercises to build stamina and yoga can help in such situations doctors said.""Group activities can also keep one motivated.

Familiarity

Value

Cash

Shale

CEO

Inflation Reduction Act









Famed investor Warren Buffett is steadily snowballing a stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp. in what could end up being his biggest-ever acquisition. His Berkshire Hathaway Inc. on Friday won approval to buy as much as 50% of the shares. Some investors believe it‚Äôs a step toward a full takeover which may end up costing more than $50 billion.Here‚Äôs why Occidental is attractive to Berkshire:Inflation looks to be the mega-trend for the first half of the 2020s and crude oil is one of the best natural hedges out there. Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and a lack of investment in new oilfields over the past five years have hit supplies leading to stagnant production profiles everywhere from OPEC to US shale. Meanwhile demand for fossil fuels has been strong coming out of the pandemic even as governments push for a switch to clean energy.With investments across the energy sector from utilities to solar power Buffett claims to be a realist in the debate around fossil fuels. ‚ÄúPeople that are on the extremes of both sides are a little nuts‚Äù he said at a Berkshire shareholder meeting in 2021.Buffett first invested in Occidental in 2019 when the oil company was in a bidding war with Chevron Corp. to buy its crosstown Houston rival Anadarko. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub flew to Omaha Nebraska on the company‚Äôs Gulfstream V and convinced Buffett to add $10 billion to her war chest. It was enough to swing the deal and Chevron pulled out soon after. In exchange Buffett got preferred shares yielding 8% annually plus warrants to buy more common stock at $59.62 apiece. Today with Occidental at $71.29 those warrants would turn a profit of more than $900 million if exercised.Initially the Anadarko deal was a disaster because it loaded up Occidental‚Äôs balance sheet with more than $30 billion of additional debt right before the pandemic. Occidental‚Äôs market value went from $50 billion before the 2019 transaction to less than $9 billion toward the end of 2020 as oil prices crashed.But on the flip side this created a good value play for Buffett. When crude turned around late last year and was supercharged by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine Occidental was best-placed to benefit. The stock is the best performer in the S&P 500 this year up more than 140% compared with the index‚Äôs 11% decline.‚ÄúOxy started this year heavily indebted with massive oil exposure‚Äù said Bill Smead who manages $4.8 billion at Smead Capital Management Inc. and is a top 20 shareholder in Occidental. Soaring crude prices mean ‚Äúthey‚Äôre now paying off that debt and gushing cash. It‚Äôs the best of all worlds.‚ÄùToo much cash has been Berkshire‚Äôs biggest investing challenge over the past few years. The conglomerate had about $105 billion on hand at the end of June. It is expected to generate about $8 billion in free cash flow each quarter for the next five years according to Greggory Warren of Morningstar Research Services LLC. Inflation at the highest in 40 years is a great incentive to put that money to work.Occidental would work better as a subsidiary of Berkshire than a stock holding ‚Äúgiven the volatility that exists in the energy/commodity markets‚Äù Warren said. ‚ÄúThis could end up though evolving into a slow-motion takeover where Berkshire buys up to the stakes that FERC allows it to acquire until it can acquire Oxy whole.‚ÄùOccidental is not only one of the biggest producers in the Permian Basin the largest US oilfield but it also has one of the lowest costs with an oil price of just $40 a barrel needed to sustain its dividend. West Texas Intermediate currently trades at about $90 a barrel. Hollub has reined in the ‚Äúdrill-baby-drill‚Äù mentality that characterized shale for the first decade of its lifespan and is now prioritizing profits over production. Free cash flow hit a record $4.2 billion in the second quarter.The Anadarko purchase may have been expensive but it allowed Occidental to lift its land holdings in the Permian to 2.8 million acres 14 times the size of New York City‚Äôs five boroughs combined. It also added steady cash-flowing assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Algeria.Buffett has a good personal relationship with Hollub which began at the 2019 meeting in Omaha brokered by Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan. This year the veteran investor praised Hollub after reading a transcript of Occidental‚Äôs Feb. 25 earnings conference call in which she pledged financial discipline even as oil prices were rising.‚ÄúI read every word and said this is exactly what I would be doing‚Äù Buffett told CNBC‚Äôs Becky Quick in ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù in March. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs running the company the right way.‚ÄùThe oil industry mostly criticized the Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law this month. The $437 billion legislation ‚Äúdiscourages needed investment in oil and gas‚Äù and offers ‚Äúthe wrong policies at the wrong time‚Äù the American Petroleum Institute said.But Hollub was surprisingly upbeat calling the bill ‚Äúvery positive.‚Äù That may have something to do with its expansion of tax credits for carbon capture of which Occidental is a leading proponent. The company has plans to build the world‚Äôs biggest direct air capture plant which will command a tax credit of as much as $180 for each ton of carbon sucked out of the air."

As of March 31st 2022 Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway owned 400 million shares of Coca-Cola (KO) for a market value of about $24 billion. This makes Coca-Cola one of the larger holdings in Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs massive portfolio as well as making Berkshire one of the largest shareholders of Coca-Cola. The stock makes up just under 8% of Berkshire‚Äôs total stock portfolio.

In this article we‚Äôll take a close look at Coca-Cola‚Äôs business it‚Äôs growth opportunities and its total return prospects.

Business Overview

Coca-Cola is one of the world‚Äôs largest beverage companies and is the single largest non-alcoholic beverage maker. It owns a vast portfolio of hundreds of different products including its ubiquitous sparkling beverage brands like Coke and Diet Coke as well as teas coffees nutritional drinks juices milks waters and more.

The company distributes its products through a network of distribution points that spans almost every country in the world and the company sells more than two billion individual servings everyday globally.

Coca-Cola was founded in 1886 generates about $42 billion in annual revenue and its market cap stands today at $258 billion. Coca-Cola is a mega-cap stock.

In addition Coca-Cola is a Dividend King having boosted its annual dividend for 60 consecutive years.

Growth Prospects

Coca-Cola‚Äôs growth stagnated from 2017 to 2020 when earnings-per-share oscillated around $2.00 but no real progress was made. That was during the time when the company was divesting most of its bottling operations which caused revenue to fall.

However this was planned as the remainder of the company ‚Äì the actual beverage making components ‚Äì have much higher profit margins than the commoditized bottling business.

Now that the transformation is complete Coca-Cola is back to growth and we think its recent portfolio additions position it well for the future.

The company has recently moved heavily into teas and coffees including its purchase of Costa. Coca-Cola has been ramping its exposure to these non-sparkling categories and the company believes not only in the growth potential of this category but in its massive total market size globally as seen above. We believe the company‚Äôs portfolio is a massive advantage over competitors positioning it for robust earnings growth for many years to come.

Coca-Cola‚Äôs legacy brands ‚Äì such as its Coke Diet Coke Sprite and other sparkling beverages ‚Äì have stagnated or even contracted in recent years. However the company has developed and acquired its way to diversifying away from relying upon those brands for growth and we believe it is better for it.

Recent sizable acquisitions include Costa a coffee chain based in the UK Fairlife a dairy producer that makes filtered milks and BodyArmor a maker of enhanced water drinks. In all cases Coca-Cola is going after markets where it doesn‚Äôt already have sizable market share and its diversified strategy to growing is something we think will pay off in the future for shareholders.

We note recent cross-branding efforts as well which takes advantage of the company‚Äôs enormous portfolio to create unique products. One such example is Coca-Cola Coffee which combines its namesake sparkling beverage with Costa coffee.

Competitive Advantages & Recession Performance

Coca-Cola‚Äôs competitive advantage is in its portfolio of hundreds of brands as well as its unrivaled distribution network around the world. The company‚Äôs ability to test new products or variants of existing products in specific markets and then distribute the winners quickly around the globe is something no company can match.

It also possesses very strong brand loyalty among hundreds of millions of consumers around the world.

This all helps Coca-Cola‚Äôs recession resistance which is also quite good. The company held up very well during the Great Recession:

2007 earnings-per-share of $1.29

2008 earnings-per-share of $1.51 (17% increase)

2009 earnings-per-share of $1.47 (3% decline)

2010 earnings-per-share of $1.75 (19% increase)

Not only did Coca-Cola survive the Great Recession it thrived. Coca-Cola grew earnings-per-share by 36% from 2007-2010. This shows the durability and strength of Coca-Cola‚Äôs business model.

While beverages such as what Coca-Cola sells aren‚Äôt necessities consumers treat them as an affordable luxury even in tough times so the company‚Äôs revenue and earnings are well protected against recessions. We believe that Coca-Cola‚Äôs earnings will hold up nicely during future downturns.

Valuation & Expected Returns

Coca-Cola‚Äôs price-to-earnings ratio in the past decade has mostly been in the low-20s which is where we find fair value. We expect the valuation to remain around 23 times earnings long-term which takes into account the company‚Äôs growth prospects its higher profit margins following bottling divestitures and its earnings stability.

Today shares trade for about 25 times earnings so the stock is slightly overvalued. That could pose a ~1% annual headwind to total returns in the coming years.

The dividend yield is 2.9% today which is fractionally below the company‚Äôs recent average of just over 3%. This also suggests that perhaps Coca-Cola is slightly overvalued at present.

However when we combined the valuation headwind the ample dividend yield and the expected growth rate of 6% we believe shareholders can achieve total returns in excess of 7% annually in the next five years. That‚Äôs good enough for a hold rating for Coca-Cola and we‚Äôd be buyers on a meaningful pullback in the share price.

Final Thoughts

We see Coca-Cola as an attractive dividend stock for long-term investors given its earnings predictability its revamped business model that is focused on margins and its unparalleled suite of non-alcoholic brands.

While the stock is slightly overvalued the yield is still double that of the S&P 500 and we see meaningful growth ahead. We rate Coca-Cola a hold and note that on a pullback it would be an exceptional dividend stock purchase.

In a statement Coca-Cola Philippines thanked President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. who is concurrently the head of the Department of Agriculture and chairman of the Sugar Regulatory Board ""for his immediate action in addressing the current shortage of premium refined sugar in the Philippines.""

However the company said that ""not all sugar is the same.""

‚ÄúFood and beverage manufacturers need premium refined sugar to maintain high-quality products. This type of sugar is not the same sugar that is commonly used in households‚Äù Coca-Cola Philippines said.

‚ÄúWe have shared with the President that the industry needs at least 450000 metric tons of premium refined bottler grade sugar to utilize 100% of its manufacturing capacity for the balance of the year and serve the orders of customers who are depending on our products for their sales and income‚Äù it said.

The Philippine Association of Stores and Carinderia Owners (PASCO) earlier said that the insufficient deliveries of soft drinks had negatively affected their sales.

Coca-Cola Philippines along with Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines Inc. and ARC Refreshments Corp. earlier said that the bottling industry is facing a shortage of premium refined sugar‚Äîa key ingredient in making their products.

According to Coca-Cola Philippines there is currently a 400000 metric ton shortage on top of the initially projected 200000 metric ton shortfall in local sugar supply for this year.

It said this is based on a projected demand of 2.3 million metric tons for 2022 for the entire country it said.

‚ÄúAlong with many other companies in the Philippine food and beverage industry beset by the difficulties brought on by the sugar shortage we at Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines Inc. (CCBPI) are in the midst of implementing various efforts aimed at cushioning the business impact of the lack of premium refined sugar supply‚Äù the company said.

‚ÄúAs always we are keeping our consumers customers and our people front and center. We and the broader industry look forward to continuing to work with the President and all relevant government offices to address the situation and deliver a sustainable solution as we get back to delivering our full line-up of beverages and supporting the country‚Äôs economic recovery‚Äù it added. ‚ÄîVBL GMA News",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvLnR6L2NvY2EtY29sYS1kb25hdGVzLXRhYmxlcy1ib290aHMtdG8tdHJhZGVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola donates tables booths to traders,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='dailynews.co.tz', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /coca-cola-donates-tables-booths-to-traders/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000114D7C6FB50>, 'Connection to dailynews.co.tz timed out.

Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa played in just two series in his preseason debut.

It was the first look at Tagovailoa in the Dolphins' new system after the team brought in former 49ers offensive coordinator Mike McDaniel as the new head coach. Playing with most of his starters Tagovailoa completed 6 of 8 passes for 58 yards.

Stidham completed 7 of 10 passes for 80 yards and was sacked once.

Wilfredo Lee/AP Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel talks to quarterback Skylar Thompson during the second half of a preseason game against the Las Vegas Raiders Saturday Aug. 20 2022 in Miami Gardens Fla.

The Raiders' touchdown came from a 12-play 75-yard drive which included passes of 14 15 and 18 yards capped by a 2-yard touchdown run by running back Zamir White who could be the Raiders' No. 1 option to back up starter Josh Jacobs. Jacobs did not play.

Tagovailoa did not lead a touchdown drive but he connected with tight end Durham Smythe for a 10-yard gain on his first throw of the game and found running back Chase Edmonds for a 17-yard gain on the next play. The Dolphins' offense looked unsettled on the drive however and was forced to punt.

Edmonds acquired in the offseason showed how important he could be in the Dolphins offense this season. He caught two passes on two targets for 21 yards and had just 3 rushing yards on three carries but in his most impressive play he caught a short pass from Tagovailoa and shed a Raiders defender to convert on third down.

Tagovailoa looked comfortable and had the time he needed to make his throws but Miami got little production in the run game with its starters on the field. The Dolphins' most productive runner was backup Salvon Ahmed who finished with 20 yards and five carries.

Veteran quarterback Teddy Bridgewater replaced Tagovailoa. On his first drive he was penalized for intentional grounding in the end zone resulting in a safety.

Bridgewater also made some impressive throws including a 26-yard completion to rookie receiver Erik Ezukanma.

Tyler Van Dyke QB Miami

Lynne Sladky/AP Miami quarterback Tyler Van Dyke throws during the first half against Virginia Tech Saturday Nov. 20 2021 in Miami Gardens Fla.

The Atlantic Coast Conference rookie of the year in 2021 was thrust into action prematurely and didn't disappoint. Tyler Van Dyke was particularly impressive down the stretch throwing for three or more touchdowns in his final six games with only three interceptions during that same span. He finished the year throwing for 2931 yards with 25 touchdowns and just six interceptions.

Anthony Richardson QB Florida

Phelan M. Ebenhack/AP Florida quarterback Anthony Richardson scrambles for yardage during the first half of a game against Georgia Saturday Oct. 30 2021 in Jacksonville Fla.

Now that Emory Jones has transferred to Arizona State Anthony Richardson is the clear No. 1 entering the first season of the Billy Napier era at Florida. The Gators are counting on him to turn their fortunes after last season's 6-7 record. Richardson who was born and raised in Gainesville started four games a season ago and saw limited action as a true freshman in 2020 but he's only thrown for 556 yards and seven touchdowns ‚Äì plus six picks ‚Äì in two seasons. The expectation is that he'll flourish under Napier's tutelage and help make his entire team better.

Jordan Travis QB Florida State

John Raoux/AP Florida State quarterback Jordan Travis looks for a receiver against Florida during the second half Saturday Nov. 27 2021 in Gainesville Fla.

The fate of Florida State's season is dependent upon the health of Benjamin School alumnus Jordan Travis. Although he's been somewhat typecast as a run-first quarterback Travis has made great strides as a passer. His accuracy improved from 55.0% in 2020 to 62.9% last fall. For the first time in his Florida State career Travis is the definitive starter to begin a season. If he can stay healthy and stay on the field Travis should give the Seminoles a chance to win more often than they have lately.

N'Kosi Perry QB Florida Atlantic

Doug Murray/AP FAU quarterback N'Kosi Perry throws the football against Georgia Southern during a game Saturday Sept 11 2021 in Boca Raton Fla.

N'Kosi Perry started all 12 games for Florida Atlantic last season after transferring from Miami throwing for 2766 yards and 20 touchdowns with seven interceptions. He was also the team's fourth-leading rusher with 160 yards on the ground and four more scores. Perry was a key contributor to FAU's 5-3 start last season but the Owls fell apart in their final four games missing a bowl game for the first time since 2018. Perry will benefit from the return of the team's leading receiver in LaJohntay Wester who had 65 catches for 702 yards and four touchdowns. Perry will need to continue to show improvement if FAU wants to get back to a bowl in its final season of Conference USA competition.

Mikey Keene QB Central Florida

John Raoux/AP Central Florida quarterback Mikey Keene looks for a receiver against Connecticut during the first half Saturday Nov. 20 2021 in Orlando Fla.

Central Florida is poised to challenge for the American Athletic Conference title in Gus Malzahn's second year. A big reason for that is the return of quarterback Mikey Keene who took over for an injured Dillon Gabriel last season and started the final 10 games as a freshman completing 63.6% of his passes for 1730 yards and 17 touchdowns against six interceptions ‚Äì none in his last five games. In fact Keene enters the season with 145 consecutive pass attempts without an interception.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2ludGVsbGlnZW50LWF1dG9tYXRpb24vdG9wLWludGVsbGlnZW50LWF1dG9tYXRpb24tY29tcGFuaWVzLXRvLWxvb2tvdXQtZm9yLWluLTIwMjPSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmFseXRpY3NpbnNpZ2h0Lm5ldC9hbXAvc3RvcnkvaW50ZWxsaWdlbnQtYXV0b21hdGlvbi90b3AtaW50ZWxsaWdlbnQtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1jb21wYW5pZXMtdG8tbG9va291dC1mb3ItaW4tMjAyMw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Intelligent Automation Companies to Lookout for in 2023,UiPath Studio is the workflow designer and the company's powerful and user-friendly automation canvas.

‚ÄúDental decay is an important public health issue globally and the US CDC reports that tooth decay is the most common childhood disease five times more common than asthma in children five to 17 years of age.‚Äù

Dr. Tappoo says a recent research shows a connection between oral disease and other health issues like low birth weight pre-term delivery and iron deficiency.

To mark its sixth year anniversary Sai Prema Foundation opened a dental clinic at its Sanjeevani Medical Centre in Nasese Suva on Friday.

Sanjeevani Medical Centre director Dr Krupali Tappoo said the dental clinic can be accessed by children from all different backgrounds for free.

Dr Tappoo said its aim was to provide quality oral health education examination extraction conservative treatment and tooth brushing drills for small children.

She said it was important to have a clinic as such because studies have shown that children with congenital heart defects suffer poor oral health compared with healthy heart children.

‚ÄúIn the span of six years we are happy to now offer dental services for children at our medical centre‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúAs the Sai Prema Foundation and Sanjeevani Children‚Äôs Hospital has a focus on congenital heart defects this makes the new dental centre even more important.

‚ÄúChildren with congenital heart disease are at risk of bacterial endocarditis an infection of the tissue that lines the heart and blood vessels.

‚ÄúStudies have shown that children with coronary heart disease suffer poor oral health compared with heart health children.

‚ÄúThis is most likely related to a combination of abnormal dental formation associated with the cardiac conditions and dental neglect.

‚ÄúTherefore all children will who are selected for surgery for congenital heart defects will undergo an immediate dental check-up‚Äù she said.

Fiji National University acting vice chancellor Dr William May said while the foundation would be responsible for the running of the dental centre Fiji National University will provide staffing at the centre.

‚ÄúIn January last year the Sai Prema Foundation and the university signed a memorandum of understanding to foster cooperation understanding strategic alliance and partnership to serve the people and make a difference in multiple ways‚Äù Dr May said.

‚ÄúThrough this partnership our College of Medicine Nursing and Health Sciences‚Äô dental faculty and trainee dental students are to provide high-quality dental treatment and oral health services to the children of Fiji completely free of cost.

Wireless contributes three-quarters of all revenues and broadband and cable services account for about a quarter of sales. The company‚Äôs network covers ~300 million people and 98% of the U.S.

On July 22 2022 the company reported the fiscal year‚Äôs second-quarter and first six months results. Revenue was flat year over year (YoY) at $33.8 billion for the quarter compared to the second quarter in 2021. Earnings came in at $1.24 per share a decrease of 11.4% compared to the $1.40 per share the company made in 2Q201.

Source: Investor Presentation

The company had a net addition of 268000 including 256000 fixed wireless net additions. Total broadband net additions increased by 39000 from first-quarter 2022 and fixed wireless net additions increased by 62000 from first-quarter 2022.

The cash flow from operations was down for the year‚Äôs first half from $20.4 billion to $17.7 billion. While capital expenditures were up $2.4 billion to $10.5 billion in the first half. Thus Free cash flow for the quarter was down from $11.7 billion to $7.2 billion for the first half of the year.

We expect annual returns of 16.4% over the next five years consisting of 4% EPS growth the 5.7% dividend yield and a 6.7% return from an expanding P/E multiple.

12 years of consecutive increases Dividend Yield: 3.2%

3.2% Expected Total Return: 16.6%

State Street Corporation is a Boston based financial services company which traces its roots back to 1792. State Street is one of the largest asset management firms in the world with approximately $4 trillion of assets under management and $44 trillion of assets under custody and administration.

In September of 2021 State Street announced the acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services for $3.5 billion which would make State Street the number one asset servicing firm globally. Asset servicing provides back-end operations for many of the world‚Äôs most popular funds and ETF‚Äôs. State Street‚Äôs main competitors include BlackRock Bank of New York Mellon and Vanguard.

In mid-July State Street reported (7/15/22) financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Fee revenues dipped -6% over last year‚Äôs quarter due to headwinds from weaker stock markets and bond markets.

However net interest income grew 25% thanks to higher interest rates and the bank generated high forex trading earnings and kept its total expenses essentially flat. As a result its earnings-per-share grew 11% sequentially from $1.57 to $1.74 and exceeded the analysts‚Äô consensus by $0.20.

We expect annual returns of 16.6% per year for State Street. This will be driven by 7% expected EPS growth plus the 3.2% dividend yield and a sizable boost from an expanding P/E multiple.

Comcast has had 14 consecutive dividend increases. The fast dividend growth was possible through solid earnings growth and a safe dividend payout ratio. Its dividend is well-covered by earnings and cash flows. Comcast is one of the largest players in the entertainment industry. New market entrants would have to spend many billions of dollars to establish as a key cable player or entertainment network.

The cable industry is impacted by the nationwide cord-cutting trend though as some customers are ditching traditional pay-TV entirely. Comcast has so far been able to withstand this trend through growth from its other businesses.

In late July V.F. Corp reported (7/28/22) financial results for the fiscal 2023 first quarter. Revenue of $2.26 billion rose 3.2% year over year and beat analyst estimates by $20 million. The North Face brand led the way with 37% currency-neutral revenue growth in the quarter.

However inflation took its toll on margins and profits. Gross margin of 53.9% for the quarter declined 260 basis points while operating margin of 2.8% declined 640 basis points. As a result adjusted EPS declined 68% to $0.09 per share.

Blue-Chip Stock #2: Sonoco Products (SON)

40 years of consecutive increases Dividend Yield: 3.2%

3.2% Expected Total Return: 17.8%

Sonoco Products provides packaging industrial products and supply chain services to its customers. The markets that use the company‚Äôs products include those in the appliances electronics beverage construction and food industries. Sonoco was founded in Hartsville South Carolina in 1899 and introduced the first paper textile cone. The company generates about $7.2 billion in annual sales. Sonoco Products is now composed of 2 segments Consumer Packaging and Industrial Packaging with all other businesses listed as ‚Äúall other‚Äù.

On July 21st 2022 Sonoco Products reported second quarter earnings results for the period ending July 3rd 2022. Revenue surged 38.4% to a company record $1.91 billion which was in-line with analysts‚Äô expectations. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $1.76 compared very favorably to $0.84 in the prior year and was $0.11 above estimates.

Source: Investor Presentation

Consumer Packaging revenues grew 65.6% to a segment record $990.1 million due once again in large part to the purchase of Ball Metalpack that closed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Higher selling prices also factored into results. Global rigid paper containers had slight volume growth outside of North America where supply constraints limited business.

Flexible packaging volume grew 4% but was offset by mix. Industrial Paper Packing sales grew 20% to a segment record $727.4 million as higher selling prices more than offset a small volume decline and currency exchange headwinds.

Sonoco Products raised its outlook for 2022 as well with the company expecting adjusted earnings-per-share of $6.20 to $6.30 for the year up from $5.25 to $5.45 and $4.60 to $4.80 previously.

Rodriguez (2-3) hadn't pitched in the majors since suffering a rib-cage injury on May 18. He left the team after a June 9 rehab assignment to deal with family issues and was on the restricted list until Friday.

Detroit's pitchers held the Angels scoreless in the final 15 innings of the series. Los Angeles had two on and two out in the third but Greene made a diving catch in center to rob Luis Rengifo of at least one RBI.

Ohtani retired the first two batters in the fourth but walked Akil Baddoo and Greene before Victor Reyes made it 3-0 with a triple. Kody Clemens increased the lead to 4-0 in the fifth with an RBI double off Jimmy Herget.

Chang's beef broccoli,"Imagine you are at the grocery store. You‚Äôre elated to see a bag of your favorite Chinese restaurant dish ‚Äì beef and broccoli from P.F.

Chang‚Äôs ‚Äì in the frozen food section. You buy it and drive home. Maybe your mouth waters a little.

However once you get into your kitchen and open the bag a surprise spills out: orange chicken. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Food Safety and Inspection Service nearly 120000 pounds of Conagra Brands food was recalled last month for that very reason. Even more concerning the orange chicken product contains egg which was not declared on the bag‚Äôs label.

Severe egg allergies can lead to anaphylaxis which the Mayo Clinic describes as a ‚Äúlife-threatening emergency that requires an immediate epinephrine (adrenaline) shot and a trip to the emergency room.‚Äù

So far there have been no reports of adverse reactions due to the mislabeling incident. However anyone who is concerned about a reaction should contact their healthcare provider.

After receiving two consumer complaints the producing establishment notified the USDA FSIS about the packaging mix-up.

In a July 30 notice the USDA announced that an Arkansas-based Conagra producer recalled 119581 pounds of mislabeled food in 22-oz. packages that read ‚ÄúP.F. CHANG‚ÄôS HOME MENU BEEF & BROCCOLI‚Äù produced between May 26 and May 27 this year. The bags have a ‚Äú5006 2146 2012‚Äù lot code as well as a ‚ÄúBEST BY MAY 21 2023‚Äù expiration date label and a ‚ÄúP115‚Äù establishment number on the side panel above the nutrition facts.

‚ÄúFSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers‚Äô freezers‚Äù said the agency. ‚ÄúConsumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.‚Äù

As of Saturday the recall was still active and high priority. It does not include any product sold at P.F. Chang‚Äôs restaurants.

Consumers with questions about the recall can contact Conagra Brands at (800) 280-0301 or Consumer.Care@conagra.com. Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 888-MPHotline (888-674-6854) via email to MPHotline@usda.gov or the online 24/7 Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System.

La historia de Nikola Tesla es una mezcla de ficci√≥n y de realidad. En estos d√≠as de ajetreado movimiento de n√∫meros alrededor del precio de la electricidad Nikola ser√≠a el gran protagonista.



Si preguntamos en la calle quien era Nikola Tesla nos resultar√≠a dif√≠cil encontrar a alguien que sea consciente dela importancia de su trabajo.



Resulta dif√≠cil situar el nombre de Tesla. Algunos familiarizados con el magnetismo podr√≠an reconocer en su apellido la unidad (tesla) que mide la intensidad de un campo magn√©tico pero en realidad su nombre abre las puertas de un historia que est√° m√°s cerca de las series de las plataformas televisivas que de la realidad.

Qu√© naciera un d√≠a de tormenta le convertir√≠a en un hombre de luz sumido en su incomprendida oscuridad personal.Tesla domesticador de las leyes naturales ve√≠a enlas posibilidades de la electricidad la oportunidad para que la especie humana ascendiera a un nuevo nivel.



Bombillas clavadas directamente en el suelosin cables sin un aparente generador una luz milagrosa sin explicaci√≥n terrenal esa era su idea. Convertir esto en la m√°s poderosa herramienta de industrializaci√≥n y civilizaci√≥npara todos pensando en el bien com√∫n.



¬øQu√© dir√≠an las redes sociales de Nikola? Alabado y criticado ecologista radical visionario due√±o de un trastorno populista...



Lejos de todo esto Nikola es y ser√° uno de los pilares m√°s importante de la industrializaci√≥n y modernizaci√≥n de nuestra civilizaci√≥n. Descubrimientos y desarrollos tecnol√≥gicos que jam√°s podr√≠amos haber pensado tienen su sello.

Justicia para la persona  para el cient√≠fico para el visionario que quiso o dice la leyenda energ√≠a libre para todos.Paradoja de lo que actualmente estamos viviendo el mercadeo una vez m√°s de una necesidad.



Quiz√° en un futuro  haya alguien con sus mismas capacidades y mejor suerte que nos lleve a otro mundo m√°gico energ√©ticamente estable y accesible para todos.



Tesla naci√≥ el 10 de julio de 1856 en Similijan  Croacia. Era croata pero con descendencia serbia. Curs√≥ numerosos estudios y m√°s all√° de su conocido enfrentamiento con Edison desarroll√≥ diversas ideas que han servido para que se le reconozca como el ¬´padre de la tecnolog√≠a moderna¬ª .Varios inventos que se basaron en sus conocimientos  los seguimos utilizando hoy en d√≠a.



Era el cuarto de 5 hermanos cuyos padres fueron Militum  sacerdote de la iglesia ortodoxa y Duka su madre que era analfabeta pero con una extraordinaria memoria. Secri√≥ en un entorno bastante familiar y creci√≥ en el campo.



Su personalidad se caracterizaba por ser sinest√©sico y sufr√≠a un desorden obsesivo-compulsivo. Era muy exigente con la higiene y limpieza tanto que incluso mandaba a sus empleados a casa a cambiarse de ropa. Adoraba a los animales.



¬´Nuestras virtudes y nuestros defectos son inseparables como la fuerza y la materia. Cuando se separan el hombre no existe¬ª es una de sus frases m√°s conocida.



¬´Si la gente se mantiene despierta en vez de irse a dormir ocasiones no faltar√°n de que vean cosas a√∫n m√°s sorprendentes. Alg√∫n d√≠a no en este momento estar√© en condiciones de anunciar algo que ni siquiera hab√≠a imaginado¬ª dec√≠a.



Su curriculum comienza en 1862 en la escuela polit√©cnica de Gospic. Comenz√≥ ingenier√≠a en Graz Viena y continu√≥ su formaci√≥n en la Universidad de Praga.



En 1880 se traslada a Budapest y trabaja en una compa√±√≠a de tel√©grafos.



En 1881 le nombran jefe de electricistas de la empresa y m√°s tarde ingeniero responsable del primer sistema telef√≥nico del pa√≠s. Un a√±o despu√©s decide viajar a Par√≠s y comienza su trabajo como ingeniero en la Continental Edison Company donde concibe el Motor de Inducci√≥n.



En 1886 Nikola Tesla funda su propia compa√±√≠a y los inversores no estuvieron de acuerdo con sus planes de desarrollo del motor de Corriente alterna relev√°ndolo de su puesto. Trabaja como simple obrero con el fin de reunir capital suficiente para su pr√≥ximo proyecto.



En 1889 construy√≥ un laboratorio en Colorado Springs donde cre√≥ una torre de alta tensi√≥n para desarrollar la transmisi√≥n de la energ√≠a el√©ctrica sin cables y gratuita para todo el mundo.



Y en 1891 patent√≥ la que ser√≠a su m√°s famosa invenci√≥n la base para la transmisi√≥n inal√°mbrica de corriente el√©ctrica conocida como la bobina de Tesla. Gracias a √©l se desarroll√≥ el motor de inducci√≥n la centralhidroel√©ctrica los fluorescentes la transmisi√≥n inal√°mbrica la telegraf√≠a sin hilos y la radio.



El 7 de enero de 1943 una empleada que trabajaba en el Hotel New Yorker entr√≥ en la habitaci√≥n 3327 donde encontr√≥ el cuerpo sin vida de un hombre de 86 a√±os que hab√≠a vivido en el hotel durante la √∫ltima d√©cada. Era Tesla. Como datos curiosos sobre su vida destaca que naci√≥ en un d√≠a de tormenta seg√∫n la leyenda familiar la partera dijo a la mitad del nacimiento: este ni√±o ser√° un ni√±o de la oscuridad a lo que su madre respondi√≥ no ser√° un ni√±o de la luz. Construy√≥ una torre para enviar electricidad por el aire.

The company envisions up to 2.4 million square feet that could be built relatively quickly under existing zoning and another 2 million square feet or more that would evolve over time with the right market conditions and zoning changes. Davis has not yet disclosed plans for the property‚Äôs waterfront area.

During the past few weeks The Davis Companies has been sharing its preliminary plans for the ExxonMobil property. The Boston-based developer recently secured an agreement to buy the heavily contaminated site ‚Äî technically several connected parcels stretching from Sweetser Circle at the intersection of routes 99 and 16 down to the Mystic River waterfront.

One of Greater Boston‚Äôs biggest developments in years is taking shape just north of the Boston city line on a sprawling 95-acre fuel tank farm in Everett.

City councilors welcomed the potential to clean up the property but raised concerns about traffic and school crowding during a meeting earlier this month with two representatives for Davis.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like we‚Äôre adding an adjacent city to the City of Everett‚Äù city councilor Stephanie Martins said in an interview. ‚ÄúWe need to really balance the existing and the new in a way that is sustainable.‚Äù

Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria is among those who hope the Davis redevelopment can be the impetus to finally extend the Silver Line rapid bus service into Everett and maybe even prompt a train station to be built there. Tracks for the MBTA‚Äôs Newburyport/Rockport line traverse Everett near the ExxonMobil property but there are no stops in the city.

‚ÄúOne of the most critical components of this project is the chance for us to attract new commercial businesses and job opportunities for our residents‚Äù DeMaria said of the Davis project. ‚ÄúI also think that the size and scale of this type of development will help force the state to move forward with using federal dollars available to it for the public transit improvements that I have been advocating for over the past several years.‚Äù

The potential redevelopment of the ExxonMobil tank farm comes at a pivotal point in the metamorphosis of the section of Everett around Lower Broadway transforming it from what was widely seen as home to a gritty industrial dumping ground on Boston‚Äôs doorstep to an entertainment destination with desirable housing and high-paying tech jobs. Wynn Resorts helped kick things off by opening its gleaming $2.6 billion casino and hotel in 2019 where a Monsanto chemical plant once stood overlooking the Mystic. Wynn also bought land across Broadway (Route 99) for redevelopment and is pursuing plans for a concert-and-conference venue for one of those properties to be connected to Wynn‚Äôs Encore Boston Harbor casino by an overhead footbridge.

Meanwhile Constellation Energy put a 40-plus-acre portion of its Mystic power plant property across from the casino on the market and hopes to wrap up that sale by the end of the year. Among the potential uses for that property that are being discussed: a stadium for the New England Revolution pro soccer team owned by the Kraft Group. Constellation plans to eventually shutter the two remaining gas-fired units at the power plant in two years.

The biggest of all of these is the ExxonMobil property which has been home to some form of petroleum storage and distribution since the 1920s.

Mike Cantalupa chief development officer for Davis told the city council that the developer will seek tax incentives or other public subsidies from city and state officials to help offset environmental remediation and infrastructure costs.

‚ÄúThe first and foremost issue on the site is to clean it up and it comes at a tremendous cost‚Äù Cantalupa said. ‚ÄúWe like to think we bring creative solutions to complex problems. ... We can‚Äôt be the sole provider but we need to solve them cooperatively and with the city‚Äôs input.‚Äù

Davis officials want to start with a 1 million-square-foot first phase with three buildings ‚Äî 300 to 350 apartments in one warehouse storage in a second and advanced manufacturing in the third. (Davis is currently developing a warehouse next door rumored to be for Amazon.)

The project features two distinct sections: a residential area and an industrial area through the center of the property around Beacham Street to feature warehouses as well as high-tech and life sciences manufacturing. Perkins&Will

At full buildout Davis sees the potential for more than 4 million square feet of development taking place including apartment towers and public green space ‚Äî as well as labs and biomanufacturing in part aimed at life sciences companies headquartered a short drive away in Cambridge.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt think this is your grandfather‚Äôs industrial park ‚Äî buildings with solid block walls and you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on inside the buildings‚Äù Cantalupa said. ‚ÄúThe buildings and the architecture need to be attractive.‚Äù

Reassuring city councilors‚Äô concerns about schools and traffic could pose another challenge.

Martins for example ticked off a list of potential issues with the development on her campaign Facebook page on Wednesday.

She said a solid commitment from state officials for a new train station is imperative as is a traffic mitigation plan to address the congestion along Route 99 and the Sullivan Square rotary in nearby Charlestown. She also wants to see a new fire and police substation built in the Lower Broadway area to accommodate all the new development.

‚ÄúAnything seems better than what we have. I must say the cleanup the remediation are huge positives‚Äù Martins said. ‚ÄúBut whatever we‚Äôre bringing to the city must be done right.‚Äù

These are our thoughts and first impressions of the new compact foldable!

Selfie Camera



After months of heavy speculation and leaks Samsung has officially launched the Galaxy Z Fold4 and the Galaxy Z Flip4. In this article we take an early look at the new compact foldable.

But before we do let's talk about the key specs. It features an inner folding 120Hz FHD+ 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X Infinity Flex display. On the outside is a 1.9-inch Super AMOLED secondary screen. Inside is the newly released 4nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 octa-core processor 8GB LPDDR5 RAM UFS 3.1 storage and a larger 3700mAh battery with 25W fast wired charging.

At the back is a 12MP f/1.8 primary camera and a 12MP f/2.2 123-degree ultra-wide angle camera while on the display is a punch hole that houses the 10MP f/2.4 selfie camera.

In the Philippines the price starts at PHP 58990 for 128GB of storage.

Let's dive into the first impressions.



Build Quality/Design

All four colorways



Like the Galaxy S22 Ultra the Galaxy Z Flip4 is made of Armor Aluminum. It was first introduced with the last year's Galaxy Z Flip3 5G and Z Fold3 5G . Samsung claims that it is lighter and ""stronger"" than other aluminum.





The metal frame between the glass back panel and the glass front panel feels solid. While the glass on the outer side and on the display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+. These materials make the phone look premium but make it both slippery to hold and make a fingerprint smudge magnet.





""Improved metal frame"" + Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+





We still recommend wearing a case right away.





The Z Flip4 is IPX8 water resistance rated which means it can survive being submerged 1.5 meters underwater for up to 30 minutes.

Outer screen

On the outer side is the 1.9-inch Super AMOLED secondary screen. Samsung says that they've added more functionality thru software. We'll see.

While on the inner side is the 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X Infinity Flex display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and a 2640 x 1080 resolution.

Samsung has tweaked the bezels around the inner display to be slimmer too.

Both screens are bright that produce images with crisp text vibrant color and plenty of detail.

The crease is just marginally better (a bit better) coming from the Z Flip3. The firm also ""improved"" the ultra-thin glass to resist breaking (only time will tell).

Top and bottom



On top of the phone are antenna lines and a microphone port while at the bottom are more antenna lines a speaker grill a USB-C port and more microphones.





Unlike 2022 foldables from other brands Samsung's flip foldable phone is still not gapless...





In between the two halves is the hinge with the Samsung logo. Samsung says that they've tweaked the design of the hinge to be more durable while reducing the gap between both sides when folded.

Left and right

On the left side of the phone are more antenna lines and the SIM tray while on the right side are the Power button and the volume rocker. The power button doubles as the fingerprint scanner. The volume rocker is also made of metal. Both buttons offer satisfying feedback when pressed.

The Galaxy Z Flip4 measures 165.2 x 71.9 x 6.3 mm when unfolded and measures 84.9 x 71.9 x 17.1 mm when folded. It weighs 187 grams which means it is lightweight for a phone made of metal and glass with added components needed for it to fold. Rear cameras

For cameras It features a dual rear-facing module made up of a 12MP f/1.8 primary camera with Dual Pixel AF and OIS and a 12MP f/2.2 123-degree ultra-wide camera with an LED flash while on the punch hole is a 10MP f/2.4.

Once we obtain a unit for review we will share more details about the camera.

So stay tuned for upcoming camera samples and for our full review.

Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4 Specs Display: 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X Infinity Flex screen w/ 120Hz adaptive refresh rate HDR10+ FHD+ 2640 x 1080 at 426 ppi 1.9-inch Super AMOLED screen w/ 260 x 512 resolution at 302 ppi CPU: 4nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 octa-core processor GPU: Next-gen Adreno GPU RAM: 8GB LPDDR5 ROM: 128GB/256GB/512GB UFS 3.1 Back Camera: 12MP f/1.8 w/ Dual Pixel AF OIS + 12MP f/2.2 123-degree ultra-wide-angle w/ LED flash Selfie Camera: 10MP f/2.4 Battery: 3700mAh w/ 25W wired w/ Super Fast Charging 15W Fast wireless charging 2.0 Wireless PowerShare OS: Android 12 w/ One UI 4.1.1 Connectivity: WiFi 6E a/b/g/n/ac/ax 5G 4G LTE Bluetooth 5.2 OTG NFC GPS GLONASS Galileo BeiDou dual SIM (nano + eSIM) Sensors: Accelerometer light orientation proximity gyroscope sound magnetic pressure Others: Side-mounted fingerprint sensor face unlock stereo speakers UHQ 32-bit/DSD audio Dolby Atmos USB-C Colors: Bora Purple Graphite Pink Gold Blue Dimensions: 165.2 x 71.9 x 6.3 mm (unfolded) 84.9 x 71.9 x 17.1 mm (folded) Weight: 187 g Price: PHP 58990 (128GB) PHP 62990 (256GB) PHP 69990 (512GB)

As of the moment

With the Z Fold4



The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4 is a refinement of last year's Z Flip3. Samsung polished and improved what made the foldable great while tweaking the hardware to be more ergonomic and functional.

It does come with the last Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 and with a larger 3700mAh battery. It even supports the faster 25W SuperFast wired charging.

At first glance apart from the chipset it subtle upgrade over the previous generation.

We will have to see how much better it fares after we've had a unit tested extensively.

Stay tuned until then.

Vestar the largest privately held shopping center owner and manager in the western United States announced that it is moving forward with Phase Two of the highly anticipated Queen Creek Crossing retail development where the town's first Costco is being built. The second phase will include the addition of Ashley Furniture (45000 square feet) Hobby Lobby (55000 square feet) and several restaurant and specialty shops in over 145000 square feet of space.

‚ÄúThis is a significant step in our overall development strategy and we are excited for Ashley Furniture Hobby Lobby and many others to join Costco in Queen Creek Crossing‚Äù said Jeff Axtell executive vice president of Vestar. ‚ÄúThroughout the leasing process we have been strategic to target tenants that fill voids within the community.‚Äù

Now under construction the Queen Creek Crossing development encompasses 31 acres at the northwest corner of Ellsworth and Queen Creek roads. When fully developed it will feature over 400000 square feet of retail space anchored by Costco Ashley Furniture and Hobby Lobby. The development is currently over 80% leased with strong local regional and national tenants including Black Rifle Coffee Sleep Number Smoothie King Gallery Nails and Desert Financial Credit Union. Phase One of the project is expected to open in fall 2022 and Phase Two in fall 2023.

Queen Creek Crossing is one of four ground-up developments in the greater Phoenix area recently announced by Vestar.

The scale in the image indicates 6.27 pounds and the caption on the image read ""I couldn't get it to fit in the box.""

The comments shared u/Stilgrave's appreciation of the gigantic fowl. U/robamiami stated ""Sesame Street Rotisserie Big Bird now at Costco"" and u/Majestic_Location751 commented ""Double helping on the chicken feed that one."" U/MadMex2U called it a ""Barry Bonds chicken meaning pumped full of steroids. Ha"" and u/deviltrombone added ""Its size is exceeded only by its toughness."" Several commenters also added a classic ""that's what she said"" response to u/Stilgrave's caption.

The ingredient in Costco's rotisserie chicken that you should be wary of has nothing to do with this bird's size. Some of the Reddit commenters suggested that the bird may have plumped during cooking if it was not tied during the process. Those commenters might be onto something too as the Premier Foods Group in 2016 explained that chicken plumping using a saline solution is a common practice.

Regardless of whether this particular chicken's size and weight were all-natural or driven by plumping it definitely demanded the attention of everyone around.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvZmVtYWlsL2hvbWVzL2FydGljbGUtMTExMzI4NDEvR3JvY2VyeS1zaG9wcGluZy1Db3N0Y28tRG9vci1uYW1lZC1iZXN0LXJlbm92YXRpb24tZmVhdHVyZS1CZXN0LWhvbWUtaGFja3MtMjAyMi5odG1s0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvaG9tZXMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTEzMjg0MS9hbXAvR3JvY2VyeS1zaG9wcGluZy1Db3N0Y28tRG9vci1uYW1lZC1iZXN0LXJlbm92YXRpb24tZmVhdHVyZS1CZXN0LWhvbWUtaGFja3MtMjAyMi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grocery shopping Costco Door named the best renovation feature: Best home hacks of 2022,"A construction company owner has wowed with what has been dubbed a 'genius' home renovation feature that speeds up the weekly supermarket shop.

The feature can technically be installed anywhere but is the most helpful if the garage and kitchen share a wall.

The small door also has a lock on it to ensure the homeowner's safety if they accidentally leave their garage door open.

'This is absolutely genius' said one woman.

She added 'I won't have to lug my groceries all around my house anymore.'

'There's nothing I hate more than carrying heavy bags up stairs' said another. 'This would be great for my back pain.'

SUPPLIED

The Cambodian securities sector sees tailwinds after the regulator the bourse and the UN‚Äôs capital investment agency for the least developed countries entered into a partnership on development through technical assistance.

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) on ‚ÄúThe Technical Assistance for Promoting the Development of Securities Sector in Cambodia‚Äù was inked to this effect in the capital on August 18 between Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC) director-general Sou Socheat Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX) CEO Hong Sok Hour and UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) executive secretary Preeti Sinha in a ceremony presided over by Ministry of Economy and Finance secretary of state and CSX chairman Hean Sahip.

Under the deal the UNCDF will support the SERC and the CSX in the ‚Äúimplementation of institutional capacity development and human capacity development‚Äù and ‚Äúthe development and regulation of new transboundary products‚Äù according to a joint statement released on August 19.

The UN agency will also ‚Äúfacilitate south-south exchange and peer learning between the SERC and the CSX and similar regulatory institutions‚Äù in ASEAN Plus Three ‚Äì which comprises the 10 ASEAN nations plus China Japan and South Korea the statement said.

It added that the UNCDF will also lend support to the SERC and CSX for the ‚Äúfurther development adoption and implementation of related frameworks and laws pertaining to sovereign and non-sovereign securities‚Äù.

Speaking at the signing SERC‚Äôs Socheat noted that the deal was the latest in a series of MoUs struck with major international institutions such as the World Bank International Finance Corporation Asian Development Bank and regional regulators to promote and enhance the Cambodian securities sector.

‚ÄúCambodia hopes to see the investment return to the pre-pandemic period. Overall this MoU represents the recognition the commitment the synergy and great value of partnership which I am certain will help Cambodia row in the right direction in our commitment towards SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals]‚Äù he said.

He voiced optimism that UNCDF‚Äôs participation in the development of the Cambodian securities sector would lead to the creation of marketable securities products.

‚ÄúI am looking forward to our fruitful cooperations. I am confident that with our concerted efforts the MoU ‚Ä¶ will deliver promising benefits to accelerate the development of [the Cambodian] capital market and help Cambodia overcome the investment trajectories posed by [the Covid-19] pandemic‚Äù he said.

Socheat pointed out that trading activities have gradually picked up signalling a rise in public awareness and that ‚Äúour capital market has become more and more attractive‚Äù.

He said that both the average daily trading volume and value at the CSX in the second quarter of this year ‚Äì ended June 30 ‚Äì jumped nearly four-fold on a yearly basis despite the impacts of Covid-19 and economic slowdown.

The SERC chief earlier noted that as of June 30 a total of 32374 investor IDs have been issued of which 99.52 per cent were individual investors and 86.12 per cent were Cambodian investors.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tamou was initially sin-binned and then sent off by referee Ben Cummins in the final minute of the match after venting his frustrations during the biggest defeat in the Tigers history.

The 32-year-old prop could be heard to utter the words ""f...ing incompetent"" and with no contract for next season a two-match suspension may mean he has now played his last NRL match.

However Tamou told Tigers officials that he wanted to attend the post-match press conference to apologise for his behaviour towards Cummins who he later planned to seek out to issue a personal apology.

‚ÄúFirst of all I apologise for my actions towards Ben Cummins. They [match officials] do a terrific job‚Äù Tamou said. ‚ÄúIt obviously wasn‚Äôt directed at him but the frustrations got the better of me the emotions got the better of me.

‚ÄúI will wear any criticism; I will be accountable for my actions. Obviously the actions aren‚Äôt acceptable towards the jersey the club the players who are trying their backsides off. I probably took the easy way out instead of shaking their hand and looking them in the eye.

‚ÄúI have got to wear that now and wear the criticism. I have got four kids at home and that is how they see their dad act. I‚Äôve let everyone down I‚Äôve let myself down. I am embarrassed. I have let a lot of people down.‚Äù

Storm forward Brandon Smith received a three-match ban earlier this season for abusing referee Adam Gee and with just two rounds remaining before the finals Tamou admitted he was worried that his 303-match NRL career may end on an unwanted note.

‚ÄúI actually didn‚Äôt think of that until someone just mentioned it and my heart did drop‚Äù the 2015 North Queensland premiership winner said.

‚ÄúAgain I have got to be accountable for my actions. It would be a tough way to go out from a game that has given me a lot and that I have dedicated my body to. It is just something I will have to deal with. It‚Äôs my own fault. I‚Äôm shattered.‚Äù

Tamou said he hoped to continue playing next season but his future is uncertain under incoming Tigers coach Tim Sheens.

‚ÄúIt would be great to go around again but I am also a bit of a pessimist and if that time comes where I have got to hang up the boots I‚Äôll be a realist and go out and find a job‚Äù Tamou said.

Tigers interim coach Brett Kimmorley said it was difficult to see how upset Tamou was over his actions and praised the character of the former Test and Origin representative.

‚ÄúIt is extremely tough because you care for your players‚Äù Kimmorley said. ‚ÄúJimmy had his 300th game milestone a few weeks ago and that was an unbelievable achievement for a front-rower a premiership winner to be able to achieve that.

'F***ing incompetent you are.'

'You're off you are sent' Cummins finished.

Roosters recruit Matt Lodge proceeded to burst through the poor Tigers front line defence after Tamou's exit ending the game 72-6.

Tamou was originally sent to the sin bin for telling Cummins to 'f*** off' but was sent off after the outburst

The cricket score punishing was the tricolours biggest win over a side since 1935 as Fox League commentator and former Maroon Corey Parker labelled Wests 'rubbish'.

Tamou was visibly humiliated in the post-game press conference fessing up for his out-of-character tirade .

'First of all I apologise for my actions towards Ben Cummins' the 33-year-old said.

'It wasn't directed at him the frustration got the better of me the emotions ... I will wear any criticism I will be accountable for my actions.'

His vent could cost him the glossy finish to his 14-year career that included steering the Panthers to their first grand final appearance since 2003.

In July Storm utility Brandon Smith was slapped with a three-game suspension for abusing referee Adam Gee calling him a 'cheating bastard'.

Knights centre Dane Gagai controversially avoided suspension after swearing at referee Peter Gough charging the Queenslander with contrary conduct.

Tamou was heard on ref-mic earlier in the game screaming 'f*** off' after knocking the ball on telling Cummins 'you do that every week mate'.

Fans were quick to blast the Cowboys debutant for his immature actions.

'I think James Tamou is counting on a two game suspension so he never has to play for the Tigers again. Smart man.#NRLRoosterTigers' one fan tweeted.

'Not the biggest fan of Ben Cummins but seriously that reaction from James Tamou was just so unnecessary' another wrote.

Others commended the former Blue for taking ownership of his outburst.

'Just listened to James Tamou  Bloke is shattered he has owned his mistake it‚Äôs from pure frustration when your team is getting Flogged he just got it wrong. I‚Äôm hoping no suspension he‚Äôs embarrassed enough' one fan commented.

In the dying stages of the Tigers' record-breaking 72-6 defeat to Sydney Roosters Tamou took exception to a knock-on ruling and was penalised for throwing the ball away in frustration.

NZ-born Tamou unleashed on Cummins and quickly had his sinbinning upgraded to a send-off when he told the veteran referee he was ""f**king incompetent"" on his way off the field.

""I apologise for my actions towards Ben Cummins"" Tamou said after voluntarily fronting at the post-match press conference.

""[The referees] do a terrific job. The frustration got the better of me.

""I'll wear the criticism all week. I've got to be accountable for my actions.

""I've let everyone down. I've let myself down I'm embarrassed.

Yet pay for pharmacists who typically spend six or seven years after high school working toward their professional degree fell nearly 5 percent last year after adjusting for inflation.

Every open training camp practice held at Houston Methodist Training Center has been jam-packed with fans hoping to catch a glimpse of him on the field.

He was dressed in full uniform in the first preseason game against the New Orleans Saints but never played a snap.

On Friday Houston Texans coach Lovie Smith finally gave the fans what they have been waiting for in their 24-20 preseason win over the Los Angeles Rams. A chance to see former LSU cornerback Derek Stingley on the football field in live action against an NFL offense.

‚ÄúThe plan was to play him this game‚Äù coach Smith said in his postgame press conference. ‚ÄúThat was good to get him his first action.‚Äù

Stingley who was selected third overall by the Texans in the 2022 NFL Draft out of LSU wasn‚Äôt tested at all in the Rams‚Äô first drive but saw some action come his way during Los Angeles‚Äôs second offensive possession of the game.

Rams quarterback John Wolford found wide receiver Lance McCutcheon for a 22-yard gain on the first play against Stingley. The rookie was caught staring at the quarterback as the play developed allowing McCutcheon to cross his face and find the soft spot in the zone.

If one thing has stood out in Texans training camp it has been the ability of Stingley to process information quickly and correct mistakes he makes on the field. It was a trait that has stood out to most Texans coaches on the defensive side of the ball.

So it was not surprising to see Stingley have his first pass breakup of the game against McCutcheon as Wolford tried to connect with him again on the third play of the series.

Stingley showed no early lingering effects of the foot injury from 2021 that required him to have Lisfranc surgery and only allowed him to appear in three games.

‚ÄúFirst we just wanted to get him playing time‚Äù said coach Smith when asked to go into detail about the plan for Stingley. ‚ÄúThe plan was to get him 10 plays. I think he got 15 plays. That‚Äôs out of the way. We‚Äôll keep increasing his minutes. He‚Äôs a good football player.‚Äù

The former LSU All-American will have another opportunity to get more snaps on Thursday in the final preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers at NRG Stadium before playing in his first NFL regular season game against the Indianapolis Colts in the Texans 2022 season opener.

DRI,Darden Restaurants,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9idXNpbmVzcy1mb29kL3FyLWNvZGUtbWVudXMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMDgvMjAvYnVzaW5lc3MtZm9vZC9xci1jb2RlLW1lbnVz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why QR-code menus are still around,"New York CNN Business ‚Äî

Of all the pandemic-inspired business adoptions perhaps none is as reviled as the QR-code menus. And yet it persists.

Early in the pandemic restaurants ditched physical menus and instead revived a long-sidelined technology the quick response code. It seemed like a good idea at the time. As restaurants reopened from government-mandated Covid lockdowns restaurant design experts advised them to clear their tables of high-touch items like salt pepper and ketchup bottles. Even the physical menu had to go and thus the QR code ‚Äî which when scanned opens up a digital menu ‚Äî came into vogue.

As it became clear that Covid-19 was unlikely to be transmitted via surfaces however people revealed their true feelings about menu codes. They hated them.

But for restaurants QR codes are more than just a way to offer a contact-free menu. The tech solves problems that restaurants have had for years and are especially painful now like menu printing costs and staff shortages.

It‚Äôs ‚Äúan interesting quandary‚Äù said Robert Byrne director of consumer and industry insights at the restaurant consulting firm Technomic. Should restaurants continue using a technology that diners loathe or revert to the more cumbersome option?

Some have decided that QR-code menus have to go because customers don‚Äôt like them and end up ordering less overall because of them.

Other restauranteurs are holding onto the technology or adding it for the first time because the better option may be to turn it into something people actually want to use.

Indeed improved QR codes may be the future. Square which sells point-of-sales and digital services to restaurants saw the use of its QR codes including ordering capabilities jump 143% among its restaurant customers last year and grown even more this year so far.

‚ÄòBring back menus‚Äô

Bad reviews for QR codes are all over the internet. Last year Slate ran a piece with the headline that demanded ‚ÄúBring Back Menus!‚Äù Subhead: ‚ÄúI am sick of the QR codes.‚Äù Earlier this year a Vice headline declared ‚ÄúF*** QR Codes.‚Äù followed by a plaintive ‚ÄúI just want to hold a menu again.‚Äù

We‚Äôre not talking about a vocal minority of haters here. A recent Technomic survey found that about 88% of respondents said they preferred paper menus to digital QR codes. About 66% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they didn‚Äôt like QR codes because they involve pulling out your phone as soon as you sit at the table. About 57% agreed that using QR codes felt like a chore and 55% agreed that QR codes were hard to read and browse through.

Darden Restaurants (DRI) which owns Olive Garden Longhorn Steakhouse and other chains used the codes early in the pandemic before transitioning to single-use menus and then back to regular ones because of customer preferences a spokesperson said. BJ‚Äôs Restaurants (BJRI) brought back its restaurant menus fall of last year. ‚ÄúOne of the things we‚Äôve heard from our guests is they love having a physical menu‚Äù said CEO Greg Levin during an October analyst call.

Jeremy Wladis president of The Restaurant Group which operates eight restaurants in North Carolina Washington D.C. and New York has also switched back to tangible menus. Early in the pandemic Wladis set up QR codes at his sit-down restaurants in New York City. But he ultimately ditched them.

With a physical menu‚ÄùI think people see more stuff and very likely order more food and have a better experience‚Äù Wladis said. Plus he prefers a real menu himself. ‚ÄúI like to see a whole menu‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm old fashioned.‚Äù

That‚Äôs not to say that there weren‚Äôt advantages to the QR code.‚ÄùIt is easier because you make a menu change and change it in the computer and then [it‚Äôs] done‚Äù he said. BJ‚ÄôS Levin said in October ‚ÄúI think we were all really excited in this business to get to HTML menus because everybody‚Äôs thinking we‚Äôre going to eliminate printing costs.‚Äù

Beyond digital menus

QR codes may be a welcome relief to restaurant operators navigating a difficult environment where ingredients are suddenly expensive or inaccessible and the labor market is tight.

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre updating a menu even with a small degree of frequency that can get expensive‚Äù said Technomic‚Äôs Byrne. Costs increase when an operator is running a chain of restaurants.

And these days maintaining a menu adds another level of complexity noted Bryan Solar general manager of Square for Restaurants.

QR codes let restaurants update pricing and availability quickly and without added costs he said if ‚Äúover the weekend the price of your avocado went up 50 cents.‚Äù Plus with QR codes hosts or servers don‚Äôt have to waste time handing out menus to customers. That may ease the burden on a restaurant that‚Äôs already short-staffed as many are.

Still Solar understands why many people don‚Äôt like digital menus.

‚ÄúWhen people say they‚Äôd like to see the QR code die or they want to see it go away I agree with that sentiment for QR code 1.0‚Äù he said referring to codes that lead to static PDF menus or are otherwise hard to use.

But he said people might actually like digital menus if they‚Äôre more responsive and interactive and can be used to order directly add to their tabs or pay for their meals. ‚ÄúThose are much much much more enjoyable experiences than the zoom in zoom out of a PDF.‚Äù

Waiting to pay for a check is ‚Äúa much larger pain point for consumers‚Äù than reading a menu said Byrne and one that can be solved using similar technology. ‚ÄúLet me pay when I‚Äôm ready to go. And everybody‚Äôs happy.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,

This weekend‚Äôs read is an article from the online news site Vice on John Deere tractors ‚Äî but more specifically about the software that runs on them.

Yes in this day and age tractors ‚Äî which we often envision as the ‚Äúdumbest‚Äù of farm equipment ‚Äî have software. At the low end computers and software do much of the same things as the dozens of embedded computers in our cars: They regulate individual aspects of keeping the engine running smoothly and try to detect issues before they become serious. At the high end they can be more like an autopilot: A tractor can be programmed to plow (or pull a seeder) along a specific path through a field. The software on a tractor has now become essential to its operation and therein lies the problem: John Deere (like many other companies in many other fields) maintains strict control over the software embedded into its tractors and through that software ‚Äúmaintains control of every aspect of its use.‚Äù The company will tell you that when you buy a tractor you own the hardware but you are only licensing the software from it and the licensing agreement for the software that it forces you to sign allows it to exert nearly complete control over the hardware as well.

Most notably John Deere prevents you from making repairs or modifications to the tractor yourself: If the software detects that parts have been added removed or swapped out it will lock itself up (known as ‚Äúbricking‚Äù because the machine becomes a lifeless object just sitting there) until an authorized Deere dealer or repair facility uses a software tool to unlock it. Deere will tell you that this is for safety reasons: It can‚Äôt guarantee the software will work correctly if it‚Äôs operating on equipment other than what it was designed for. While that‚Äôs a valid concern experts will tell you it‚Äôs not really what‚Äôs going on here and that a key part of the company‚Äôs business model i.e. how it makes money is in maintaining a monopoly on repair and maintenance of the equipment it sells. This is not uncommon and it can be traced back decades to a company that upended the shaving-razor market by selling the razor handles cheaply and disposable blades separately: It made its profits not from the razor but from its customers‚Äô steady unending need to buy new blades as the old ones wore out. If you have a Keurig ‚ÄúK-Cup‚Äù coffee maker on your kitchen counter you understand this model.

John Deere forces all of its customers to go to authorized Deere repair facilities and only to those authorized facilities; that causes two big problems for farmers. First it can cause long delays especially if the nearest repair facility is hundreds of miles away. The guy down the road can replace that leaky gasket on your tractor but you still can‚Äôt use it until the Deere guy comes out and unlocks the software again. Second it‚Äôs expensive: The authorized Deere representative often charges hundreds of dollars just to come out and press a couple of buttons on a laptop.

As the Vice article details this has led to many farmers resorting to under-the-table methods to ‚Äújailbreak‚Äù their tractors. There are illicit online forums for sharing the software tools that authorized John Deere dealers and technicians use to unlock diagnose and tune up the company‚Äôs equipment. Some farmers have also replaced the software on their tractors with hacked versions ‚Äî hacked by Ukrainians and sold through an online black market.

There is also a third problem for farmers in the John Deere business model: What happens in the future when the company decides to stop supporting the software on the tractor it sold you ‚Äî or its authorized repair facilities stop fixing that model of tractor? Deere could decide to do that simply to force farmers to spend more money to buy newer tractors. If you can‚Äôt maintain it yourself then a single broken item even a simple one could be enough to ‚Äúbrick‚Äù the entire machine forever.

The Vice article is five years old but essentially nothing has changed in Deere‚Äôs business model over that time. The issue arose in the news this week when at a security conference a hacker demonstrated that he had broken the security system in the John Deere software and exposed the outdated versions of Linux and Windows that the company‚Äôs software is built upon ‚Äî making it easier for farmers to jailbreak their own equipment but also suggesting that hackers with bad intentions could easily sabotage John Deere farm equipment across the global agriculture industry (Deere farm equipment is sold worldwide).

Here‚Äôs the other thing: This isn‚Äôt a problem just for farmers. The lack of a ‚Äúright to repair‚Äù our own purchased devices and the control that companies maintain over things they purportedly ‚Äúsell‚Äù us are issues for all of us. Apple and Google can remotely ‚Äúbrick‚Äù our phones and until recently Apple has maintained a similar death grip on repair of its phones. Most of the major computer-printer companies force you to buy their ‚Äúauthorized‚Äù (read: expensive) ink cartridges and will brick your printer if you install cheaper third-party ink. Any ‚Äúsmart‚Äù device particularly ones that connect to the Internet is susceptible to this same kind of hostage-taking; that includes household appliances tablets and laptops and even cars.

The ‚Äúright to repair‚Äù political movement has gained some traction over the past year but most of us still aren‚Äôt paying attention to how companies ‚Äî and not just the ‚ÄúBig Tech‚Äù behemoths ‚Äî are leveraging software on the things they sell us to force us to keep paying them money.

Jesse Lindeman moved to Yakima from Iowa and bought a lumber company for a whopping $158 in 1920.

Soon after Lindeman and his brother created Lindeman Power Equipment Co. where they built and sold tractors for various companies.

They soon became the John Deere dealer and introduced Deere to the crawler tractors which operates on tracks instead of tires.

""Jesse Lindeman is an exciting thing. He was right here in the Yakima Valley. This is where his business was. He put John Deere on the map with crawlers and the Central Washington Ag Museum gets to actually share that story"" John Kobli who was explaining the Lindeman Archives at the Pioneer Power Show said.

Lindeman's tractors are still used to this day in and out of the U.S.

The answer is $170000. That's how much you'd have now if you'd invested $10000 in Deere (DE 1.69%) 20 years ago. It's a super return for a large-cap company as elephants aren't supposed to be able to gallop. Moreover what's remarkable about Deere's stock performance is its tripling over the last five years. The company has been doing something right because its returns dwarf those of the S&P 500 and its peers like AGCO and CNH Industrial. Here's a look at what makes the agricultural machinery company so unique.

Why Deere's stock has outperformed

There are a few key reasons why Deere has outperformed in recent years:

After half a decade in the doldrums the prices of key crop commodities like soybeans corn and wheat have increased significantly over the last few years (see chart below).

The company's leadership in smart farming solutions has added a significant amount of value to its equipment and kept farmers loyal to Deere's equipment.

Management's acquisition policy has been excellent in building its precision agriculture (smart farming) business and diversifying its end markets by acquiring a major road construction equipment maker Wirtgen in 2017.

As noted above crop commodity prices have risen to historical highs recently which is excellent news for crop farmers. It's also great news for Deere because it encourages farmers to replace aging equipment. It's also timely because it coincides with a period when Deere is aggressively rolling out its precision agriculture solutions -- more on that in a moment.

Great acquisition history

Deere is best known for its large and small agriculture equipment but it also has a construction and forestry segment which contributes handily to profitability. For example the segment contributed $1.5 billion to operating profit in 2021 compared to $2 billion for small ag and turf and $3.3 billion for production and precision ag.

In addition the $5.2 billion acquisition of Wirtgen bolstered Deere's position in road construction machinery and helped diversify its income stream. That's a major plus for investors and the company because it ensures a level of earnings and cash flow. That's important because Deere will need cash to invest in its business even when its core agriculture machinery business is experiencing weak conditions.

Precision agriculture

Deere's acquisition strategy is an instrumental part of its precision ag strategy. Precision ag solutions use real-time data gathered from internet-enabled devices to help farmers make the right decisions in an industry fraught with uncertainty. For example preparing the soil planting nurturing and harvesting are critical decisions that hugely affect crop yield.

Deere's technology solutions are deeply embedded in its hardware. For example it has the technology to control spraying and monitor and control fertilizer application and solutions that use data to guide planting spraying and harvesting. It's a set of solutions Deere built up through organic investment and acquisitions such as the 2017 acquisition of Blue River Technology  creators of ""see and spray"" technology to spray herbicide precisely.

Harvest Profit a provider of farm profitability software was bought in 2020 and Bear Flag Robotics was purchased in 2021. The latter is a developer of autonomous driving technology that can be retrofitted to existing tractors.

Looking ahead

Deere's leadership in precision ag has encouraged peers to follow in its steps and make acquisitions in the space. It combines the right technology at the right time (as crop prices recovered) and Deere is reaping the rewards. Whether $10000 invested in Deere now will lead you to $170000 in 20 years is debatable. However no one will argue that Deere isn't the market leader in an industry (precision ag) that is only getting started in improving global crop yields. As such investors can look forward to more earnings growth in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXJpbGxvLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvanViaWxlZS1vZi10cmFjdG9ycy1mZXN0aXZhbC1yYWlzZXMtbW9uZXktZm9yLWhlcmVmb3JkLW11c2V1bS82NTQxMjA0OTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jubilee of Tractors Festival raises money for Hereford museum,"HEREFORD ‚Äî On Saturday the Deaf Smith County Historical Society Jubilee of Tractors and Festival held its annual event featuring a parade of about 40 antique tractors led by the Hereford High School Mighty Maroon Marching Band at Dameron Park.

Following the parade the antique tractors of various makes and models including John Deere Ford Case Allis Chalmers Oliver Corporation and others were lined up on display for the public to view close-up. Food games a DJ and vendors with various wares on display were available for the whole family to enjoy.

After a two-year hiatus due to COVID-19 the Deaf Smith County Historical Society held its second annual Tractor Jubilee to raise funds for the Deaf Smith County Museum. On display with tickets still available was a classic 1940 John Deere tractor which is being raffled off at the Panhandle Antique Tractor Show coming up Sept. 10 to raise money for the High Plains Children‚Äôs Home Camp Alphi and Heal the City. For more information on the raffle call 806-344-7799.

Ted Ray Coleman president of Panhandle Antique Tractor Association spoke about the event's significance and great crowd turnout to support the region's agricultural history.

‚ÄúOur goal is to promote and preserve early American agriculture and the history of the classic tractors that started it all"" Coleman said. ‚ÄúWe always say that you never talk bad about a farmer with your mouthful.‚Äù

Coleman said the unique thing about this event is its parade of tractors.

‚ÄúYou usually cannot find an event like this especially a parade with only tractors involved‚Äù Coleman said. ‚ÄúMost of the time you have other entries outside of tractors so that makes this event so special and unique. We are so glad to see so many people out to raise money for the museum.""

Lana Bass executive director of the Deaf Smith County Museum emphasized the importance of recognizing the impact of agriculture on the region.

‚ÄúThis is a tribute to the hard work of our farmers and agricultural history in Deaf Smith County‚Äù Bass said.

Delta Air Lines is the only major US carrier not to invest in Boom Supersonic's Overture jet or an eVTOL aircraft.

CEO Ed Bastian told Fox Business that he has ""a lot more questions than answers still"" regarding Overture.

Travel analyst Henry Harteveldt told Insider Delta may buy the aircraft if it sees they can fit into its business strategy.

Large US carriers like American Airlines and United Airlines are placing bets on the aircraft of the future like supersonic jets and electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft but one carrier has not made any investments just yet.

On Tuesday American Airlines announced an order for 20 of Boom Supersonic's Overture aircraft with an option for 40 more. The purchase puts the Texas-based carrier on track to become the largest operator of the ultra-fast plane.

United Airlines is the other US carrier to take interest in the Overture having placed an order for 15 with an option for 35 more in June 2021.

Meanwhile both mainline carriers have also invested in electric aircraft particularly eVTOLs.

American recently placed a pre-order for 250 of Vertical Aerospace's VX4 flying taxis while United has deposited $10 million for 100 of Archer Aviation's ""Midnight"" eVTOLs. United has also invested in Heart Aerospace's ES-19 electric planes.

While American and United are inking agreements with startups promising a new future Delta Air Lines is the only major US carrier not to invest in either. This may suggest Delta has a different vision for its future fleet but Henry Harteveldt travel analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group says that may not be the case.

Instead he told Insider that he gives Delta ""credit"" for taking their time on making decisions.

""There's an opportunity cost for an airline when they're buying airplanes and it doesn't matter what type of aircraft because there's only so much money that a carrier has available to invest"" he said. ""Airlines want to invest wisely to get the best possible return so I don't see any problem with Delta choosing not to order the Overture or eVTOLs.""

There is skepticism about Boom's Overture jet

According to Harteveldt Delta may very well decide to buy a supersonic plane or an electric aircraft in the future but they want to ensure the investment fits its business model and network.

""As far as Boom there is a lot of skepticism within the aviation industry"" he said. ""Right now it doesn't have an engine.""

Delta CEO Ed Bastian confirmed his skepticism about the jet to Fox Business on Tuesday saying he ""has a lot more questions than answers still.""







""Until we are confident that we could actually generate a reliable return from the aircraft that's not where we're investing"" he said.

Delta's Boeing 757-200s may have another 10 to 20 years in them

Harteveldt explained that while Delta does not have orders in for the Overture or eVTOLs they are making decisions that will keep its current fleet flying longer.

Specifically the carrier is retrofitting its Boeing 737-800 Boeing 737-900ER and Boeing 757-200 aircraft with Split Scimitar Winglets made by Seattle-based Aviation Partners Boeing to reduce carbon emissions.

Harteveldt says the inclusion of the 757 is particularly surprising.

""The 757 is an excellent airplane but it is no longer in production and there is a lot of curiosity of the future of the aircraft"" he said. ""But clearly the plane is serving an important role for Delta and they have found a way to keep them flying for another 10 to 20 years.""

""They may not be the greenest planes as the engines are not as fuel-efficient as some of the newer generation ones but Delta is keeping dozens of 757s out of the landfill"" Harteveldt continued.

Delta shouldn't buy certain planes just because its competitors are

It is still possible we will see a Delta order for an eVTOL or Overture in the future Harteveldt said saying if Delta sees either fit its business strategy it will order it. But he emphasized the carrier ""shouldn't feel compelled to order the plane just because other airlines are doing so.""

What matters for Delta is that it finds the aircraft that makes sense for it from a business standpoint from a route and network standpoint and if it makes money for the company and attracts more customers."" he said. ""The race is just starting.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmxpbmVzLWFpcnBvcnRzL2RlbHRhLWFpci1saW5lcy10YWtpbmctY2F1dGlvdXMtYXBwcm9hY2gtdG8tc3VwZXJzb25pYy1qZXRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines Taking Cautious Approach to Supersonic Jets,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelpulse.com/news/airlines-airports/delta-air-lines-taking-cautious-approach-to-supersonic-jets on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmxpbmVzLWFpcnBvcnRzL2RlbHRhLWFpci1saW5lcy10YWtpbmctY2F1dGlvdXMtYXBwcm9hY2gtdG8tc3VwZXJzb25pYy1qZXRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2RlbHRhLWp1c3Qtb2ZmZW5kZWQtaXRzLW1vc3QtbG95YWwtY3VzdG9tZXJzLWFuZC10aGUtcXVlc3Rpb24taXMtd2h5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta just offended its most loyal customers and the question is why,"They went after the money not the customer. (A screenshot from a Delta video.) Chris Matyszczyk/Screenshot

Status.

It's something everyone craves secretly or not.

It's something airlines want customers to have.

It's something airline customers want to feel as they separate themselves from the riff and the raff.

Recently though it seems that too many airline customers have been elevated to exalted levels. Which has left airlines scrambling to please them.

Delta for example has had to restrict how many of its more elevated customers it can allow into its lounges.

And now the airline has quietly pierced their egos in a truly unseemly way.

As the Points Guy reported Delta has demoted its Diamond Medallion members to a frankly painful level. Now they're no longer allowed to board with passengers sporting the very fanciest threads and flying in the fanciest seats. Instead they will be relegated to taking their seats just before the truly d√©class√© of premium economy.

You might chuckle at their pain. Please remember though that many of these Diamond Medallion members are the very corporate travelers airlines claim they crave to see again.

Perhaps that's why Delta attempted to characterize this as ""a minor boarding update"" rather than a crushing of the road warrior's delicate soul.

You express your loyalty time and time again to an airline with the expectation that you'll be getting special treatment for your troubles.

Instead an actual overt -- um minor -- demotion.

May I pause to offer how Delta describes the Medallionists?: ""Medallion Members are our most loyal customers.""

Worse for some will be the airline's excuses -- I'm sorry I meant explanations -- for this sudden move. Delta says it prevents any of these Medallionists from quickly sullying the Economy parts of the plane thereby (supposedly) giving the cabin crew a few more minutes to clean up and prepare after the previous flight.

Some might struggle with this logic. After all priority boarding is given to the frail and families with children. Is Delta saying the the Medallionists sully planes more than say a four-year-old?

Delta's second reason may be slightly more persuasive. Slightly. The airline says there's now so much more congestion at the gate with a plethora of the status-ridden desperate to get on the plane as soon as they can.

This way the airline can -- possibly -- create a little more space. Yet isn't the truth that at so many gates everyone mills around in an entirely unstructured way blocking everyone else who's milling around in an entirely desperate way?

Could it be in fact that the truly monied passengers flying in First Class or Delta One complained about having to board with (to them) the lowly Medallionists?

Also: A Delta customer asked for basic service. Instead a raving Twilight Zone

Delta claims that demoting the Medallionists still means they get a ""preferential boarding experience."" Yes but not as preferential as it used to be. Which can only pierce their sometimes fragile self-worth and make them question their devotion to what used to be America's premium airline.

There's little worse than thinking you've finally made it committing yourself so many times to a brand and then having that feeling punctured never quite to return. Instead of boarding along with the richest those who have paid the most exalted prices for the most comfortable seat possible the Medallionists will watch as they stroll ahead.

I fear disaffection. I fear frustration. I also fear though that Delta doesn't yet have a rival that quite matches its brand image. Although Delta's has swiftly plummeted in recent times from say diamond toward landscape rock.

Perhaps United Airlines will take over the mantle of America's best airline for customer service and sensitive road warrior privileges.

Cody Campbell calls his rapid rise in America‚Äôs hardscrabble oil patch a ‚Äúwild ride‚Äù.

Little more than a decade ago when Campbell was in his late 20s he was looking for his next act. Injury had cut short a brief professional American football career and the 2008 housing crisis had driven him out of the real estate business. It was then that he returned from Indiana to his native Texas and teamed up with a friend John Sellers to start buying up drilling rights in promising oilfields to ‚Äútry to make a little money‚Äù.

Neither men had much experience in America‚Äôs fiercely competitive oil business when they started. But Campbell now 40 years old says his stint in real estate helped as they acquired their first land for drilling. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have any money. We didn‚Äôt have any employees. It was just the two of us. And there were a number of times where we sort of bet it all on individual projects. Somehow it worked out‚Äù he says.

In fact it worked out better than Campbell could have imagined. Through his firm Double Eagle Energy the company he jointly owns with Sellers he has amassed a fortune over the past decade selling oil-producing operations to bigger players. Those deals now total nearly $10bn making Campbell one of the Texas oil patch‚Äôs most prolific dealmakers of recent years.

His breakthrough sale came in 2012 when he sold a cluster of oil and gas wells in Oklahoma for $250mn to the late wildcatter Aubrey McClendon who co-founded and ran Chesapeake Energy the large energy group.

The deals have only grown since. Most recently in 2021 he and his partners who now include private equity company Apollo Global Management sold a business in the Permian basin in Texas one of the world‚Äôs largest oilfields to oil company Pioneer Natural Resources for $6.4bn. That came on the heels of a $2.8bn sale in the same area in 2017 to Parsley Energy an oil and gas producer itself later bought by Pioneer Resources. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a wild ride going from basically just a bootstrap operation where we never knew from week to week whether we were going to make it to doing multibillion-dollar transactions‚Äù says Campbell.

Campbell like others in the Texan oil industry has been investing ‚Äî and taking profits ‚Äî despite mounting global concerns about the impact of fossil fuel emissions on climate change. They have ploughed on even as these worries combined with growing political pressure have pushed many financial investors to reduce their commitment to the industry ‚Äî and even pull out altogether.

In the US the Biden administration has cheered passage of the Inflation Reduction Act the biggest climate bill in the nation‚Äôs history which will channel $370bn into clean energy and electric vehicles over the next decade with the aim of slashing fossil fuel consumption.

President Joe Biden who once promised to transition America ‚Äúaway from the oil industry‚Äù called the bill the ‚Äúlargest investment ever in combating the existential crisis of climate change‚Äù.

At times in the years Campbell was making his fortune it seemed that sharp drops in oil prices would help climate campaigners by driving down fossil fuel production ‚Äî notably at the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in 2020. The consequent lockdowns saw US oil prices even briefly falling below zero hitting a negative $37.6 a barrel as world demand suddenly dried up. Hundreds of oil companies in Texas and across the US went out of business and it was a close-run thing for many more.

Campbell says he and his partners discussed ‚Äúshutting everything down‚Äù at one point during the pandemic but ultimately decided to stick to their original plans. ‚ÄúIt was tough for everybody and we were no different it was real stressful‚Äù he says of the period.

But in the volatile markets that rule the industry prices have since bounced back dramatically. They were already on the rise throughout 2021 as global demand driven by economic recovery was growing faster than producers could bring back supply.

It‚Äôs been a wild ride from a bootstrap operation where we never knew from week to week if we were going to make it to multibillion-dollar transactions

Then in February this year Russia sent its tanks into Ukraine. The war brought havoc to commodity markets and accelerated the surge in global crude prices which rose to $129/b in March the highest level since 2008. Though they have since fallen back to around $100/b prices remain far above the $64/b average for 2019.

In Texas this surge has delivered a bonanza to those such as Campbell that have invested in the shale revolution. Big publicly listed US shale oil producers such as Pioneer Devon Energy and ConocoPhillips proxies for the rest of the shale industry are making more cash than ever before.

Political pressure on the production and use of fossil fuel looms as large as ever as highlighted by the Inflation Reduction Act. But the industry is not short of support in the US especially in the Republican party which dominates Texas. In the summer of 2020 Campbell had an unexpected call from the White House. President Donald Trump who would go on to lose the election that autumn decided to visit one of Double Eagle‚Äôs operations in Midland Texas to signal support for the domestic oil and gas industry.

The ex-president was and is hugely popular in oil country where ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù flags fly and ‚ÄúTrump 2024‚Äù bumper stickers are plastered on the back of pick-up trucks. ‚ÄúHis support for the industry was really critical through that period‚Äù says Campbell of the man who he spent the day with.

As for the outlook now Campbell says that the high oil prices seen this year ‚Äî which he argues were exacerbated but not caused by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine ‚Äî are a sign of things to come.

Companies face difficulties raising funds to develop new oil and gas projects as banks and other investors shy away from the industry over climate concerns argues Campbell. He says that the oil supply picture in the coming years ‚Äúlooks very bleak‚Äù and he expects it to lead to relatively high prices for the foreseeable future ‚Äî which would be a financial boon to producers. ‚ÄúI keep thinking that the capital is going to come back with the high prices but it just seems like people are really hesitant to get back in‚Äù he says.

Billionaire oilman Tim Dunn also remains committed to fossil fuels. A Texan born and bred he has been in the industry since the 1970s and founded CrownQuest Operating based in Midland Texas in the mid-1990s. A well-known Republican he has used his oil wealth to back rightwing Republican candidates in Texas and advance conservative and evangelical Christian causes.

Dunn‚Äôs company like the rest of the industry was transformed when new shale drilling and fracking technologies helped unlock vast crude reserves in the oilfields of west Texas where his group owned vast swaths of land that had been deemed too expensive to produce. The huge Permian basin has turned from a dying oilfield into a juggernaut on global energy markets.

Dunn has expanded the business where he employs two of his sons Luke and Lee as vice presidents rapidly in recent years. It is one of the most active oil and gas drillers in Texas and operates more than 1400 wells turning out more than 115000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of oil and gas. CrownQuest ploughed more than $700mn into developing new wells in 2021 alone.

Analysts and bankers say CrownQuest which is privately held is among the most coveted Permian drillers among the larger companies that look for acquisitions in the area though Dunn has resisted selling so far. While the company keeps its finances under wraps analysts say a sale could command $5bn or more. Dunn credits a focus on ‚Äúmanaging risks‚Äù in a relentlessly turbulent business for the success. ‚ÄúI think that is one reason we have survived and prospered through exceedingly choppy waters‚Äù he says.

For Dunn this year‚Äôs surging prices has added fuel to his firm‚Äôs swift growth. The company which already produces more from the Permian‚Äôs oilfields than US supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron says it expects ‚Äúsignificant production growth‚Äù in the coming years.

Meanwhile for Campbell the price upswing has allowed his latest start-up in the Permian to take advantage of a strong tailwind. In June his Double Eagle raised more than $1.7bn from private equity firms including Apollo and Encap along with other investors to start snapping up more development land in the Permian oilfield.

The fundraising success came despite the dearth of capital in the industry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in growth mode and we have access to capital‚Äù says Campbell of the new venture. He says he‚Äôs hunting for bigger acquisitions in Texan oilfields this time round and has assembled a group of investors that can quickly pull off big transactions. The group is ready even for a $5bn deal he says: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just getting started.‚Äù

The acquisition intent is a big bet that the industry will keep making money despite the government-backed moves around the world to cut emissions and reduce the potentially disastrous effects of climate change.

The International Energy Agency predicted in a landmark report last year that spending on exploring for new oil and gas reserves would have to end now for the global economy to hit a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.

That said its base forecasts still see fossil fuel demand extending far into the future. And this year‚Äôs energy crisis driving fears of fuel shortages has scrambled the climate debate.

Politicians and consumers spooked by high energy prices have shifted their near-term focus from emissions reductions to securing energy supplies ‚Äî even if they are fossil fuels. Despite the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act President Biden has this year asked the domestic oil industry to increase supply to help bring down high fuel prices at the pump even if it means higher emissions. In Europe some leaders now want to soften climate targets.

Hallie Templeton US-based legal director at Friends of the Earth an environmental group slams the Biden administration and the oil and gas industry for continuing to expand oil output in the face of the climate threat. ‚ÄúBiden needs to remove his oil-tinted glasses and start treating oil and gas development with the extreme caution it deserves‚Äù she says.

Hallie Templeton the US-based legal director of Friends of the Earth has criticised the Biden administration for continuing to expand oil output

Some of the oil industry‚Äôs biggest players have started eyeing a shift to cleaner fuels. BP Shell and TotalEnergies are ploughing money into solar projects offshore wind farms batteries and electric vehicle charging networks. Even the American oil supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron seen as more reticent to abandon oil and gas are investing in carbon capture and storage and hydrogen to try to cut their emissions and safeguard their businesses from the energy transition.

Campbell argues that the energy crisis that has roiled the global economy this year is a warning sign if leaders try to pull out of fossil fuels too quickly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm young and I have a young family and I worry about [climate change] too. But I think that there‚Äôs just a physical reality in the world that we need oil and we need natural gas. We‚Äôre seeing right now some of what happens if we don‚Äôt have it‚Äù he says

Only forced impoverishment can deliver us to a 100 per cent renewable future any time soon

Dunn is more scathing of policymakers‚Äô approach to climate change which he argues is being used as cover to extend the reach of government power. He argues they are rushing too fast to get the world off fossil fuels which he says remains central to global wealth and wellbeing. Rather than focus on eliminating oil and gas policymakers should balance the ‚Äúeconomic trade-offs‚Äù of cutting fossil fuel use and the potential harm from climate change. In short they should focus on adapting to a warmer world rather than try to prevent it.

‚ÄúOnly forced impoverishment can deliver us to a 100 per cent renewable future any time soon. Perhaps we should allow policymakers to first convert to this lifestyle and give us a full report on whether they prefer to continue in it‚Äù says Dunn.

Climate activists argue that the rapid drop in the cost of renewables and the risk of climate catastrophe mean a quick transition to cleaner energy is both needed and will ultimately be cheaper than running the global economy on fossil fuels. Yet from the Texas oilfields that transition looks a distant prospect.

Of oil Campbell says ‚ÄúWhen my kids have kids I don‚Äôt know. But certainly for the next couple of decades for the rest of my career it‚Äôs going be something that we need.‚Äù

Early warning of low glucose helps control diabetes.

Suppliers of a device which they say alerts people with diabetes to low glucose levels are working toward government funding for subsidised access and wider use.

The device ‚Äì Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) ‚Äì sends alerts to a smartphone every five minutes 24/7 from a small sensor inserted just under the skin on the stomach or upper arm.

Although the CGM is available to Australians with Type 1 diabetes through a subsidy approved by the government there last month it is not funded in New Zealand where it has been on the market since 2020.

Now the company behind the device New Zealand Medical and Scientific Ltd (NZMS Diabetes) is working with Pharmac (the New Zealand government agency which decides which medicines and related products are subsidised) to change that.

NZMS Diabetes' New Zealand Country Manager Kirstin Brown says while they are happy for Australians living with Type 1 diabetes the company wants to see the same benefits for Kiwis who live with the all-encompassing condition.

Diabetes can be potentially life-threatening and Brown says the device eliminates the need for people to prick their fingers* to take multiple blood samples every day reducing the burden of managing their condition.

""It represents a new standard of care by using the latest technology for monitoring"" she says. ""This gives people peace of mind to know that if their readings are getting too high or too low they have time to act.""

The CGM wirelessly transmits glucose readings every five minutes to a compatible smart device** or receiver and not only provides real-time glucose readings but can send alerts when the levels are too high or drop too low. The sensor is changed every 10 days.

""Many individuals living with diabetes have a constant worry and fear of requiring hospitalisation by falling into a state of hypoglycaemia if their glucose levels drop too much. Up until now the only way they can measure it is by doing a blood sugar test many times a day a process that involves pricking the finger for a blood sample.

""The CGM by contrast provides continuous data tracks where the glucose is heading ‚Äì whether high or low ‚Äì and gives prompts so people can make more informed decisions about their diabetes care"" Brown says. ""Sometimes glucose levels fall quickly and the CGM has an 'Urgent Low Soon' alert which provides a 20-minute advance warning.""

She believes it is vital it becomes as widely available in the community as soon as possible. Up to 250000 New Zealanders have diabetes. About 20000 have Type 1 a form of the illness in which the body stops producing insulin and which is mostly diagnosed in children and CGM is also available for Type 2 diabetes.

Glucose readings can also be shared remotely through a Follow app*** a feature Brown says benefits lifestyle choices which can be especially significant for children. When a child is not at home people like their parents and grandparents can receive readings on their phones with up to 10 followers receiving glucose data.

""It means kids can have sleepovers or go on school camps without their parents wondering what their glucose levels might be"" she says. ""One teenage boy who uses the device loves both the technology and the freedom it gives him; he's very active in sports and CGM means he can worry less but live more.""

The CGM can be purchased direct from NZMS Diabetes: ""People don't need a script but we do recommend they talk to their doctor or medical advisor before using it if they want.""

Brown says it can also be trialled so people can use it and see how it works for them by purchasing a 90-day pack or through a year's subscription. NZMS Diabetes also has a 24/7 technical support line people can call if they have any questions or concerns.

This will make Prosus the sole owner of Brazil-based delivery platform iFood.

The acquisition is worth up to EUR1.8 billion. ‚ÄúThe consideration represents an equity multiple of over 5 times on the investments over the life of the joint venture‚Äù Just Eat highlighted.

‚ÄúThe contingent consideration may become payable if the food delivery sector re-rates on a GMV and gross profit multiple basis over the next twelve months‚Äù said Prosus.

As part of the transaction Just Eat will buy IF-JE Holdings BV‚Äôs 49% interest in El Cocinero a Cuerda SA for no additional consideration.

El Cocinero a Cuerda is a holding company of Sindelantal a restaurant delivery app run by iFood that ceased its operational activities in December 2020.

Prosus said: ‚ÄúThe transaction is consistent with Prosus‚Äô strategy to invest where it has high conviction and is a natural next step in the long-standing relationship between Prosus and iFood. Prosus believes this represents a great opportunity to secure full ownership of a high performing cornerstone asset in the attractive Brazilian Food Delivery sector.‚Äù

Just Eat said the deal needs shareholder approval and believes the sale to be in the best interests of the firm.

‚ÄúJust Eat Takeaway.com remains focused on improving its profitability and on a disciplined allocation of capital. It will retain the transaction proceeds to maintain its balance sheet strength and to service repayments of its upcoming debt maturities‚Äù Just Eat said.

Earlier that month after only five days at Wesleyan University in the US Choi decided she needed to leave.

‚ÄúI was having really bad depression and anxiety‚Äù the 19-year-old poet shared adding that at first she resisted treatment. ‚ÄúI could have just been ... extremely miserable and gone through the four years.‚Äù

But her mum insisted saying ‚ÄúI think you need help. And I think now is the time to do this [rather] than forcing yourself through college ... You need to go.‚Äù

Thinking she would only leave for one semester Choi heeded her mother‚Äôs advice and ended up taking a year off from university. She worked with therapists to unravel the childhood trauma underlying her condition ‚Äì from being bullied at school to being raised by parents with undiagnosed and untreated mental illness. To process everything the teen wrote poetry and created art.

‚ÄúI would come home from treatment and didn‚Äôt have anything else to do. So I would make art and that was a huge part of my recovery‚Äù she said adding that many of these poems ended up in her book Farewell to Childhood published by Bottlecap Press in May.

Born to parents who emigrated from South Korea to the US and then to Hong Kong where she was born Choi writes succinctly and candidly about depression self-worth body image and trauma. Her poetry is often accompanied by simple yet powerful doodles that invoke the tender earnestness of childhood.

The artist posts her work on Instagram where she has more than 80000 followers. With three poetry books under her belt and a fledgling YouTube channel and podcast Choi is comfortable using social media as an outlet for her most intimate thoughts.

‚ÄúEverything I write is so personal ... I think my emotions and my writing [are] best when I‚Äôm being as honest as I can be‚Äù she said.

Long before tens of thousands of people would discover her work online and relate to her sincere messages about mental health Choi‚Äôs earliest writings at the age of 11 were songs inspired by Taylor Swift.

‚ÄúI loved how open she was about her emotions. I thought that was amazing because no one in my family was like that‚Äù she said.

Though the teen admitted her song lyrics were ‚Äúso bad‚Äù it set the foundation for how she would approach creative expression.

As she shifted from writing music to poetry Choi kept her work to herself. But when she was in Year 10 at Chinese International School the budding poet told an English teacher about her writing and he encouraged her to make a book.

How an iPad changed everything for artist Sophia Hotung

‚ÄúI took old poems I‚Äôd already written. I handmade all these pages of artwork and poetry and one of the teachers helped me get self-published‚Äù Choi said of her first book Growth. ‚ÄúSince the secret was out I was like: ‚ÄòCool let‚Äôs keep it going.‚Äô‚Äù

Initially she only posted her writing on a private Instagram page. Then one day in her final year of secondary school in 2020 she felt inspired to share a poem on a public account. After positive feedback from friends she continued posting poems collages and short films she made.

Unexpectedly her followers started to grow: one of her collages was reposted by another artist on Instagram and she wrote a poem for the US-based teen-run magazine All My Friends. Los Angeles Magazine even featured her art in a story about Gen-Z publications.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just crazy to me that people actually look at [my account] and read it and relate to it and enjoy it‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLike [it] blows my mind.‚Äù

Despite her success online Choi is determined not to make art her career.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard when you make it a financial thing‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to do that with film and art and writing because I know that can be so stressful.‚Äù

She has expressed this on her account ‚Äì in bright angry red font a post from May notes the challenges of not equating ‚Äúlikes‚Äù on social media to acceptance: ‚ÄúI hate my art because not enough people tapped it twice and isn‚Äôt that hilarious?‚Äù

The Hong Kong artist putting a lighter touch on the city‚Äôs news

So instead of focusing solely on her creative pursuits the teen plans to study psychology this autumn at Columbia University‚Äôs School of General Studies which is tailored for non-traditional students who need more flexibility with schooling.

‚ÄúGoing through treatment inspired me to [study] psychology because I met so many amazing therapists ... It would mean so much for me to dedicate my life towards helping other people in similar situations‚Äù she said.

While Choi has no concrete plans for her future she said she would love to specialise in teen mental health and bring that knowledge to Hong Kong.

‚ÄúMany of us get anxiety in Hong Kong because we‚Äôre so focused on the short-term plan ... The way school is structured you‚Äôre forced to think about college the next year or even just the next test‚Äù she said.

As she learns how to cope with mental illness and build healthier relationships with herself and her family people comment on her posts asking if she will run out of things to write if she is happy.

But the artist said she was comfortable with change and flexible with whatever direction her work could take.

‚ÄúMy account is about me and sharing my story. And that might change over time ‚Äì that will change over time‚Äù she said.

Written in pink crayon lettering a post from July reads: ‚ÄúToday wasn‚Äôt a great day.

People tend to shop at Dollar General for a handful of reasons. A good percentage of the items in-store are either inexpensive or discounted making the chain accessible to shoppers who are careful with their money and are sensitive about price points. And because of the way Dollar General's business is built Dollar General could well be the only retail option in town as most of their stores are built in what are described as ""food deserts"" aka areas where residents have limited access to grocery stores or markets.

But as it turns out food deserts are lacking in healthcare opportunities too. So in August of 2021 Dollar General's then-CEO Todd Vasos said the company would be looking to expand its offerings into a completely new field. During that particular earnings call Vasos said (via NBC) ""What we're going to be squarely focused on ... are those services that rural America today especially doesn't have access to. We talk a lot about grocery deserts or food deserts. There's as equal health care deserts out there across the U.S. and we're in all of these communities.""

To Dollar General the expansion means carrying more over-the-counter medication as well as nutrition and health aids.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiczE3LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vcnRoLWNhcm9saW5hLW5ld3MvcGhvdG9zLXJlbGVhc2VkLWFmdGVyLW5jLWRvbGxhci1nZW5lcmFsLWFybWVkLXJvYmJlcnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Randolph County armed robbery at Dollar General photos of suspect released,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.cbs17.com/news/north-carolina-news/photos-released-after-nc-dollar-general-armed-robbery/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiczE3LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vcnRoLWNhcm9saW5hLW5ld3MvcGhvdG9zLXJlbGVhc2VkLWFmdGVyLW5jLWRvbGxhci1nZW5lcmFsLWFybWVkLXJvYmJlcnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzYwMzA2MTUvZG9sbGFyLWdlbmVyYWwtZGVhbHMtcHVycGxlLWRvdC_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9tb25leS82MDMwNjE1L2RvbGxhci1nZW5lcmFsLWRlYWxzLXB1cnBsZS1kb3QvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I‚Äôm a Dollar General superfan ‚Äì check the colored dots on the tags this weekend for deals as low as $1...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 410 Client Error: Gone for url: https://www.the-sun.com/money/6030615/dollar-general-deals-purple-dot/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzYwMzA2MTUvZG9sbGFyLWdlbmVyYWwtZGVhbHMtcHVycGxlLWRvdC_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9tb25leS82MDMwNjE1L2RvbGxhci1nZW5lcmFsLWRlYWxzLXB1cnBsZS1kb3QvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL3ZpZGVvLXNob3dzLW55Yy1kb2xsYXItc3RvcmUtc2hvcGxpZnRlcnMtcHV0dGluZy13b3JrZXItaW4tY2hva2Vob2xkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video shows NYC dollar-store shoplifters putting worker in chokehold: cops,"A duo trying to steal merchandise from a Bronx dollar store was caught on video putting a 23-year-old female worker in a chokehold last week ‚Äî the third violent robbery at the shop in less than a year.

Despite recent social media backlash for upping their prices to $1.25 after a 35-year reign as one of the only true dollar stores (per CNN) Dollar Tree is still a premiere destination for discounted goods. Offering everything from best-selling novels and cat toys to candles and shampoo Dollar Tree is a frugal oasis with a buffet of miscellaneous merchandise for deal finders and couponers.

As inflation worsens America's food crisis even top earners are turning to food banks and discount grocers to get their meals at an affordable rate (per Fox Business). For the millions of families and individuals currently strapped for cash Dollar Tree is a great alternative to overpriced supermarkets. The discount variety store even offers name brand items like Nature Valley protein bars Old Bay hot sauce and Olive Garden's signature Italian dressing. While Eating Well lists items like Green Giant sliced carrots and Honey Nut Cheerios as some of Dollar Tree's healthier items there are also plenty of items in the food section that skimp on quality ingredients in exchange for that revered $1.25 price tag.

YouTube creator Sensational Finds dedicates her channel to sharing discount shopping tips. But in her recent YouTube video she adds Dollar Tree's imitation vanilla extract to her ""don't buy"" list.

The woman police are looking for was described as approximately 5 feet 6 inches tall 220 pounds with a heavy build and long black hair in braids.

The man police are looking for was described as approximately 5 feet 4 inches tall with a slim build bald head and gray facial hair.

Mendine Kabore 23 who moved to the city from Burkina Faso in 2019 recounts that she‚Äôs been cursed spit at threatened punched and choked. The $17-an-hour assistant manager had her wig pulled off ‚Äî and routinely wrestles dollar-store desperados who may well have picked the store shelves clean by now if it weren‚Äôt for her determination to stop them.

On Aug. 14 she said she called the police nine times regarding shoplifters ‚Äì and that was on a rare shift when the Webster Avenue Family Dollar had a security guard working. He provided little deterrence.

The police usually arrive late after the thieves have already made off with the goods she lamented.

‚ÄúI called them nine times that day. About nine different people‚Äù Kabore told the Daily News. ‚ÄúIt took 15 to 20 minutes [for police to show up].‚Äù Kabore was the victim of three other violent assaults that day.

A fourth woman spat at her. ‚ÄúPeople always do that‚Äù Kabore said.

The other six calls were to report thefts from the store near E. 168th St. in Concourse Village. The store is only staffed with two people at the cash register.

A video of the first violent encounter that day starts with Kabore in a familiar pose one hand on her hip and the other arm blocking the door.

A man wearing a bucket hat holding a plastic bag full of merchandise she says he didn‚Äôt pay for can be seen on the security footage trying to exit.

She gives him a gentle push to his chest and after a brief standoff she finally grabs the bag of ill-gotten goods and tries to tug it out of his hand. The thief and the employee pull the bag back and forth until Kabore throws the man to the ground using a textbook rear body lock takedown. The shoplifter seems to smell defeat and goes slack allowing Kabore to empty the contents of his bag on the floor and show him out.

The devoted Muslim immigrant who is currently in school and hopes one day to be an emergency room nurse lives in a two-bedroom apartment with her parents and three sisters ages 2 through 21.

Mendine Kabore left with her mother.

‚ÄúI came here to study‚Äù said Kabore. ‚ÄúMy dad was here first so we can finish school right here.‚Äù

Round two at her job came about an hour and a half later when she saw a woman stuff merchandise in her black duffel bag and then bypass the cash register.

Video shows again Kabore posted at the door and again with hand on hip she blocked the door. Quickly the shoplifter pulled the purloined product out from under her shirt behind her back and tossed it on the ground but Kabore still wouldn‚Äôt budge.

The customer appears to menace Kabore with something sharp and the employee grabs the woman‚Äôs wrist and they begin to grapple.

After several seconds when it becomes clear the woman isn‚Äôt going to get through the door the shoplifter backs away from the front door opens her duffel bag and tosses all of the stolen products on the floor.

‚ÄúWhen you try and stop them they try to violate‚Äù Kabore told the News adding that she always tries to prevent thefts. ‚ÄúSome other people when they work here they don‚Äôt care. I feel differently because in my country people don‚Äôt steal like that.‚Äù

She said you can identify a thief in Burkina Faso because shopowners usually cut the finger off when they catch them.

‚ÄúWhen I see theft I feel so bad. That stuff is not my stuff yes but I‚Äôm working here and I‚Äôm working here to go to school. If this stuff is not here I‚Äôm not gonna get a job. If they close the store I‚Äôm jobless. How am I going to pay my school?‚Äù

The last violent attack of the day occurred at 3:30 p.m. when a man and woman came into the store and started filling their granny cart with food juice frozen meals cleaning stuff towels and bedsheets police said.

When they tried to leave there was Kapore ready for action.

‚ÄúCan you please put back the merchandise before you go‚Äù Kabore said she asked in her soft voice.

Store footage shows her taking on the woman shoplifter as the security guard hustles the man out the front door.

Kabore and the woman get into a tug-of-war with her. At one point in the wild melee the female robber wrapped her arms around the head-strong employee from behind and put her in a chokehold.

The dollar-store desperados were caught on video ganging up on Kabore slapping and punching her.

Eventually the duo fled the store.

The battle proved too much for the security guard who was on his first day on the job.

‚ÄúHe got scared and left the store‚Äù she told The News.

He later said he was going on a break and never came back.

‚ÄúI understand him. It‚Äôs not safe‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt know something like that would happen. He was surprised and scared.‚Äù

Medics treated her at the scene and she went back to work to open the store the next day.

‚Äú[Burkina Faso] is not that dangerous‚Äù Kabore said comparing her home country with the Bronx. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt attack like that. Not like here. Here they have guns and they walk with knives and everything. People don‚Äôt have guns like that except for police people.‚Äù

Mendine Kabore 23 who was assaulted by multiple shoplifters over the course of a day at a Bronx Family Dollar.

When asked how often violence happens in the store responded ‚ÄúI have to count.‚Äù Then she pulled out her phone full of security videos.

She did admit that terrorism in her home country is a huge issue and kills many people especially in villages.

Kabore said she may have to reconsider how she approaches thieves.

‚ÄúI put myself in danger. I feel so bad‚Ä¶if something happened to me if I die they can replace me here in this job but not in my family.‚Äù

On Sunday as she worked and spoke to reporters who had come to talk to her about crime a man came in who had been caught shoplifting before.

She paused speaking to the press to shoo him out.

‚ÄúGo get out!‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe knows I‚Äôm not going to let him take anything.‚Äù

On Jan. 12 a shoplifter blasted another worker with pepper spray at the store and on Oct. 25 a crook used a boxcutter to slice a 29-year-old store worker‚Äôs chest outside the store after the thief made off with $59 in goods cops said.

Grand larceny in the 42nd Precinct is up 200% from last year petty larceny spiked 27.8%."

Already last summer the company had been shutting some of their locations and limiting deliveries but citing poor sales by early spring a decision was made to pull the plug on all 29 locations in the country.

The question is what kind of market research did they do before expanding into Italy? Opening a pizza franchise in Italy is like the proverbial ‚Äúbringing coal to Newcastle‚Äù a pointless or redundant operation. Did the CEO‚Äôs really think that given a choice of artisanal freshly-made pizza in the country that invented it the customer would choose the American commercially-made knock-off?

When news broke of Domino‚Äôs downfall in Italy it quickly spread on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook with many commentators quipping and joking that the closure should surprise no one. Some were more than just surprised: ‚ÄúAs someone who works at Domino‚Äôs the fact that Domino‚Äôs thought they had any chance whatsoever in Italy is astounding.‚Äù

Underlining the issue of cultural authenticity when interviewed on a Rome street Bologna resident Samuele Lacucci says in a Youtube video: ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs like me going to England to make fish and chips!‚Äù Another joked: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always so heartwarming to see a corporation fail to destroy the uniqueness of something as preserved as Italian pizza. American pizza should just stay in America.‚Äù

Italy is proud of its culinary heritage and pizza is its national treasure a veritable symbol of the Bel Paese. This is a nation that takes its food seriously. It‚Äôs not by chance that the Slow Food movement that went on to become a beacon for foodies all over the globe was founded by an Italian Carlo Petrini. Nor is it by chance that Italians put a premium on using only the freshest ingredients‚Äîand that Campania the region just south of Rome‚Äìis the epicenter of mozzarella production. The hybrid ‚Äúabominations‚Äù like pineapple pizza concocted in the US or elsewhere may appeal to young people who aspire to be cool and outward-looking but it would take more than that to overcome centuries of tradition and to keep Domino‚Äôs in business in Italy.

Starbucks represents a similar conundrum. Can an international franchise that has adulterated the standards for a cappuccino or an espresso on a global level adopting ridiculously inappropriate Italian words like grande and venti to create an Italian ‚Äúatmosphere‚Äù be successful in a country where there is a ‚Äúbar‚Äù (caf√©) on virtually every street where the ‚Äúatmosphere‚Äù is genuine and the espresso and cappuccino authentic?

Italian coffee culture originated in Venice in the 16th century with the import of the product through the port and later in 1720 with the opening of the first coffee shop. Starbucks was founded in Seattle in 1971 as a coffee bean purveyor.

Just as there may be the homesick tourist who orders a Domino‚Äôs pizza looking for a taste of home there may be some who duck into Starbucks for the exact same ‚Äùventi‚Äù they get on a daily basis but any savvy and sophisticated traveler would know that the real thing is not found in a franchise that operates in every corner of the world‚Äìgiving you exactly the same product‚Äìbut where the pizza or the espresso were born and are venerated. Even more relevant is the idea that in fact we travel to widen our horizons and embrace new experiences. Searching for what you already had at home is no more than armchair travel at a premium cost.

While for some ‚Äúfusion‚Äùis the best thing to have happened to cuisine‚Äìan exciting way to put globalization on your plate so to speak‚Äìfor others it‚Äôs a scourge that has led to some serious cultural (mis)appropriation like Domino‚Äôs marketing their globalized commercialized pizza in a country that prizes authenticity above all else. For some it‚Äôs a way to embrace all the buzz words popular today‚Äìcultural inclusivity chief among these. For others not so much.

Meridien Mach recalls how as a child she was ashamed to bring her b√°nh m√¨ sandwich to school because frequently her classmates would express disgust at the unfamiliar sight and smell of the Vietnamese specialty. Recalling the incident in the present she is now ashamed not of the sandwich but to have been ashamed of her culture. Yet ‚ÄúNow I am seeing restaurants not owned by Vietnamese Americans selling ‚Äòb√°nh m√¨‚Äô and modifying it to have American cold cuts or pork belly rather than the traditional meats from Vietnamese cuisine and the French p√¢t√©. When restaurateurs take cultural foods and modify them they disrespect the culture and those that were ostracized for it. When making another culture‚Äôs food inauthentically we fail to respect the culture it originated from reinforce stereotypes and thus contribute to oppression known as food cultural appropriation.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs some good advice given by industry insiders to restaurateurs to help them avoid cultural appropriation: ‚Äúremember that this food can be an important part of the identities of many people. You may not share their experiences. You do not share the exact kind of connection to this food.‚Äù I wonder if a franchise like Domino‚Äôs or Starbucks has ever heard of this advice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vcmVhbHJlc2VhcmNoZXIuY29tL21lZGlhLzY4LXBlcmNlbnQtc2F5LWxvY2FsLWl0YWxpYW4tcGl6emEtdGFzdGVzLWJldHRlci10aGFuLWRvbWlub3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,68% Say Local Italian Pizza Tastes Better Than Domino's,"Italy is commonly associated as the home of Pizzas.

(Representational)

A woman in Northern Ireland who was asked her age at a Domino's Pizza delivery driver job interview won ¬£4250 (about Rs. 3.7 lakh) in compensation. According to a report in BBC the woman Janice Walsh thought she was passed over for the position because of her age and sex. She asserts that the interviewer at the Domino's Pizza franchise in Strabane County Tyrone questioned her about her age at the outset of the conversation.

She accused the Strabane franchise and its previous owner Justin Quirk of discrimination. Mr Quirk offered Ms Walsh ¬£4250 in compensation and apologised for the incident.

Ms Walsh claimed that during her interview the first thing that was brought up was her age. Eventually she discovered that her application for the position had been unsuccessful. She said that after being rejected for the job the interview and the age-related issue came to her mind. She added that she thought the interview panel's choice was impacted by her age.

Then Ms Walsh sent a Facebook message to the store explaining that she felt she had faced age discrimination. She received a call from an interview panelist who apologised. She was informed that they were unaware it was inappropriate to ask about someone's age during a job interview.

Later during a conversation with another Domino's employee Ms Walsh learned that younger workers between the ages of 18 and 30 were typically more suited for the nature of the work.

Ms Walsh thought that she was also a victim of gender-based discrimination. She claimed that she was passed up for a driving role because she was a woman. She claimed that Domino's kept running job ads for drivers even after the interviews.

The Northern Ireland Equality Commission backed Ms Walsh in her legal battle. The chief legal officer for the commission Mary Kitson emphasised the significance of businesses of all sizes being familiar with the fundamentals of equality law. She said that to keep the employer on the right side of the law those involved in recruitment and selection should be aware of how people are protected by the legislation.

According to the BBC report in a statement Domino's claimed that because they used a franchising system store employment and recruitment was the franchisee's duty.

The franchisee in question then left the system due to other events and the Strabane store is now run by new management according to them. They added that they took a lot of pride in having a diverse and inclusive workforce.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmxrL2Z0LWxpdGUvRG9taW5vLXMtU3JpLUxhbmthLW9wZW5zLTM3dGgtb3V0bGV0LWluLU1hdGFyYS82LTczODg4NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domino‚Äôs Sri Lanka opens 37th outlet in Matara,"The Domino‚Äôs Matara team ceremonially opening the outlet

And a bonus for lemonade lovers: Each candle comes with a promo code you can redeem for free lemonade at your local Chipotle.

Chipotle superfans can purchase a candle for $28 on the company‚Äôs merchandise website while supplies last.

The brand has acknowledged the lemonade trick before tweeting ‚Äúin this house we love and appreciate people who don‚Äôt put lemonade in their water cups‚Äù in 2018.

For Chipotle it seems the real goal of playing into the water cup meme isn‚Äôt to cut down on lemonade theft so much as to connect with fans.

‚ÄúSocial is the premier destination for us to listen to and engage with our superfans‚Äù said Chris Brandt Chipotle‚Äôs chief marketing officer in the release. ‚ÄúWhen they see these lighthearted tributes to social chatter and fan behavior they feel even more connected to Chipotle.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9idXNpbmVzcy9iZXJrc2hpcmUtaGF0aGF3YXktb2NjaWRlbnRhbC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway wins OK to buy 50% Occidental stake,"A US energy regulator on Friday gave Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) the company controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett permission to buy up to 50% of oil company Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Corp‚Äôs common stock.

Occidental‚Äôs share price soared 9.9% closing up $6.41 at $71.29 after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said letting Berkshire add to its 20.2% stake was ‚Äúconsistent with the public interest.‚Äù

Berkshire had applied to increase its stake on July 11 saying it would not hurt competition undermine regulatory authority or boost costs for consumers. FERC regulates the interstate transmission of electricity natural gas and oil.

The share price of Houston-based Occidental has more than doubled this year benefiting from rising oil prices following Russia‚Äôs Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Berkshire began buying Occidental shares four days later.

Buffett‚Äôs Omaha Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock which helped finance the 2019 purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion.

Berkshire also ended June with a $23.7 billion stake in a larger oil company Chevron (CVX).

‚ÄúBuffett is taking advantage of stock market participants who are foolish about the oil and gas industry and consider it a dead business‚Äù said Cole Smead president of Smead Capital Management Inc in Phoenix which owns Occidental and Berkshire shares. ‚ÄúBuffett thinks it can make him wealthy.‚Äù

Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to Buffett‚Äôs assistant.

Occidental spokesman Eric Moses said the higher ownership limit was ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù because the company owned assets subject to FERC regulation. It said the prior limit was 25%.

FERC‚Äôs authorization does not require Berkshire to buy any Occidental shares.

Some investors and analysts have nonetheless said Berkshire could eventually buy Occidental diversifying an energy portfolio that includes several utilities electricity distributors and renewable power projects including wind.

Buffett completed one of his biggest acquisitions the $26.5 billion purchase of the BNSF railroad in 2010 after Berkshire had amassed a 22.6% stake.

Takeover?

Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he ‚Äúliked Occidental more as a wholly-owned subsidiary under the Berkshire umbrella‚Äù because it would reduce Occidental‚Äôs costs to access capital and reduce exposure to commodity markets volatility.

Independent oil analyst Paul Sankey added that Occidental can benefit from the expanded tax credit for carbon-capture projects included in the Inflation Reduction Act signed this month by President Joe Biden.

‚ÄúI can see him taking the whole thing private‚Äù Sankey said referring to Buffett.

Smead in contrast said Buffett is unlikely to buy all of Occidental soon and can instead buy more shares on the open market at lower prices than in a full takeover.

‚ÄúIn the long run he may but you don‚Äôt file something like this with FERC if you‚Äôre planning it in the next six months‚Äù Smead said.

Berkshire ended June with $105.4 billion of cash and equivalents even after buying a net $45.2 billion of stocks in the year‚Äôs first half.

Buffett has pledged to keep $30 billion on hand. Occidental‚Äôs market value was about $66 billion after Friday‚Äôs run-up.

Berkshire owns more than 90 companies outright including Geico car insurance See‚Äôs Candies Dairy Queen ice cream and several manufacturing businesses.

At Berkshire‚Äôs annual meeting on April 30 Buffett said he began buying Occidental shares after reviewing an analyst presentation.

He also expressed confidence in Chief Executive Vicki Hollub who has been reducing Occidental‚Äôs debt.

‚ÄúShe says she doesn‚Äôt know the price of oil next year. Nobody does‚Äù Buffett said. ‚ÄúBut we decided it made sense.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9idXNpbmVzcy9tYXJrLXp1Y2tlcmJlcmctbWV0YXZlcnNlLWhvcml6b25zLW1lbWVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVRodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL2J1c2luZXNzL21hcmstenVja2VyYmVyZy1tZXRhdmVyc2UtaG9yaXpvbnMtbWVtZXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mark Zuckerberg responds to metaverse memes with a redesign,"New York CNN ‚Äî

Mark Zuckerberg in response to a torrent of critical memes mocking the graphics of Meta‚Äôs newest project has heard his critics ‚Äì and changed his selfie.

Zuckerberg debuted Horizon Worlds a virtual reality social app in France and Spain earlier this week sharing a somewhat flat goofy digital avatar posed in front of the Eiffel Tower and rolling green hills.

The internet immediately jumped in mocking what many users viewed as (hopefully) preliminary graphics for a venture that Meta has spent at least $10 billion in the last year.

New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose compared the graphics to ‚Äúworse than a 2008 Wii game‚Äù on Twitter. Slate used the term ‚Äúbuttcheeks.‚Äù Twitter was less kind: ‚Äúeye-gougingly ugly‚Äù and ‚Äúan international laughing stock‚Äù popping up.

Many compared the Metaverse design to early 90‚Äôs graphics and pointed out how lifeless and childish the Zuckerberg selfie looked. It quickly won the designation ‚Äúdead eyes.‚Äù

Well Zuckerberg has apparently seen the memes because on Friday he announced there are major updates coming ‚Äì along with new avatar graphics. On Facebook and Instagram Zuckerberg posted a photo of his more advanced-looking avatar.

‚ÄúI know the photo I posted earlier this week was pretty basic ‚Äì it was taken very quickly to celebrate a launch‚Äù Zuckerberg wrote in the caption adding the graphics in Horizon ‚Äúare capable of much more‚Äù and promising that it will be ‚Äúimproving very quickly.‚Äù

Zuckerberg added he will share more details at Connect the company‚Äôs annual conference which took place in October last year.

Facebook planned to spend at least $10 billion in 2021 on Facebook Reality Labs dedicating significant resources toward its augmented and virtual reality products and services in last year‚Äôs third quarter results.

There‚Äôs a good chance you aren‚Äôt disposing of your AA batteries properly. But you may not be to blame.

There‚Äôs no shortage of conflicting messages on what to do with your dead alkaline batteries which include AA AAA C D and 9-volt. Governments and battery makers don‚Äôt have consistent and clear policies for disposing of the alkaline batteries that power many of our small electric devices like remote controls flashlights clocks and toys. They even differ depending on where you live.

Typical alkaline batteries like AAs include steel zinc manganese potassium and graphite according to Energizer which sells alkaline batteries. Energy is generated when the zinc and manganese interact.

Manganese is an essential nutrient but at high levels it can cause adverse health impacts. Former manganese miners and smelters have suffered permanent neurological damage. With any battery there‚Äôs risk of chemicals leaching into soil surface water and ground water. Polluted water and crops can lead to diseases like cancer. But alkaline batteries are not especially toxic compared to other battery types.

The Environmental Protection Agency acknowledges that in most communities batteries can be safely put in the trash. But it recommends sending your alkaline batteries like AAs to a battery recycler. Which doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you can throw the batteries in your regular recycling bin.

A huge exception to this is California which classifies batteries as hazardous waste. The state says they‚Äôre hazardous because of the metals toxic and corrosive materials that batteries contain. Residents are instructed to take AA and all batteries to hazardous waste disposal facilities. No other state also classifies batteries as hazardous waste. But some local governments call for recycling AA batteries and have programs to do so.

The District of Columbia tells residents to drop off AA batteries for recycling at a designated location but not in their recycling bins. Seattle residents are encouraged to take their AA batteries to hazardous waste facilities.

‚ÄúTossing a handful of batteries in the trash may not seem like a big deal it adds up: around 180000 tons of batteries are discarded in the U.S. every year‚Äù the city cautions.

Others places like Chicago refuse to take alkaline batteries at recycling facilities.

Major metropolitan areas within a couple hours of each other can have dramatically different policies. Austin Texas cautions that batteries should never be thrown in dumpsters or curbside trash. Houston Texas says it‚Äôs okay to put batteries in the trash. Some retailers like Home Depot say you may toss alkaline batteries in with ordinary trash.

Many places that call for putting AA batteries in the trash say it‚Äôs reasonable because they no longer contain mercury following a 1996 law. (Mercury was previously in batteries to help prevent corrosion.) The 1996 law also led to the creation of Call 2 Recycle a non-profit organization originally created by battery manufacturers which offers consumers battery recycling options.

What to do with your batteries also isn‚Äôt necessarily clearer if you check with manufacturers. Duracell encourages customers to check with local and state regulations as well as check out recycling options.

Amazon sells AA batteries under its Basics line of goods that include a symbol of a receptacle with a large X over it that appears like it may be a trash bin or a recycling bin.

The crossed-out symbol means the product needs to be disposed of separately from household waste and typical recycling bins according to Amazon spokesperson Betsy Harden.

Harden added that Amazon recommends following EPA and local regulations."

Ground zero in the conflict is Wyoming a stronghold for golden eagles that soar on 7-foot (2-meter) wings and a favored location for wind farms. As wind turbines proliferate scientists say deaths from collisions could drive down golden eagle numbers considered stable at best.

Yet climate change looms as a potentially greater threat: Rising temperatures are projected to reduce golden eagle breeding ranges by more than 40% later this century according to a National Audubon Society analysis.

That leaves golden eagles doubly vulnerable ‚Äî to the shifting climate and to the wind energy promoted as a solution to that warming world.

""We have some of the best golden eagle populations in Wyoming but it doesn't mean the population is not at risk"" said Bryan Bedrosian conservation director at the Teton Raptor Center in Wilson Wyoming. ""As we increase wind development across the U.S. that risk is increasing.""

Turbine blades hundreds of feet long are among myriad threats to golden eagles which are routinely shot poisoned by lead hit by vehicles and electrocuted on power lines.

The tenuous position of golden eagles contrasts with the conservation success of their avian cousins bald eagles whose numbers have quadrupled since 2009. There are an estimated 346000 bald eagles in the U.S. versus about 40000 golden eagles which need much larger areas to survive and are more inclined to have trouble with humans.

Federal officials have tried to curb turbine deaths while avoiding any slowdown in the growth of wind power as an alternative to carbon-emitting fossil fuels ‚Äî a key piece of President Joe Biden's climate agenda.

In April a Florida-based power company pleaded guilty in federal court in Wyoming to criminal violations of wildlife protection laws after its wind turbines killed more than 100 golden eagles in eight states. It was the third conviction of a major wind company for killing eagles in a decade.

Despite the deaths scientists like Bedrosian say more turbines are needed to fight climate change. He and colleague Charles Preston are finding ways wind companies can reduce or offset eagle deaths such as building in areas less frequented by the birds improving habitat elsewhere or retrofitting power poles to make them less perilous when eagles land.

""It's robbing Peter to pay Paul but it's a start and I think it's the way to go"" Preston said. ""It's a societal question: Is there room for them and us? It's not just golden eagles. They are kind of a window into the bigger picture.""

Dangling from a rope 30 feet (9 meters) above the ground with a canvas bag slung around his neck Bedrosian shouldered his way into a golden eagle nest lodged in a cliff ledge in northwestern Wyoming. As an adult eagle circled in the distance the scientist made an awkward grab for the young eagle in the nest slid a leather hood over its head then wrestled the bird into the bag.

The 6-week-old bird was lowered and carefully extracted by Preston a zip tie around its feet as a precaution against talons more than an inch long.

""The key is not to forget later to cut the zip tie"" Bedrosian said.

The eaglet went on a scale ‚Äî about 7 pounds (3.2 kilograms). Bedrosian drew some blood from a wing to test for lead exposure and Preston clamped onto each leg a metal band with numbers for identification if the eagle's recaptured or found dead.

Golden eagles don't mate until about 5 years old and produce about one chick every two years so adult eagle deaths have outsized impacts on the population Bedrosian said.

Illegal shootings are the biggest cause of death killing about 700 golden eagles annually according to federal estimates. More than 600 die annually in collisions with cars wind turbines and power lines; about 500 annually are electrocuted and more than 400 are poisoned.

""Wind mortality wasn't a thing for golden eagles 10 years ago"" Bedrosian said. ""I don't want to pick on wind as the only thing. ... But it's the additive nature of all these things and several are increasing. Vehicle strikes are increasing. Climate change is increasing. Wind is increasing.""

Federal officials won't divulge how many eagles are reported killed by wind farms saying it's sensitive law enforcement information. The recent criminal prosecution of a subsidiary of NextEra Energy one of the largest U.S. renewable energy providers offered a glimpse into the problem's scope.

The company pleaded guilty to three counts of violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and was ordered to pay more than $8 million in fines and restitution after killing at least 150 eagles ‚Äî including more than 100 goldens at wind farms in Wyoming California New Mexico North Dakota Colorado Michigan Arizona and Illinois.

Government officials said the mortality was likely higher because some turbines killed multiple eagles and carcasses are not always found.

Prosecutors said the company's failure to take steps to protect eagles or to obtain permits to kill the birds gave it an advantage over competitors that did take such steps ‚Äî even as NextEra and affiliates received hundreds of millions of dollars in federal tax credits for wind power.

The company remained defiant after the plea deal: NextEra President Rebecca Kujawa said bird collisions with turbines were unavoidable accidents that should not be criminalized.

Utilities Duke Energy and PacifiCorp previously pleaded guilty to similar charges in Wyoming. North Carolina-based Duke Energy was sentenced in 2013 to $1 million in fines and restitution and five years probation following deaths of 14 golden eagles and 149 other birds at two of the company's wind projects.

A year later Oregon-based PacifiCorp received $2.5 million in fines and five years probation after 38 golden eagle carcasses and 336 other protected birds were discovered at two of its sites.

The number of wind turbines nationwide more than doubled over the past decade to almost 72000 according to U.S. Geological Survey data with development overlapping prime golden eagle territory in states including Wyoming Montana California Washington and Oregon.

USGS scientists concluded in a recent study that if anticipated growth in wind energy by 2040 occurs increased turbine-caused deaths could cut golden eagle populations by almost half over 10 years.

However the fact that no population-wide declines have been seen in recent years suggests some uncertainty in the projections. said lead author Jay Diffendorfer.

Federal wildlife officials are pushing wind companies to enroll in a permitting program that allows them to kill eagles if the deaths are offset.

Companies with permits can pay utilities to retrofit power poles so lines are spaced far enough that eagles can't be easily electrocuted. Every 11 poles retrofitted typically means one eagle death avoided annually.

Nationwide 34 permits in place last year authorized companies to ""take"" 170 golden eagles ‚Äî meaning that many birds could be killed by turbines or lost through impacts on nests or habitat.

For each loss companies are responsible for ensuring at least one eagle death is avoided somewhere else. Using conservative estimates that overcount potential deaths could even mean a gain of eagles in the long run said Brian Millsap who heads the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's eagle program.

""This sounds crass but it's realistic. Eagles are going to be incidentally killed at wind farms"" he said. ""We've got to reduce other things that will allow wind energy development.""

Agency officials would not disclose which companies hold permits. An Associated Press public records review shows most are wind farms.

Federal officials collect golden eagle death data through an online reporting system used by government agencies companies scientists tribes and private groups.

Fish and Wildlife Service officials declined to release the data because they said it could be used in future law enforcement cases.

The nests where Bedrosian and Preston are doing population studies are about 60 miles (96 kilometers) from the nearest wind farm ‚Äî 114 turbines that PacifiCorp began operating about two years ago near the Wyoming-Montana border.

Personnel on site scan the skies with binoculars for eagles and can shut down turbines when the birds approach.

""We tend to see more golden eagles in prairie areas where you're going to have the best wind regimes"" said Travis Brown a biologist with PacifiCorp. ""It's almost like competition for the wind resource because the birds are using it for movement.""

Ten PacifiCorp wind farms have permits authorizing the incidental killing of eagles and an application is pending for two more the company said.

Company representatives declined to say how many eagles have died under its federal permits. They said PacifiCorp's been building a ""bank"" of retrofitted power poles to offset eagle deaths and also wants to try new approaches such as painting turbine blades to be more visible and easier to avoid.

""We're working as hard as we can to avoid and minimize (deaths) up front and then anything we can't we're mitigating on the back end"" Brown said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53Zm15bmV3czIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdHJhZmZpYy90cmFmZmljLWxpZ2h0cy1vdXQtaW4tbm9ydGgtZ3JlZW5zYm9yby1kdWUtdG8tcG93ZXItb3V0YWdlLzgzLWZiYWRiNDliLTA4ZDUtNDA2MC04MjZkLWQxYzVjZGY0MGM2ZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Traffic lights out from Cone Blvd. to N.

Duke Energy was called to fix the issue. They didn't say how long it would take to complete the repairs.

Drivers should use caution and treat all intersections like a four way stop as police are not there to direct traffic.

StarNews Correspondent

Generations of University of North Carolina Wilmington students were inspired by Eric G. Bolen and James F. Parnell two professors who were towering figures in UNCW's biology department.

Bolen wrote books and papers on wildlife ecology while Parnell literally wrote the guidebook to birds of the Carolinas as well as volumes on the state's mammals and freshwater fishes.

The two men are officially retired now (the academic term is ""professor emeritus"") yet both stay very busy. Witness their new book ""An Abundance of Curiosities: The Natural History of the North Carolina Coastal Plain."" It is a remarkable text.

Like Julius Caesar's Gaul North Carolina is divided into three parts: The mountains in the west and the rolling foothills or Piedmont in the middle. Beginning at the fall line ‚Äî where the rivers have their first waterfalls ‚Äî is the wide Coastal Plain where sedimentary rocks take over from the metamorphic and the land is gently flat sloping on to the ocean.

As the title suggests the region is filled with wonders. North of Cape Lookout the barrier islands flare far out into the Atlantic creating the Outer Banks and enclosing the huge shallow lagoons or sounds. Along with the legendary wild ponies the Banks provide a haven for seabirds and sea turtles.

Closer to Wilmington the Coastal Plain is the native home of the Venus' flytrap one of a whole garden of species of bug-eating plants. Lake Waccamaw is the largest of the ""Carolina bays"" the unique oblong ponds and bogs that all seem somehow aligned with each other. (Few scientists today accept the theory that the Carolina bays were formed by a massive meteor shower but no better explanations have been advanced.)

The mouth of the Cape Fear River forms a way station for migrating birds of all kinds especially seabirds and shorebirds.

""An Abundance of Curiosities"" offers a fine overview of all this illustrated with plenty of striking color photographs. Boles and Parnell write in prose that's readily accessible to the average reader making this book ideal for students and amatuer nature lovers.

One of their best chapters is a survey of the European and early American naturalists who first witnessed these wonders from John White (the artist on Sir Walter Raleigh's Roanoke Island expedition) to John Lawson to Mark Catesby (an important almost forgotten predecessor of Audubon's) to the Quaker plant-hunters John and William Bartram. (Native Americans of course lived in this area centuries before whites arrived.)

In the 1820s Alexander Wilson captured a wounded ivory-billed woodpecker near Scots Hill. He brought it to a hotel room but the giant woodpecker with a wingspan of nearly 3 feet quickly pecked a fist-sized hole in the plaster. The ivory-billed woodpecker is extinct now since humans cleared out its favorite habitat of dead decaying tree trunks. So is the green Carolina parakeet which once flitted through Lower Cape Fear pine forests. (Bolen and Parnell include a sidebar on this delightful little bird.)

In the early 1900s North Carolina State University botanist B.W. Wells first sighted ""the Great Savannah"" ‚Äî a massive natural flower garden full of insectivorous plants ‚Äî from the window of an Atlantic Coast Line passenger car near Wallace. The Great Savannah is gone now plowed up for agriculture in the 1970s and 1980s but a replica the B.W. Wells Savannah has been created from the rights-of-way for Duke Energy's massive power lines.

The Coastal Plain can be inspiring. Rachel Carson author of ""The Silent Spring"" essentially began her career as a naturalist with a trip to Beaufort N.C. in 1938.

Things are changing the authors note. Wood storkswhich normally nest far to the south have been moving into North Carolina swamplands since 2005. (The wood storks like to be near alligators which prey on the raccoons that prey on stork eggs.) Manatees are being spotted in Tar Heel waters more and more often..

Bolen and Parnell end their book with an impassioned appeal to save endangered species.

One major flaw in this volume is the lack of an index but the authors have added extensive bibliographies at the end of each chapter for those who want to learn more.

'AN ABUNDANCE OF CURIOSITIES:

The Natural History of the North Carolina Coastal Plain""

By Eric G. Bolen and James F. Parnell

In the 1960s engineers Hans Werner Aufrecht and Erhard Melcher received some terrible news. Daimler-Benz had decided to end all motorsport activities ‚Äî tough luck for a duo working in the engine development department where they‚Äôd been wrenching on a new racing engine for the 300 SE. Rather than kill the project the engineers took the power plant to Aufrecht‚Äôs basement in Gro√üaspach Germany and continued development after hours.

In 1965 the engine was ready to go racing. With racing driver Manfred Schiek behind the wheel they entered that year‚Äôs German Touring Car Championship. And the engine didn‚Äôt just race ‚Äî it won 10 times proving to Aufrecht and Melcher that they were onto something big. Aufrecht decided he was ready to branch out and enlisted Melcher to continue their racing pursuits as an independent brand. In 1967 AMG was born.

AMG which stands for Aufrecht Melcher and Gro√üaspach charged out of the gates with an ambitious first project. The engineers purchased a used Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3 and began to prepare it for entry in one of the toughest races of the time the 24 Hours of Spa. The crown jewel was the car‚Äôs engine punched out to 6.8 liters and delivering 428 horsepower. In 1971 sans the support of Mercedes-Benz their team of 12 took to the track with the very first AMG. Onlookers mocked it and rightfully so. The 300 SEL was a big heavy luxury sedan not a purebred racer. They dubbed it ‚ÄúRed Pig.‚Äù

The Red Pig didn‚Äôt take long to transform mockery into amazement. Despite starting fourth on the grid the land yacht turned speedboat led the race by the end of the first lap. It dominated all of its competitors winning first in class and second overall. According to Aufrecht they would‚Äôve won overall if the regulators hadn‚Äôt limited its fuel tank to a measly 120 liters. Nonetheless AMG had left a mark and throughout the 1970s business exploded. So much so that the tuning firm relocated to Affalterbach where it lives today.

Fast-forward to 1986 ‚Äî AMG unveiled its most significant road car dubbed the AMG Hammer on account of the 5.0-liter V8 that lived under its hood. This engine was unique because it featured new four-valve-per-cylinder technology which had been developed by Melcher two years prior. It was the first time anyone had used this configuration in a Mercedes-Benz and it boosted power tremendously.

By 1993 Mercedes-Benz wanted a piece of the performance pie. The carmaker signed a contract with the tuning firm allowing Mercedes-Benz to sell AMG- branded vehicles through its vast dealership network. The first was the Mercedes-Benz AMG C 36 released that year and marking the start of a fruitful partnership. Within four years Mercedes-Benz commissioned AMG to build the marque‚Äôs first race car ‚Äî from scratch; 128 days after AMG completed its initial sketch the Mercedes- Benz CLK GTR entered to race in the FIA GT Championship series.

At the turn of the century Mercedes-Benz acquired a controlling stake in AMG renaming it Mercedes-AMG GmbH. Following this move Mercedes-AMG furthered its development of significant components for road vehicles. This included bespoke engines transmissions and entire cars from the ground up. In 2005 Aufrecht then 67 sold his remaining shares giving Mercedes-Benz complete control over its performance subdivision.

Throughout the 2010s Mercedes-AMG ramped up its engineering might while producing more in-house vehicles than ever before starting with the SLS AMG. The performance carmaker now manufactures three in-house vehicles: the AMG GT SL Roadster and GT 4-Door Coup√©. The company‚Äôs most ambitious project yet ‚Äî the Mercedes-AMG One ‚Äî is currently underway.

From the back and forth banter between Jennifer and her cousin Bruce to the fighting between the two and the obvious deep admiration and respect they both have for each other it is clear that Bruce trusted Jennifer to curb her Hulk rage and hone her skills.

Recommended Videos

Throughout the episode Bruce attempts to train his cousin to control her powers and better dictate when they appear an ability which Jennifer naturally possessed but perfected. Although Jennifer comes to terms with her new powers by the end of the episode she‚Äôs initially reluctant to have them and incredibly annoyed.

Bruce says ‚ÄúListen I know you didn‚Äôt ask for this but whether you like it or not you‚Äôre now a superhero. And who‚Äôs gonna protect the world if it isn‚Äôt people like us?‚Äù To which Jennifer Walters says ‚ÄúAre you quoting a comic book right now?‚Äù Bruce basically says ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Fans of the MCU are wanting to know which comic book Bruce pulls this legendary quote from.

After researching different comics it does not appear that this is a direct quote from any specific comic book even though Bruce claims it to be. Regardless this still made viewers think of Ben Parker‚Äôs famous quote ‚ÄúWith great power comes great responsibility‚Äù as Peter Parker was having trouble coming to terms with his new powers even though his uncle was not aware of them. Hearing this helped mold and shape Peter into the hero that MCU fans have all come to know and love.

Jennifer is also having issues with accepting her new fate as She-Hulk when her cousin tells her this and it is in that time that Jennifer appears to accept her role and come to terms with the heroine that was thrust upon her. She works long and hard to train herself and her powers in the first episode and even though she and Bruce have their disagreements Jennifer proves to Bruce that she appreciates the wisdom that he shares with her. MCU fans can stream She-Hulk: Attorney at Law now on Disney Plus.

Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking again

Whether it‚Äôs to have a change of scenery from working from home have a quiet chat with a friend or maybe just watch the world go by there‚Äôs a brand new cafe in Long Eaton which is worth every penny you spend. Community reporter Keimae Blake swears by it‚Ä¶.

Long Eaton is a bit of a trip for me to make but I would make it a thousand times again if it means stopping off at the Avocado cafe. The cafe that promotes healthy living is immaculate and trendy inside with cool interior and amazing tasting food.

The cafe had its opening delayed because of the pandemic but since then it's made great progress and is earning rave reviews online. I decided to check it out and was relieved to find out it was definitely worth the wait. I didn't want to leave!

The cafe in Tamworth Road is filled with colour framed photos on the wall and intricate details that make the place look welcoming and appealing. With fun facts about avocados printed on the wall and bright yellow and grey chairs it certainly looks like the perfect place to enjoy lunch.

On arrival I was greeted by two lovely female workers and ordered a hot chocolate for ¬£3.50. I ditched my usual greasy English Breakfast that I would usually order at a cafe for a customised rice bowl which came up to ¬£7.60 and it was heavenly.

(Image: Nottingham Post)

I had rice (of course) halloumi and Saffron chicken with pineapple juice. My pineapple juice was nice and cold fresh the perfect drink for a humid day. My rice bowl was incredible with sweet chilli drizzled on top the loveliest grilled halloumi and well cooked Saffron chicken.

The rice bowls are served with a side of veg including onions sweetcorn potatoes and prices start at ¬£4 as do the salad bowls. For a long while I was the only person in the cafe and got talking to co-owner Yassaman Falahati whose service didn‚Äôt disappoint.

(Image: Nottingham Post)

As the cafe started to get busier people tried salad bowls the cafe‚Äôs banana bread and avocado sandwiches. It‚Äôs safe to say that this cafe that‚Äôs been open for less than a month is a real hidden gem but one that probably won't remain hidden for much longer.

EBAY,eBay,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb21tZXJjZWJ5dGVzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL3doYXQtaGFwcGVuZWQtdG8tZWJheXMtbG95YWx0eS1wcm9ncmFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Happened to eBay's Loyalty Program?,"eBay launched a new loyalty program one month after decimating its eBay Bucks program last year but what‚Äôs startling is how narrow it is: the eBay Top Star new program is available in only two categories according to its website.

eBay all but eliminated its longtime loyalty program for buyers called eBay Bucks in April 2021. A quick check of the eBay discussion board on Sunday showed buyers are still asking why they no longer receive eBay Buck rewards such as a longtime member who called the lack of Bucks for purchases ‚Äúvery frustrating.‚Äù

eBay‚Äôs new loyalty program is called Top Star which is by invitation only and is available only to top buyers of sneakers. As we wrote last year it got off to a bit of a rocky start by publicizing perks that were not available to everyone.

Those left out were not pleased but others such as this seller who posted a video to YouTube about his experience being in the Top Star program this month are pleased with their membership.

As a side note the letter eBay sent to the seller announcing his membership in eBay Top Star program was signed by Mark Flaa Director of Sneakers at eBay whose LinkedIn profile shows he‚Äôs no longer employed at eBay as of April 2022.

The eBay Top Star program calls itself ‚ÄúOur invite-only loyalty program for watches and sneakers.‚Äù The landing page describes three benefits of membership:

Seasonal Collections

Exclusive access to a curated collection of covetable sneakers.

Special Events

One-of-a-kind events featuring sneaker celebrities that you won‚Äôt want to miss. Plus a chance to chat with fellow enthusiasts.

Top Star service

Personalized support from a dedicated customer support team.

Unlike eBay Bucks a search for ‚ÄúTop Star‚Äù on eBay discussion boards and on social media had us wondering if the program was still active. However during this month‚Äôs eBay Seller Check-In an eBay executive referenced the program saying it was available to the highest spenders in sneakers and would be expanding to other categories.

Watches and sneakers are part of eBay‚Äôs ‚Äúfocus category‚Äù strategy. While eBay CEO Jamie Iannone referenced the strategy in his second-quarter post-earnings call with Wall Street analysts on August 3 he didn‚Äôt specifically mention the Top Star loyalty program.

The CEO did say that focus categories performed 9% better than rest of the marketplace ‚Äì but since GMV was down 18% as a whole does that mean focus categories simply did less poorly than the rest of the marketplace or did eBay see real growth in focus categories?

The number of eBay active buyers declined again in the second quarter ‚Äì would bringing back eBay Bucks benefits help bring back absent buyers?

Let us know if you‚Äôve encountered the Top Star program on eBay and if you believe the end of eBay Bucks‚Äô main benefit has had an impact on your sales.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9tb25leS8xOTUxNTg0Mi9lYmF5LWV4cGVydC1tYWtlLXRob3VzYW5kcy1leHRyYS1jYXNoLXNlbGxpbmcv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3VuLmNvLnVrL21vbmV5LzE5NTE1ODQyL2ViYXktZXhwZXJ0LW1ha2UtdGhvdXNhbmRzLWV4dHJhLWNhc2gtc2VsbGluZy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I‚Äôm an eBay expert ‚Äì how to make ¬£1106 by selling unwanted items from around the house...,"SALE AWAY I‚Äôm an eBay expert ‚Äì how to make ¬£1106 by selling unwanted items from around the house

SELLING unwanted items from around the house could easily make you more than ¬£1000 one eBay expert has revealed.

Clare Seal is behind Instagram account My Frugal Year where she has documented got her 88000 followers how she paid off a massive ¬£27000 in debt.

2 Clare Seal reveals her top tips for selling your stuff on eBay

Now she shares her top tips for reducing your outgoings including selling all your unwanted belongings on second hand sites such as eBbay.

She said: ""Putting in the effort to sell what you no longer use is a great way to make a bit of extra cash.

""Sometimes it can be the most surprising things too - I listed empty fancy soap bottles from Aesop and they sold for ¬£10!""

Millions of households are looking for easy ways to make some extra cash in the cost of living crisis.

It's a good way to cope with spiralling energy bills soaring petrol prices and rising costs at the supermarket.

And research by eBay found that the average person has more than ¬£1100 worth of unwanted stuff lying around the house.

Old tech is some of the most lucrative to sell on - an unused laptop could get you ¬£290 and a smartphone ¬£153.

If you're clearing out the kids' bedrooms keep an eye out. An old pushchair or pram could earn you ¬£40 and you could expect to pocket around ¬£11 from old baby books.

If you've ever tried a new hobby only to quickly give it up - at least try and make some money back. Musical instruments could earn you ¬£137 and DJ equipment could fetch ¬£68.

Elsewhere around the house eBay estimates that the average seller can make ¬£36 from clothes and shoes they no longer use ¬£22 from cookware and even ¬£40 from photo frames.

Be sure to check the fees before you list on any site - eBay lets you list up to 1000 items a month for free but will take a cut of the sale price.

Here are Clare's top tips for making the most of your eBay listing:

Use the best key words

Ebay can be a real treasure trove of the most unexpected items - but you need to use the best key words to give you goodies the best chance of being discovered.

When you search for an item on eBay the results are filtered based on the title that the seller has given to their listing.

That means stuffing your listing title with lots of searchable terms which describe your item is crucial if you want buyers to find you.

Clare said: ""Even for things that you don't think will be available second hand items that are niche or specific - it's always worth checking eBay.""

Buyers can set up a saved search to help them keep an eye out for any specific items they're waiting to come up for sale.

Often people find it's worth the wait because it's cheaper than buying through a traditional retailer.

Pick the right category

When you're creating a listing for sale on eBay you'll need to choose a category to put it in.

Selecting the most appropriate category means a higher chance of the right buyers discovering your listing.

So parents selling children's clothes - select ""children's fashion"" not just ""fashion"".

Clare said knowing that old items are going to buyer who will appreciate them can make it easier to sell things on that have nostalgic value.

Clare said; ""There are something things I have been sad to sell - definitely some of my children's clothes.

""We had a couple of lovely organic items that were in really good conditions and I was sad to them them go but happy that another baby would get to wear them.""

Pictures are important

Ebay shoppers want to see what they're buying so if you want to maximise your sale price you need to include some decent pictures.

Listings without photos attached can make people nervous - no matter how good the description is.

Clare said: ""I recommended hanging clothing if you're going to sell it rather than folding it or laying it on the floor.""

Clare suggests using good lighting and a plain background. Be honest about any scratches or wear and tear on an item too she added.

""Take photos from lots of different angles and include close-ups if there is any special detail.""

Be detailed with your description

Once a buyer is interested you need to win them over with a fabulous description.

Be clear about the condition of the product or you'll risk negative feedback.

If you're selling clothes describe the fit of the item or the feel of the material.

Clare said: ""One of my best sales was a gold dress from & Other Stories which I actually bought on eBay in the first place.

""It had a surge in popularity and was out of stock everywhere so when I resold it it go to about ¬£70.""

Timing can be important too Clare said: ""I've found that listing an auction to finish on a Sunday evening often results in lots of last-minute bidding activity.""

Be realistic on the price

Don't just pluck a number out of thin air when you're deciding on an asking price - do some research.

Search for similar items to see how much they've achieved - searching by ""completed listings"" will give you the sold price.

Clare said you should ask yourself: what would I pay for this item? But even then you might end up being pleasantly surprised on some listings.

Clare said: ""I've been surprised by how much some of my items have sold for.

""The biggest surprise was the box from my Dyson Air Wrap. I prefer to just put mine in a drawer so I popped the leather case on eBay and got ¬£30.""

Elsewhere on eBay one coin collector sold a Kew Gardens 50p for ¬£210.

And one seller revealed how he made ¬£1500 by reselling items from Poundland.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vaGFja2FkYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvY2xvdmVyLWNvbXB1dGVyLWEtbW9kZXJuLXo4MDAwLWNwLW0tbWFjaGluZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clover Computer: A Modern Z8000 CP/M Machine,"Seeing some old Zilog 16-bit chips on eBay recently [Scott Baker] was curious enough to snap them up and build himself a Z8000 computer. It started as a two-board solution then he added a display module. Instead of layering the boards vertically √† la a PC/104 stack [Scott] decided to build them flat. His first backplane was triangular but he opted for a square to accommodate one more expansion board in the future. The assembled contraption resembles a clover hence the name Clover Computer.

The Z8000 was Zilog‚Äôs first 16-bit microprocessor introduced in 1979. It was not hugely popular for a variety of reasons (the Z8000 Wikipedia article has some interesting details). The Z8000 was eclipsed in the marketplace by Intel‚Äôs 8088 and Motorola‚Äôs 32-bit 68000. One interesting point is that the Z8000 did not use microcode and as a result its transistor count was significantly less than its contemporaries. The Z8000 was used in some military applications and despite its limited commercial success it continued to be available from Zilog and licensed second sources up until 2012.

[Scott]‚Äôs design splits the system into a CPU board a memory and serial board and a display board. Along the way he learns 1980‚Äôs era tricks from the Olivetti M20 one of the few computer systems designed around the Z8000. He also manages to find a recent Z8000 implementation of CP/M by GitHub user [4sun5bu] which [Scott] forked and adapted to his project (see project repo here). He succeeds in getting everything working and ports a monitor Tiny Basic and Zork.

Check out his project write-up introductory link and see it in action in the video below the break. Did you ever use or encounter the Z8000?

Read our ethics policy

Article Hero Image

A former Apple Store employee who used the name ""Sam Sung"" has put an old business card and employee t-shirt up for auction in the name of charity.

The auction listed on eBay as an ""Apple Sam Sung business card"" consists of a framed employee T-shirt and lanyard along with a business card. While not normally notable the lot is unusual due to the name printed on the business card: ""Sam Sung.""

Now known as Sam Struan the employee was genuinely called Sam Sung during his time as a Specialist at the Buchanan Street store in Glasgow Scotland between 2010 and 2012. He later moved to Vancouver and worked at the Pacific Center Apple Store in 2012 reports iPhone in Canada before his business card gained some notoriety due to the close competition between Apple and its South Korean rival.

After leaving Apple's retail arm in 2013 the employee auctioned off the business card using the Sung surname raising over $2500 for Children's Wish BC & Yukon.

Since leaving Apple Struan now works as a career coach.

Earlier in 2022 a family member found another business card created during Struan's time at the Buchanan Street store which brought up the idea of a second charity auction.

Rather than just the business card Struan's lot has been dressed up considerably with the shirt lanyard and business card mounted in a frame and behind glass. Struan also signed the glass ""just for fun.""

Struan adds ""I hope this card goes to a fellow Apple enthusiast who also wants to contribute to a great cause.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vcmV0cm9kb2RvLmNvbS9iZXN0LTcwcy10b3lzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Best 70s Toys Of All Time,"Take a walk down memory lane as we check out the best 70s toys of all time!

As I was born in the 90s I spent most of my time playing with 90s toys.

I guess the stands to reason but it‚Äôs interesting to see how many of those toys were influenced by the toys of yesteryear.

And more importantly how many of these 70s toys were still in circulation when I was a kid and indeed as I write this in 2022.

While parents were kicking back to Led Zeppelin and T-Rex their kids were unboxing ‚Äòshiny smooth pets‚Äô and learning how to spell.

Hey it might not sound cool to any young readers scrolling through this article right now but we‚Äôre talking about toys that were in circulation over 50 years ago here!

Anyway instead of listening to me waffle on let‚Äôs kick off with the first item on our list and literally have some good old-fashioned fun shall we?

We‚Äôve got to kick off this list of the best 70s toys with the Speak & Spell the brightly coloured toy that taught users how to spell.

Speaking out hard-to-spell words users would input them using the keyboard on the front and then find out if they were right.

Hey we‚Äôre all for anything that makes learning fun!

With multiple spelling games the Speak & Spell was designed to keep kids of all ages happy.

The Retro Dodo team use them to edit all our articles too‚Ä¶ honest.

How many of you can remember the phrase ‚ÄòWeebles wobble they don‚Äôt fall down?‚Äô

These little wobbly figurines were one of the most iconic toys of the 70s balancing perfectly whenever knocked.

And to be honest everyone tried to knock them over. I mean that was the whole point right?

Like all good toys they came with cool accessories like the haunted Weeble house and the regular Weeble house for those scared of ghosts.

I remember having a Weeble garage that my Mum got me when I was a kid. That‚Äôs a blast from the past!

Next up on our list of the best 70s toys is the world‚Äôs first indoor ball the Nerf Ball!

Who would have thought that a polyurethane foam ball measuring just 4-inches would become one of the most popular toys of the 70s.

Even when thrown around indoors these balls don‚Äôt cause any damage. You could throw one at the TV or the the window and nothing would happen.

Ok if there‚Äôs a precariously placed ornament on the windowsill then you might knock it off. But at least it‚Äôs not going to knock out the dog or your granny if they get whacked by accident.

I wasn‚Äôt around in the 70s but the legend of the Pet Rock lives on even in 2022.

The first Pet Rock came to being in 1975. Essentially it was $4 for a stone that came in a nest in a box with holes.

That‚Äôs it‚Ä¶

Still for about a year people went crazy for this fad purchasing their pet rocks and reading the feeding pamphlet to figure out how to look after it.

About 1.5 million sold in total‚Ä¶ we really will buy anything won‚Äôt we?

Every Retro Dodo reader should know about Pong. This classic Atari game was the first video game to smash commercial success and still has a strong following of players today.

If you‚Äôve never heard of this before then it‚Äôs essentially a tennis game with two paddles one on either side of the screen

Move your paddle up and down to volley the ball back onto the other side of the screen. If you miss a volley the other player gets a point.

It‚Äôs as simple as they come but it‚Äôs one of the best 70s toys of all time and a real ‚Äòpostertoy‚Äô for the decade.

In a world of PS5 haptic feedback and the best Nintendo Switch games you wouldn‚Äôt think that this Mattel Electronic Football handheld could have ever been popular.

You could say that this handheld gaming device got people used to handheld gaming however. I guess it acted as a precursor for the Gameboy too.

Would we have the DMG without this little handheld? Who knows!

The aim of this game was super simple; move the running back around defenders and score a goal for points. Younger gamers will find it so frustrating but it‚Äôs a real piece of nostalgia for any 70‚Äôs gamers out there.

I‚Äôve never ever finished a Rubik‚Äôs Cube before. I‚Äôve owned plenty and tried so many times but this little plastic cube of hate has always defeated my dreams.

The Rubik‚Äôs cube was never supposed to be a toy. Initially it was meant as a way of explaining 3D geometry to people.

Still it ended up being released at a toy show which instantly brands it as a toy in my opinion.

Maybe it was bad marketing; who knows?

There are over 43 quintillion different ways to solve a Rubik‚Äôs Cube and I can‚Äôt find one without cheating.

Still with over 450 million units sold to date I would like to think that at least one of you out there could tell me how to solve one!

I can still remember the day that I first got my own Hungry Hungry Hippos game. I got mine back in the 90s but it the game‚Äôs journey began all the way back in the 70s.

Originally from Japan and then eventually sold worldwide under MB Hungry Hungry Hippos has been a staple game in households ever since.

The concept has always been the same; push the levers on the hippos backs to elongate their necks and catch little plastic balls in their mouths.

The person with the most balls at the end of the round wins and the fun begins again!

It‚Äôs odd how many of these best 70s toys I had back in the 90s. I suppose they proved so popular that they were still in circulation when I was a little lad.

And Ants In The Pants is still being made by MB today!

I guess its because it‚Äôs such a simple game to play for all ages. Essentially it‚Äôs tiddlywinks with a big pair of plastic pants.

Players have to get their coloured ants into the pants before their opponents.

So simple yet so much fun!

Baby Alive takes the 10th spot in our best 70s toys list a doll that ate drank and wet itself.

Back in 1973 if kids wants to know what it was like to have a baby then Baby Alive was the closest thing to holding a real one.

They ate packets of food that owners mixed up with water and the baby would take it in one end and churn it out of the other.

By the time the 80s and the best 80s toys rolled around Hasbro were selling over a million of these dolls a year!

ECL,Ecolab,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1yb3VuZHVwLWRpZC13b3JsZHMtcmljaGVzdC0xNTQxMzE0OTIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire Roundup - How Did The World's Richest Spend Their Week?,"‚ÄúWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act but a habit.‚Äù - Will Durant

The mega-rich have built habits that have led them to be successful but there are plenty of memes and real-life in-depth stories that will tell you the opposite. You‚Äôll see stories discrediting Jeff Bezos‚Äô ‚Äúgarage startup‚Äù called Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) because he received $300000 from his parents or that Elon Musk was far from a self-starter because his father was a rich Engineer in South Africa.

Something we forget is that we are allowed to acknowledge both sides. Of course Bezos and Musk had a massive advantage given the position their parents put them in. Of course their upbringing was atypical privileged and not what you envision when you hear of stories about ‚Äòground-up self-starters etc‚Äô. However we can also applaud their ability to maintain and grow with the tools they were provided.

See just having money does not make success a forgone conclusion. How many lottery winners wind up broke? Various reports say 70%. Yet when we imagine hitting it big we all say we‚Äôd be ‚Äúset for life‚Äù.

The point is that long-term success can‚Äôt be luck or privilege. There are too many opportunities for stupid decisions that people like Musk and Bezos have to avoid on a daily basis to have their fortunes be made by accident. Sure it‚Äôs uncommon to find yourself at the same starting point that any billionaire on this list found themselves at in the beginning. But it‚Äôs absolutely within our control to learn from the discipline the business savvy and the ability to make smart long-term plays to manage your money assets and wealth. While each of these moves may not be perfect for any individual's set of circumstances it‚Äôs worth looking into the types of risks these billionaires find to be worth it.

With all that being said what were the world‚Äôs wealthiest getting into this week (8/12/22 - 8/19/22)?

Bill Gates is already Ecolab Inc‚Äôs (NYSE: ECL) largest shareholder. But this week according to Barrons the billionaire and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder doubled down on this investment purchasing even more. The move may resemble something you can use in your own portfolio. Ecolab is down nearly 27% YTD. Gates saw a stock he clearly believed in when he made his original investment. Despite the stock being down he likes and believes in the company and doubled down on his instinct. If you believe in the product just pretend that that stock is on sale.

One reason for the move in Ecolab may have to do with a story reported on Yahoo! Finance crediting Gates for saving Biden‚Äôs Climate Bill. Bloomberg Green reported that ‚ÄúOne of the world‚Äôs richest men felt he had to give one of the nation‚Äôs most powerful lawmakers a little pep talk...‚Äù The same article claims that Gates has sunk tens of millions into green cement startups like Ecocem CHEMent and Brimstone Energy.

Story continues

There was also the matter of nuclear fission startup TerraPower. TerraPower obviously not yet on market has raised well over $700 million to develop advanced nuclear reactors to serve as alternatives to the existing reactors that make up the vast majority of the world‚Äôs civilian nuclear fleet. Set to be in operation by 2028 and with a price tag of $4 Billion these are not moves to be taken lightly. You can read more about TerraPower at CanaryMedia. One interesting investing note on the matter is where the startup is getting its money from. Investments include over $250 million from a group in South Korea and previous funding being contributed by none other than..

Warren Buffett may be plotting for the future by backing Gates but in the present moment Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) just received approval on August 19 2022 to purchase up to 50% of oil giant Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY). The news of Buffett‚Äôs involvement alone helped the stock jump nearly 10% to close the day. Berkshire is already heavily invested in the company which has led to some speculation regarding Buffett‚Äôs willingness to buy the entire company. CNBC reported ‚ÄúHe will likely continue to buy as much as he can get below $70 or $75. If you own 30% or 40% and would like to buy it out at $95 or $100 you saved a lot of money‚Äù said Cole Smead president of Smead Capital Management and a Berkshire shareholder. ‚ÄúThis stock trades like a casino. The market is giving him all the stock he wants.‚Äù

Jeff Bezos made a ton of money betting on startups as well. In fact he likely made a fortune by investing in Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ: ABNB) nearly a decade before they went public. Bezos has an eye for up and comers in the Real Estate sector as he was one of several high-profile investors to participate in Arrived Homes‚Äô seed round in 2021. Arrived Homes is a real estate investment platform that allows retail investors to buy shares of single-family rental properties with as little as $100.

Bezos‚Äô Amazon was in the news this week as the company filed a legal complaint accusing the Federal Trade Commission of ""harassing"" current and former executives naturally including Bezos himself. The filing made on August 5 2022 hasn‚Äôt hurt the company as Amazon is up nearly 13% over the past month.

Elon Musk also stayed in the news per usual this week. There was the tweet about purchasing Manchester United PLC (NYSE: MANU) which was quickly clarified as a joke by Musk himself. He likely had to clarify since Man. U. is a publicly traded company. CNN discussed the potential for SEC action against Musk regarding the matter but it seems unlikely. However Musk needs to be careful as his tweets literally move markets. Manchester United jumped immediately following the tweet and is up $2.50 in the past month.

Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) seems to get Musk in hot water in more ways than one lately. Aside from trolling thanking Billie Eillish and general mockery there‚Äôs the whole matter of... acquiring the entire company. The purchase has been in the news for months but there was an interesting development this week. Musk‚Äôs team used Botometer to estimate that 33% of visible accounts on the platform were simply spam or fake. However Botometer creator and maintainer Kaicheng Yang said the figure ""doesn't mean anything"". BBC tackled the story in depth.

Finally Musk‚Äôs baby Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) made news for several reasons this week. On Friday Musk stated that Tesla is slowing down the rollout of its next ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving Beta‚Äù software update (10.69) due to ‚Äúmany major code changes.‚Äù Musk‚Äôs full tweet said: ‚ÄúThere are many major code changes so this will be an extra cautious rollout. Releasing on 8/20 to ~1000 Tesla owners then 10.69.1 next week to accommodate feedback & release to ~10k customers then 10.69.2 week after & release to rest of FSD Beta.‚Äù

The news comes during the same week that Indonesian President Joko Widodo urged Tesla to manufacture its cars and batteries in the country. The President and Musk talked previously about the mov and had met earlier this year. The Indonesian President envisions the country as a hub for all EVs not just batteries. Approaching rapidly is the meeting in November when the country will host a leaders summit for the Group of 20 major economies. It should be noted that Tesla isn‚Äôt the only EV company on Indonesia‚Äôs radar as they already have investments or planned investments from Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM) Mitsubishi Corp (OTCMKTS: MSBHF) and Hyundai Motor Company (OTCMKTS: HYMTF).

A couple of takeaways:

Invest in what you're passionate about. Despite what you may think about Gates or Musk or the backlash they receive it‚Äôs clear they spend time money and energy on the projects that matter most to them.

Double down on your investments and things that you believe in. And don‚Äôt be afraid to play both sides. If Warren Buffett can back nuclear fission while also taking steps toward acquiring an entire oil company you can invest in health-conscious Simply Good Foods Co (NASDAQ: SMPL) and sugar pusher Hershey Co (NYSE: HSY).

Take your time invest in what you believe only invest what you can afford to lose and develop positive habits by investing in yourself. Do these things and you‚Äôll be better for it.

Developed by Electronic Arts Origin is a digital distribution platform from where you can purchase video games and play them on your PC. The platform has a dedicated software client for PC from where you can download your favorite games. But many users have reported that the game downloads automatically stop on Origin. So if you are also having a hard time downloading your favorite video game continue with this troubleshooting guide to fix the problem.

Origin download keeps stopping and getting stuck

If Downloads keep stopping or pausing and won‚Äôt finish on Origin on Windows 11/10 PC then you can try the following suggestions:

Try Downloading the Game Again Provide Administrative Privileges to Origin Check Origin Server Status Change Origin Compatibility Mode Allow the Origin Client through Windows Firewall Uninstall the 3rd Party Antivirus Program Clear the Temp Folder Turn Off Origin Client Service Perform SFC Scan

Now let‚Äôs check out all these solutions in detail.

1] Try Downloading the Game Again

Before getting into the technical workarounds the very first thing that you should do is to try redownloading the game. It can be a temporary error which is continuously stopping the download. So delete the ongoing downloading process and redownload the game. If this solves the problem you are good to go. But in case the problem continues check out the below technical solutions.

2] Provide Administrative Privileges to Origin

Origin is one such application that requires administrative privileges to run without any issue. Although it will run even without administrative rights but you will always be prone to different issues. Therefore make sure you have granted all the administrative rights to origin. To do so follow the below steps.

Right-click on the Origin shortcut icon and choose the Properties option. Click on the Compatibility tab. In the following window checkmark the Run this program as an administrator option. Click on Apply > OK.

Launch the Origin client and try to download any game. Check if the problem is fixed or not.

3] Check Origin Server Status

Like any other application Origin servers can go down any time due to some technical difficulties. If that‚Äôs the case it‚Äôs no surprise you are having a hard time downloading games on Origin. The only good thing is that you are not only the one facing the problem. You can check the Origin server status by visiting any of the server statuses checking websites. Additionally you can visit Origin social sites like Twitter and check if there‚Äôs an ongoing issue with the platform.

Unfortunately if the servers are down you can‚Äôt do anything other than wait until the developers resolve the issue.

4] Change Origin Compatibility Mode

The next thing you can try to fix the downloading issue of Origin is to run the client in compatibility mode. However this process is only effective if you are encountering a problem with Windows 11. Here are the steps you need to follow.

To begin with close the Origin window and make sure it‚Äôs not even running in the background. Now right-click on the Origin shortcut and choose the Properties option. Click on the Compatibility tab. Checkmark the Run this program in compatibility mode for option. Click on the dropdown icon and choose Windows 8. Tap on Apply > OK.

Check if the downloading issue is fixed or not.

5] Allow the Origin Client through Windows Firewall

Windows Firewall is one of the most important features of Windows OS that helps the system stay protected from malicious files and activities. But at the same time if any application is restricted under Firewall settings it will provide different errors. So here‚Äôs how you can allow the Origin Client through Windows Firewall settings.

Click ‚ÄòStart‚Äô and type ‚ÄòFirewall‚Äô in the search field and then click ‚ÄúAllow an app or feature through Windows Firewall‚Äô from the search results. On the next screen click Change Settings On the list of programs that appears tick/check both ‚ÄòPrivate‚Äô and ‚ÄòPublic‚Äô options for the Origin Client.

Now restart the Origin client and check if the problem is fixed or not.

6] Uninstall the 3rd Party Antivirus Program

Many third-party antivirus programs can block the smooth functioning of different application including Origin. Although it‚Äôs not important to have a dedicated antivirus program on Windows 11 still if you have any it can be the main reason you are facing problems with the origin downloads. So disable the antivirus program while downloading games from Origin and check if the problem is fixed or not. If not try the next solution.

7] Clear the Temp Folder

Temporary files are created by both operating systems and different applications including Origin. You can delete such files in order to free up large space and solve different issues revolving around your system. So here are the steps you need to follow.

Press the Windows + I shortcut key to open the Settings menu. Navigate to System > Storage. Click on Temporary files. Checkmark all the boxes and tap the Remove files option.

Now launch Origin and check if the problem is fixed or not.

8] Turn Off Origin Client Service

The next solution you can try is to disable the Origin client via the service screen. To do so follow the below steps.

Press the Ctrl+ Shift + Esc shortcut key to open the Task Manager. Click on the Services tab. Locate Origin Client Service. Right-click on the option and choose Stop from the context menu.

That‚Äôs it. Launch the Origin client check if the problem continues.

9] Perform SFC Scan

Corrupted system files can also be the reason causing the mentioned issue. And the best way to get rid of such files is to perform an SFC scan. You can do so by following the below steps.

Open Command Prompt in administrator mode.

Type the below-mentioned command in the press the enter key.

sfc /scannow

The SFC utility will run for a while and if any corruption is found it will replace it on reboot.

Why do downloads keep stopping on Origin?

The main reason why Origin keeps pausing downloads is that you haven‚Äôt provided the administrator rights. Along with this corrupted windows files a huge amount of temp data windows firewall to third-party antivirus programs anything can trigger the issue. It‚Äôs very easy to troubleshoot these problems.

How do I fix download speed on Origin?

There are multiple ways to fix slow download speed on origin. You can perform a power cycle on your router run origin as an administrator restart Origin in R & D mode delete the Origin cache file and troubleshoot the system in clean boot to fix the problem. If none of these steps work you can reinstall Origin to fix the downloading speed issue.

The main one though was that its sudden resolution this week did not require a higher entity to settle their differences.

Anthem and Maine Medical Center said this week that the Portland hospital would remain in the insurer‚Äôs network for two more years through the end of 2024. The announcement came after the hospital made its impasse with the insurer public in April announcing that it would no longer be part of Anthem‚Äôs coverage network starting Jan. 1 2023.

While disputes between insurers and health care entities are not uncommon the majority are solved behind closed doors. When they do reach the public sphere it is usually because they involve a violation that catches regulators‚Äô attention.

For instance Anthem was hit with a $5 million fine from regulators after its list of health care providers was inaccurate in Georgia. In that same state a county judge had to require coverage to continue while a hospital there and Anthem battled over contract negotiations. A Virginia hospital accused Anthem of violating the state‚Äôs timely payment laws.

Also read:

Here Maine Medical Center said in April that Anthem owed it more than $70 million for services over the past three years. Anthem in turn said MaineHealth the hospital‚Äôs parent organization was overcharging for services. The stakes were high and political leaders including Gov. Janet Mills urged a swift resolution.

Whether the two entities resolved their differences is unknown. After announcing a new two-year agreement on Wednesday neither hospital nor the insurer released details. MaineHealth on Friday declined to respond to further questions about the deal and referred a reporter to a Wednesday press release announcing the agreement with Anthem.

The very public nature of MaineHealth and Anthem‚Äôs contract fight set it apart from the get-go as did the tactics. MaineHealth drew attention to other Anthem battles in April such as when an arbitrator in Indiana ruled against the insurer in a dispute with 11 hospitals there. It accused the insurer of misconstruing billing practices to the media.

‚ÄúIn its disputes across the country Anthem has used this complexity to make unsupported claims about overcharging‚Äù MaineHealth said in an April 20 news release.

Anthem hit back using its advocacy group to promote a petition asking MaineHealth to stop overcharging for services and accusing it of worrying customers unnecessarily.

Also read:

Colin Manning a spokesperson for Anthem said coming to a quick resolution was key once the dispute went public. He also pushed back against comparing the MaineHealth dispute to problems in other states saying the circumstances and regulations were different.

‚ÄúWhen this matter went public it was important that we were timely and transparent with our customers and members to ensure them we were working on their behalf to provide better outcomes and to protect health care affordability‚Äù he said.

The MaineHealth-Anthem dispute set the stage for other frustrated health care entities to go public: Fore River Urology in Portland an independent practice ended its contract with the insurer in August. Coastal Women‚Äôs Healthcare in Scarborough also threatened to terminate its contract with Anthem earlier this summer although the two entities have since reached an agreement.

Peter Hayes the CEO and president of the Healthcare Purchaser Alliance of Maine whose members include employers that buy health insurance said how the dispute played out in public will be a case study for health care transparency issues down the line. While either side could present their grievances he pointed to recent federal regulations that require transparency in health care costs and resources that show the pricing information of many hospitals.

Those requirements could not only help consumers make sense of their financial choices but shed light on how Anthem and MaineHealth‚Äôs agreement will affect customers in the end even if the agreement details are not readily available.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll become known‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn Maine nothing stays a secret long.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ÄúTwo reasons‚Äù says Anthony Johnson founder and CEO of the biotech start-up Kodikaz Therapeutic Solutions about the decision to launch his company at an incubator in Lower Manhattan. ‚ÄúWe knew we wanted to set up in New York City because of the burgeoning biotech scene and all of the infrastructure in place for biotech to be a success‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAlso we were the inaugural Golden Ticket winner.‚Äù

Manhattan biotech space by the numbers 12 Number of buildings 7.7% Space availability 1.4 million Total square footage of laboratory space 2.1 million Square feet of space planned $114 Average asking rent per square foot Note: Figures represent space built exclusively for laboratory use. Source: CBRE Research 2021.

That Golden Ticket was issued in 2020 by BioLabs at NYU Langone the incubator offering Kodikaz free rent for a year. The award was sponsored by the big drug firm Boehringer Ingelheim.

With technology from Emory University Kodikaz is working on a system for delivering cell and gene therapy with DNA fragments. Called Zip-Code the platform enables targeted delivery of a wider variety of payloads than can be achieved using viruses and other standard delivery methods the firm says.

Kodikaz‚Äîthe name derives from the Greek word kodikas meaning ‚Äúcode‚Äù‚Äîis part of a new wave of start-ups in New York City where the vision of establishing a Cambridge Massachusetts‚Äìlike biotech center with technology from local research institutions mobilized development efforts a dozen years ago.

Now with an expanding landscape of laboratory space the Big Apple is beginning to attract entrepreneurs from elsewhere. Some start-ups are choosing the city over the well-established hubs of Cambridge San Francisco and San Diego.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs come a long way‚Äù Johnson says expressing enthusiasm for recruitment prospects in the city as Kodikaz moves forward. ‚ÄúWe want to be part of something that is actually growing. New York mirrors the growth we see in our company.‚Äù

Johnson expects his staff of 9 to expand to 25 in the next year and a half. The search is underway for larger lab space in Manhattan where such space is developing rapidly.

From center to centers

Intra-Cellular Therapies a specialist in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders moved into the city‚Äôs center of biotech activity in 2014 when it began leasing lab space in the West Tower of the Alexandria Center for Life Science a two-tower campus that Alexandria Real Estate Equities had opened in 2010. Tenants in the East Tower which had been the first to open included Eli Lilly and Company Roche and a branch of Pfizer‚Äôs Centers for Therapeutic Innovation (CTI) through which the drug firm collaborates with academic researchers.

Several real estate development companies are repurposing buildings in Manhattan as laboratories and office space for life sciences companies. One is Taconic Partners which opened the Hudson Research Center in 2017. Taconic and its partner Silverstein Properties converted six floors in a Warner Bros. film editing and processing facility‚Äîcalled the Movie Lab building‚Äîon Manhattan‚Äôs West Side. Taconic has two other sites including one on the East Side under development with partners. The firm launched a life sciences subsidiary Elevate Research Properties earlier this year.

We want to be part of something that is actually growing. New York mirrors the growth we see in our company. Anthony Johnson CEO Kodikaz

Last year Deerfield Management repurposed an office building as life science research space called Cure not far from the Alexandria Center. Janus Property and J.P. Morgan Asset Management are working on a similar facility in Harlem.

And Alexandria plans to keep building. With its two towers totaling 728000 sq. ft. (67600 m2) at nearly full occupancy the firm plans to build a third 550000 sq. ft. tower.

Outside Manhattan the 500000 sq. ft. BioBAT in the Brooklyn Army Terminal is operated by New York‚Äôs Downstate Medical Center and ELabNYC an entrepreneurship mentoring program. It began leasing lab space to biotech firms in 2008. And three real estate developers including Alexandria are bringing a total of 650000 sq. ft. of lab space to Long Island City Queens.

‚ÄúThe dramatic increase in activity in the last 5 years is directly tied to investment that the city and state made since 2016‚Äù says Maria Gotsch CEO of the Partnership Fund for New York City a nonprofit that works with New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) and the Empire State Development agency.

Gotsch points to NYCEDC‚Äôs LifeSci NYC a $500 million initiative announced in 2016 that offers tax incentives to promote investment by real estate developers as well as R&D tax credits for start-ups. New York State followed with a $620 million life sciences incentive program in 2017. NYCEDC announced an additional $500 million investment last year.

Spotlight on start-ups

Incubators supporting start-ups appeared as early as the late 1990s when the Audubon Business and Technology Center hosted by Columbia University uptown in Washington Heights opened. In 2013 Sam Sia a Columbia biomedical engineer and Christine Kovich a financial services entrepreneur launched the Harlem Biospace biotechnology incubator. But the concept has accelerated in recent years.

JLabs operated by a division of Johnson & Johnson opened on one floor of the New York Genome Center in 2018 with the help of $17 million in state funding. BioLabs a Cambridge-based company opened BioLabs at NYU Langone the next year with $5 million from LifeSci NYC and backing from NYU Langone Health Bristol Myers Squibb and other corporations. Both are in Lower Manhattan‚Äôs Hudson Square neighborhood home to Google‚Äôs new complex.

Keeping pace Alexandria has also launched an incubator venture installing the first Alexandria LaunchLabs on half a floor of the center‚Äôs West Tower in 2017. Last year Alexandria opened a LaunchLabs in partnership with Columbia University on one floor of a building owned by the university‚Äôs medical school‚Äîspace once occupied by the Audubon incubator. LaunchLabs now has operations in all the major US biotech hubs.

Managers at the incubators are enthusiastic about the unique environment for biotech start-ups in New York. ‚ÄúYou have diversity here‚Äù says Melinda Richter founder and global head of JLabs at Johnson & Johnson Innovation. ‚ÄúIf we are going to tackle the disparities of health we need to think about all communities and all communities are represented here in New York.‚Äù

Then there‚Äôs the entrepreneurial spirit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like ‚ÄòWe are going to do whatever it takes to get it done.‚Äô Never say die‚Äù Richter says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs New York.‚Äù

Biotech presents unique challenges however. ‚ÄúIn tech you give a couple of guys a couple of computers a couple hundred thousand dollars and a couple of years later they have a project they can sell to Microsoft Google or Facebook for $200 million.‚Äù Richter says. ‚ÄúIn life science when you start a new company you need specialized infrastructure you need specialized capital equipment you need special permits and licenses.‚Äù

JLabs is designed to support start-ups in all these areas‚Äîbeginning with equipped lab space according to Richter. ‚ÄúWhen you get into JLabs you can start pipetting in 24 hours‚Äù she claims. The incubator also provides networking fundraising and technical support. Each client is assigned a mentor at Johnson & Johnson called a JPal.

Other incubators provide similar space and networking amenities. Clients typically make use of dedicated and shared labs and equipment residing for an average of 2 years before moving to larger space elsewhere‚Äîa move requiring success both in research and in obtaining additional financing.

‚ÄúWe have all the tools for foundational research‚Äù says Glennis Mehra director of BioLabs at NYU Langone which hosts two floors once occupied by ImClone Systems an early New York City biotech success story. ‚ÄúThe model has proven itself in the short time we‚Äôve been open‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe have graduated four companies very successfully.‚Äù All stayed in the city taking space in the Alexandria Center Deerfield‚Äôs Cure lab space and the Hudson Research Center Mehra says.

About half the companies at BioLabs are working in traditional therapeutic areas Mehra says. Others‚Äîlike C16 Biosciences a firm pioneering sustainable alternatives to palm oil that recently moved from BioLabs into the Hudson Research Center‚Äîare active in other areas of biotech.

Applicants to the incubator go through a rigorous selection process during which they are vetted by a panel of New York University and NYCEDC representatives as well as by corporate sponsors of BioLabs. ‚ÄúI like to believe we are curating for a particular type of founder and a particular type of scientific endeavor‚Äù says Mehra herself an entrepreneur in the health-care arena. ‚ÄúI like to see someone who can articulate their proposition and sell. If you can sell me on it you can sell anyone.‚Äù

Movers

Brian Thomas executive director of Alexandria LaunchLabs at Columbia University watched developments in New York City over the past decade at his first job in the city at Pfizer‚Äôs CTI at the Alexandria Center. He came to New York after working as a researcher at various biotech companies in Cambridge for 14 years.

‚ÄúI had been trying for many years to live in New York City and could never find a job‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was really for academics and I wasn‚Äôt ready to go back and get my PhD at the time.‚Äù But he recognized the potential of a program like CTI that supports academic investigators in New York‚Äîand he made the leap.

Thomas says he went in with his eyes wide open. ‚ÄúWhat I saw very quickly was how actively the city Alexandria and the institutions were working toward making New York City as much of a hub as they possibly could‚Äù he says.

Witnessing the growth of opportunity in the city since he arrived Thomas was enthusiastic about moving to LaunchLabs at Columbia. ‚ÄúOne of the reasons I took this job is that it made so much sense to put one of these launch labs right in the middle of one of the major academic institutions that creates companies.‚Äù Most of the 10 start-ups at the incubator spun out of Columbia.

But New York City is no Cambridge Thomas says. ‚ÄúNew York will not have a central Cambridge hub presence. We should think of Manhattan as many hubs. It took me a while to get my head around that. You have to decide which part of the city you want to live in and do research in.‚Äù

Others who have witnessed developments in New York City firsthand are the leaders of companies that grew up and stayed. Sharon Mates cofounder and CEO of Intra-Cellular which launched in 2002 has seen it all.

‚ÄúWe started the company in New York because we started it with technology from Paul Greengard‚Äôs lab at Rockefeller University‚Äù Mates says. Intra-Cellular focuses on nerve cell signaling pathways elucidated by Greengard who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000. But finding a home in the city wasn‚Äôt easy.

New York will not have a central Cambridge hub presence. We should think of Manhattan as many hubs. Brian Thomas executive director Alexandria LaunchLabs at Columbia University

‚ÄúFirst of all space was extremely difficult to get‚Äù Mates recalls. ‚ÄúThe Alexandria Center didn‚Äôt exist yet.‚Äù The fledgling company lucked into Columbia‚Äôs Audubon incubator; it sublet space and then was able to rent directly.

Intra-Cellular grew and was able to move in 2014 into the West Tower of the Alexandria Center where it now has 40000 sq. ft.

The company has also expanded out of town. Its first drug Caplyta was approved for schizophrenia in 2019 and bipolar disorder in 2021. ‚ÄúWe have a whole sales force now and they‚Äôre all over the place‚Äù Mates says. ‚ÄúBut the research is maintained at the Alexandria Center. It‚Äôs a great place for the research people to be and it does give us a chance to hire people coming from the academic institutions because they all want to stay in New York.‚Äù

Kallyope named after the Greek muse presiding over poetry song and the arts and sciences moved into the Alexandria Center when the company was formed in 2015. The firm employs technologies including gene sequencing neural imaging and cellular and molecular biology to study neural and hormonal signaling between the gut and the brain. Kallyope was founded by three Columbia scientists including Richard Axel a recipient of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

‚ÄúEarly on there was some discussion of having the company launched in the Bay Area or potentially in Boston‚Äù says Nancy Thornberry Kallyope‚Äôs founding CEO and current chair of R&D. ‚ÄúBut there was a decision to stay in New York in part because the founders were there and we envisioned that they would be intimately involved in helping to guide the science particularly in the early years.‚Äù

The Alexandria Center was one of very few options at the time and perhaps the only one with a vivarium which Kallyope required for in vivo biology. The company launched with 6 employees and has grown to about 100. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve taken additional space there on four occasions‚Äù Thornberry says. It now occupies half a floor in the West Tower.

Thornberry says Kallyope identified New York City‚Äôs untapped talent pool as another advantage of setting up there rather than in Boston or one of the California hubs.

‚ÄúThere is not a lot of competition for talent and there are so many remarkable research institutions in New York City as well as so many amazing scientists and clinicians in the New Jersey pharma corridor and other places that are relatively local‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe envisioned that it would be relatively easy to recruit and that has proven to be the case.‚Äù

Kallyope has managed to keep annual employee turnover below 3% she says far lower than the churn in the major life sciences hubs.

The next wave

Some of the more recent members of the New York City biotech community have diverged from the script of launching from local research institutions though they appreciate their proximity.

Credit: Black Diamond Therapeutics

Black Diamond Therapeutics graduated last year from BioLabs at NYU Langone to the Alexandria Center. The company whose cofounders met at OSI Pharmaceuticals launched with funding from New York‚Äìarea venture capital investors and with its own technology for discovering drugs targeting allosteric mutations that drive cancer.

Black Diamond which has a candidate in Phase 1 clinical trials for non-small-cell lung cancer and glioblastoma opened its business headquarters in Cambridge in order to mix with the Boston area‚Äôs community of experienced biotech entrepreneurs. But the firm has made a long-term commitment to research in New York City according to Elizabeth Buck a Black Diamond cofounder and its chief scientific officer.

‚ÄúNew York is a smaller community for biotech but if you look at the number of academic institutions with investigators who are starting companies who are eager to collaborate the environment certainly is as rich as in the Bay Area or in Boston‚Äù Buck says.

C16 Black Diamond‚Äôs classmate at BioLabs was conceived in Cambridge where its three cofounders met and began thinking about palm oil alternatives.

The ‚Äúaccidental entrepreneurs‚Äù came to New York with their own science looking for a biotech environment less narrowly focused on therapeutics than those in Boston or the Bay Area CEO Shara Ticku says. ‚ÄúWe looked at our options and New York City became very compelling. The city and state were actively trying to build an ecosystem there. It was a really exciting growth space.‚Äù

The New York City area is also home to many of the consumer product companies C16 targets as potential customers. Ticku loves being in New York she adds and finds that many talented scientists do as well.

And just entering the JLabs incubator Linus Biotechnology a start-up spun out of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is looking forward to growing in New York City. The company which specializes in exposome research is debuting with momentum having been granted a breakthrough designation by the US Food and Drug Administration for the first exposomic biomarker for detecting autism at birth.

Linus named after Linus Pauling and the Greek mythological figure associated with musical dynamics already has two deals with major drug companies according to founder and CEO Manish Arora a professor of environmental medicine at the Icahn School.

Arora committed to New York City largely because of the diversity of the population a key to his research and one that can‚Äôt be matched even in a city like Boston. ‚ÄúI have access to a 50000-patient biobank at Mount Sinai Hospital‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn East Harlem there are the poorest recent immigrants. I have patients who have just come from Africa. You walk 10 blocks there are some of the wealthiest postcodes.‚Äù

The environment mirrors Linus‚Äôs diversity says Arora who notes that its cofounders came to the city from India Ireland and Australia.

The bottom line for Linus is much the same as it is for Kodikaz the next block over in Hudson Square: the city‚Äôs generative vibe which is especially in evidence at its venture-creating academic institutions Arora says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL2luZGlhbmEtYWJvcnRpb24tZmlnaHQtaGl0cy1nZW4tY29uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | We wanted to play Bunny Kingdom.

EQR,Equity Residential,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8veW92ZW5pY2UuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjAvdGVuYW50cy1vZi1tYXJpbmEtZGVsLXJleS1hcGFydG1lbnRzLXN1ZS1sYW5kbG9yZC1vdmVyLWJhY2tncm91bmQtY2hlY2tzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tenants of Marina del Rey Apartments Sue Landlord Over Background Checks,"Complaint claims REIT conducts investigative reports without disclosures

By Dolores Quintana

Equity Residential faces another lawsuit this time it is a class action lawsuit alleging invasion of privacy filed in Los Angeles Superior Court that alleges that the trust company insisted on running consumer reports rather than just credit checks on their prospective renters that was filed on August 10.

California law dictates that any landlord that wants to run an investigative consumer report on a prospective renter must follow must disclose this information to the renter properly and inform them of the searches of their lives that are being conducted and give the renters access to the results of the search.

Equity Residential is part of Sam Zell‚Äôs Chicago-based company REIT which has faced many other legal woes.

The lawsuit states as quoted by The Real Deal that the company ‚Äúdid not want the tenants or prospective tenants to know about or have access to any confidential consumer reports about them but wanted to manage and run the property free of any restrictions questions or inquiries by tenants.‚Äù and alleges that Equity responsible for the management of thousands of rentals in the Southern California area deliberately commissioned and with intent hid these intrusive checks from their potential tenants.

None of the defendants are named in the suit which allegedly includes some employees of Equity Residential.

Prospective tenants who applied to two Equity managed and owned properties in Hollywood and Marina del Rey are the plaintiffs. Six of those plaintiffs applied to the Breakwater Apartments in MDR and two applied to Vantage Hollywood Apartments according to The Real Deal and the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that Equity Residential was ‚Äúwillful and grossly negligent‚Äù and asks for $10000 for each of the investigative consumer reports that were run on the prospective tenants punitive and other damages. The suit also requires that Equity change its policies regarding consumer reports to follow California law.

The suit alleges also that Equity Residential ordered investigative consumer reports on all of its prospective tenants and that the reports as quoted by The Real Deal ‚Äúoften contain errors or misinformation that is highly destructive of an individual‚Äôs reputation‚Äù which constituted a corporate invasion of privacy of the tenants who applied for apartments in the last two years. The applications did contain a release that would permit Equity ‚Äúto get private and personal information from third parties.‚Äù in violation of the law and would also screen prospective tenants for evictions and do background checks on them that often contained information like credit checks and that would access a prospective tenant‚Äôs employability.

The suit goes on to state as quoted by The Real Deal ‚ÄúWithout disclosure ‚Ä¶ [the prospective tenants] would not be able to read the reports and demand that errors be corrected and [the prospective tenants] would not even know if such reports were being used against him or her‚Äù

Another lawsuit pending against Equity Residental and their leasing practices is another class action lawsuit about the firm‚Äôs policies on late fees. A lawsuit from earlier this year alleged that Equity was chargings prospective tenants five times the rate for background checks and also made allegations about investigative consumer reports which stated that Equity Residential did not give prospective tenants the legally required access to the results of these reports.

In Washington D.C. Equity Residential was ordered by the court to pay almost $2 million in restitution in a lawsuit over illegal and deceptive rental price increases.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamVubmlmZXJjYXN0ZW5zb24vMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9leHBlcnQtc3RyYXRlZ2llcy10by1hZGFwdC10by1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24tbGFib3Itc2hvcnRhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Expert Strategies To Adapt To Construction Labor Shortage,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennifercastenson/2022/08/20/expert-strategies-to-adapt-to-construction-labor-shortage/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamVubmlmZXJjYXN0ZW5zb24vMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9leHBlcnQtc3RyYXRlZ2llcy10by1hZGFwdC10by1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24tbGFib3Itc2hvcnRhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Dorothy was a real estate speculator who bought and sold property in the Chicago area but according to her children she lacked the ruthless streak necessary to thrive in the cut-throat world of residential property. She couldn‚Äôt bring herself to evict non-paying tenants and also suffered from the illegal and discriminatory practice of redlining by mortgage brokers. As a consequence she often struggled to provide a stable home for her own family. Mellody recalls that they would frequently move house often living in one or two rooms of unfinished and unfurnished properties that her mother was trying to sell and forced to heat water for baths on the stove. These experiences motivated Mellody‚Äôs future endeavors instilling in her both a fear of financial insecurity and a determination to help herself - and others - avoid similar circumstances in future.

From a very early age Mellody Hobson was learning vital lessons about the importance of financial stability and throughout her stellar career she‚Äôs made time to share that knowledge with others doing what she can to help other families avoid the insecurity and anxiety that plagued her own childhood. She‚Äôs also become a trailblazer for black women in business and her message of ‚Äòcolor bravery‚Äô is a vital rallying cry that seeks to shake up the passive stale boardroom of corporate America.

‚Äç

That motivation ensured that she was a highly diligent and successful student and after graduating high school she went to Princeton. It was here that she first met John W. Rogers Jr. the CEO of Ariel Investments now one of the largest African-American owned money management companies in the US. Rogers immediately recognized Mellody‚Äôs potential later telling Vanity Fair: ‚ÄùWhen I saw Mellody I saw this bright brilliant person who could indeed achieve anything.‚Äù He immediately offered her an internship. Once she had graduated Hobson joined Ariel full time and quickly rose through the ranks. By the year 2000 she was president of the company responsible for a large portfolio of clients and managing several billion dollars worth of assets. Ariel also developed less orthodox responsibilities in other areas; one such enterprise was the Ariel Community Academy a public school founded in Chicago by Rogers and Hobson in 1993 which taught students financial literacy lessons alongside the usual curriculum; an unusual move for an investment firm but a typical one for Hobson with her commitment to public education.

‚Äç

Everybody loves Mellody

‚Äç

In the meantime Mellody was impressing everybody she met and she began to meet increasingly impressive people. Her list of public admirers reads like a Who‚Äôs Who of American corporate society; for example Facebook‚Äôs Sheryl Sandberg cites her as a tremendous influence saying of her ‚ÄúMy life was altered by meeting her and that‚Äôs not something I say lightly. She is such a big part of my path taken. I think she does that for everyone.‚Äù Another admirer is Jeffrey Katzenberg co-founder of DreamWorks who said ‚Äúshe has a grace and graciousness about her that is singular‚Äù and went on to appoint her as chairman of the DreamWorks board. The chairman and CEO of Starbucks Howard Schultz agrees ‚ÄúWhen I think of her I think of grace. She‚Äôs the most unique individual. I love Mellody Hobson.‚Äù Once again this regard landed her on the Starbucks board and she‚Äôs also served on the board of the Estee Lauder Companies and is a director at JPMorgan Chase. Other noted admirers include Arianna Huffington and Oprah Winfrey whose friendship with Hobson led to the creation of her Teavana Oprah Chai Tea brand with Starbucks in 2014. She was even described as ‚Äúthe least famous person at her own wedding‚Äù after marrying fellow True Superhero George Lucas in 2014.

‚Äç

‚Äç

Rubbing shoulders with the great and good of American high society did little to change Hobson though and she remained focused on her mission to help increase financial awareness and stability among working people. While her own career was taking off she found time to work as a financial journalist as a regular contributor to ABC‚Äôs Good Morning America and performing a similar role at CBS. She managed to make the most of her celebrity contacts when she created the one-hour special Unbroke for ABC in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis calling on luminaries such as Will Smith Samuel L. Jackson and Seth Green to lend Hollywood star power to what is certainly the most glamorous documentary ever made about personal finance.

‚Äç

Color Bravery

Throughout her stellar career Hobson has been seen as a trailblazer for diversity in boardrooms but progress in breaking down barriers for other black women has been slow; as of 2020 she was still the only black woman chair of a Standard and Poor 500 Company and there are just two black women CEOs of Fortune 500 firms. Hobson has joked that ‚Äúblack women have it easier in business because they know how to identify discrimination immediately‚Ä¶ White women aren‚Äôt told [about discrimination]. And then they get into the working world and they‚Äôre like ‚ÄòOh my god it‚Äôs not a fair fight.‚Äô And we‚Äôre like ‚ÄòWe knew that!‚Äô‚Äù

‚Äç

‚Äç

While Mellody would surely prefer not to be in a position where her race and gender were seen as noteworthy she does not shy away from her role as a leader on these issues and gives highly influential talks where she shares her own experiences of discrimination in the world of business; in one notable anecdote she describes how she organized a fundraising lunch for her friend Harold Ford Jr. in support of his bid to become a Senator. Hobson and Ford - also an African American - arrived at the New York hotel hosting the lunch and on checking in they were mistaken for waiters as part of the catering staff and asked where their uniforms were. Hobson uses this stark reminder of the everyday bias faced by black Americans to highlight the futility of corporate America passively describing itself as ‚Äúcolor blind‚Äù and instead calls for what she terms ‚Äúcolor bravery‚Äù an active and candid approach to identifying and discussing the problem of lack of diversity throughout society. Hobson herself is an ideal person to deliver this message not just because of her tremendous success as an investor business leader and journalist but because of her gift for communication; it is hard to imagine someone more active and candid than Mellody Hobson the perfect True Superhero to deliver a message on bravery.

China has been very important for Thailand in terms of both the tourism and export sectors.

The country has been Thailand's largest trading partner for nine consecutive years with bilateral trade volumes surging 33% year-on-year to US$131 billion in 2021.

Mr Danai says the company has recently refined branding strategies for cosmetic products in China.

Thailand and China have also enjoyed very strong trade relations and diverse forms of cooperation including bilateral trade agreements the Asean-China Free Trade Agreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

China is regarded as a lucrative market and many cosmetic brands across the world are revving up to tap into a vast business opportunity given the sheer number of consumers in the country.

For example the Mistine brand only entered the Chinese market in 2016. After just six years Mistine is the best-selling sunscreen and foundation brand on Tmall a popular Chinese e-commerce platform with claims that sales have outperformed the world's most famous cosmetic brands such as Estee Lauder Anessa Lancome and Yves Saint Laurent.

REBRANDING TO KEEP THE BUSINESS AFLOAT

In its bid to maintain sales in China amid the Covid-19 outbreaks Danai Derojanawong president of Better Way (Thailand) Co the operator of Mistine single-level direct sales in Thailand recently refined the company's branding strategies for cosmetic products.

Under the rebranding scheme applicable in both the domestic and Chinese markets the company has changed its product images pricing structure and product positioning.

The existing Mistine logo will be retained for products sold through direct sales channels while a new logo will be used for products sold via retail wholesale and online channels.

Such a branding strategy allows the company to communicate more clearly to each customer segment.

""The method of advertising has changed. In the past Mistine products were endorsed by Thai superstars. Now superstars no longer have the same influence over the new generation of customers' buying decisions. In our new communications we instead use people in each area to represent the beauty values'' Mr Danai said.

Moreover the company has renovated its Mistine stores in some locations with new images and product packaging made more minimal to appeal to the new generation of consumers.

""We now put more focus on international markets especially China and online channels after Thailand's overall direct sales business fell by 34% a year during the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic and the government's consumption stimulus measures have led Thai citizens to spend more via digital platforms'' Mr Danai said.

In fact Mistine has been frequently adapting and changing ever since it entered the China market. At the start of its Chinese entry in 2016 the company focused on make-up products such as eyeliner and mascara. With customer loyalty in make-up products declining the company later shifted to skin care products such as sunscreen and foundation. Currently 95% of Mistine sales in China come from digital platforms.

Besides Mistine's presence on major Chinese e-commerce platforms the brand has also ventured into offline channels through partnerships with retail brands including Watsons KKC and Sanfu spanning more than 6000 points of sale.

INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE BEEFED UP

Mistine has also recently partnered with Cathay Capital and Shanghai-based equity firm EverYi Capital to roll out a $31 million Series A round of financing in China aiming to raise funds to further develop and strengthen its R&D and supply-chain capabilities together with team building.

The plans also aim to further deepen its omnichannel operational capabilities incubate new brands and increase Mistine's sales in China to 9-10 billion baht this year from 2.4 billion baht in 2021.

""Mistine is very popular for China's sunscreen lovers because our products are produced in Thailand which has tropical weather. Our products appeal to younger Chinese customers who do not want to get tanned'' Mr Danai said. ""Thai cosmetic brands are second to none in the world. The Mistine sunscreen product was ranked top-selling on the Tmall platform in 2021 ahead of Shiseido's Anessa product and was also ranked top for foundation well ahead of major popular European brands'' Mr Danai said.

Mistine's brand recognition was also credited to the popularity of the Lost in Thailand movie leading to an avalanche of Chinese visitors.

""Tourists are some of our most important brand ambassadors because our products are normally taken back to their homeland as a souvenir"" said Mr Danai.

""But to sustain the business in China in the long run we have to continue investing in research and development and seek new Thai ingredients such as Thai herbs to add value to the products"" Mr Danai said adding that success relies on speedy changes and non-stop development.

Mistine's direct sales business was started in Thailand in 1988 by Amornthep Derojanawong Mr Danai's father in three shophouses with fewer than 10 staff. In its first year of operation the business recorded sales of 16-17 million baht.

Now the business has a presence in more than 20 countries including Cambodia Laos Myanmar the Philippines Indonesia and China. Its products are made in both Thailand and China in order to balance business risks.

According to Mr Danai there is also market potential in Russia for the Mistine brand. Because of the ongoing war in Ukraine Russian consumers have shunned US and European brands.

""We see Russia's potential because many Russians have visited Thailand over the past 5-6 years. Once the war situation eases we will come up with a clear direction for the Russian market. To become an international brand is Mistine's long-term mission'' Mr Danai said.",,,,,,,,,

Through her business Doggy Dog Treats By Jazzy the 12-year-old Strawberry resident sells her home-baked and human-grade dog treats which contain no chemical preservatives on Etsy at etsy.com/shop/DoggyDogTreatsByJazz and at markets throughout the Bay Area.

After getting a food dehydrator bag sealer and other items to kickstart her business for her 10th birthday she opened up shop a month later in March 2020. The seventh-grader at Mill Valley Middle School is proof that with a little help a great idea and passion your dreams can come true.

Q When did your love of baking begin?

A When my mom and I moved from Los Angeles we moved in with my grandparents. I would always bake with my grandma and that started at a really young age probably around 4. My grandma has an amazing pound cake recipe so that was one of the key things we would make and we still make it today. It‚Äôs definitely a family recipe. My mom has it now and I can‚Äôt wait for the day that I get it.

Q Is Buddy your 12-year-old Chihuahua mix dog a taste tester for the business?

A Yes he is. He loves the treats and whenever we bake them he is standing by the kitchen and whenever we are packing them up he is right under us.

Q What made you want to get into the dog treat business?

A The idea came to me when I was 9. I like dogs so much and also baking had a big part in it. It‚Äôs really fun it also has broadened my knowledge of what dogs can eat and can‚Äôt. That was definitely fun and interesting researching.

Q How do you come up with flavors?

A After I figured out the main things dog can eat I looked at other dog recipes and I modified a lot of them and I came up with a few on my own. From there we started testing them and got the recipes down.

Q Has it been nice to have this to do in the pandemic?

A It definitely was especially when we first opened the store I got a lot of orders. And it kept me busy for a long time and the business still keeps me busy. I have been working all summer and going to markets most weekends. I think if I told myself when I was 9 where I am now I would probably be shocked. When I was 9 I didn‚Äôt think I would be where I am today.

Q What do you love about this?

A One of the things I really enjoy is how young I am in doing it. I think that‚Äôs really cool. I like seeing the reviews that people leave or if they post something on their Instagram Story of their dogs happy about the treats that‚Äôs always really fun to see. Buddy was very picky when it came to store-bought treats and after I started my business and started making treats the fact that he likes them I was really happy with that. I felt like what I was doing was good.

Q Any favorite customer interactions that you‚Äôve had?

A At the markets one of my favorite things is when I am able to see people‚Äôs reactions to finding out it‚Äôs my business and them figuring out how young I am and being able to see the dogs and give them treats if their owners let me. That‚Äôs always fun.

Q What would you say to youth your age who want to start a business?

A I feel like you can never be too young. When you start so young it opens a lot more possibilities because people are going to gravitate to that. And I think also it opens up a lot more doors of possibilities because if you start younger there‚Äôs more time for you to grow.

Q What are your hopes for the future?

A I want to sell my treats in stores. I want to keep going until I am at least out of high school and I want to grow enough to hire some employees. I am excited to see where it goes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZXZlcnlnaXJsLmNvbS9wdW5jaC1uZWVkbGUtZW1icm9pZGVyeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Punch Needle Embroidery Is My Go-To Way To Chill Out,"I‚Äôll be honest it‚Äôs really hard for me to pull myself away from my phone once my workday is done. I‚Äôm the queen of vegging out on the couch watching TV and scrolling simultaneously until it‚Äôs time to go to bed. Although there‚Äôs nothing wrong with taking it easy at the end of the day scrolling on my phone does nothing to help me turn my mind off. But recently I discovered something else to do at the end of the day that gives me a sense of calm and doesn‚Äôt involve scrolling through Instagram and TikTok. I present to you: punch needle embroidery.

Earlier this year I found a punch needle kit while browsing the aisles of Target. The designs were cute and I thought it would be a fun craft to try on my upcoming beach trip. I wasn‚Äôt even exactly sure what punch needling was but I tossed it in my cart anyway. Growing up I spent summers making friendship bracelets and I figured this would be the same sort of vibe just for adults (or anyone 12 and older as the box suggested!). After that first punch needling project on the beach I was hooked pun intended.

What is punch needle embroidery?

Punch needling is a form of embroidery that starts with a piece of Monks cloth placed in a standard embroidery hoop or frame. You then use embroidery floss to punch through the fabric with a punch needle making a small tuft of floss similar to a rug. Punch needle projects make really pretty wall art or you can make things like pillow covers patches on fabric totes or denim jackets stuffed animals and even rugs. It‚Äôs the perfect activity if you‚Äôre looking for some sort of mindfulness that involves movement. The simple repetitive act of stitching helps me wind down for the day and calms my nervous system putting me in a relaxed mood almost instantly. Ahh.

Punch needling is super simple and it was a nice chill alternative to your typical beach read. Now I‚Äôm looking forward to starting new projects for the fall and winter! This seems like an ideal activity to do curled up in a blanket by the fire while either listening to music or watching a favorite show or movie. For my finished punch needle projects I‚Äôm currently brainstorming ways to include them in a gallery wall. And as the holidays inch closer I‚Äôm on the hunt for patterns I can gift to friends and family. In the meantime I‚Äôm so glad I found a new hobby that creates a little more calm in my life‚Äîand beautiful art for myself and others!

Want to try punch needle embroidery for yourself? Here‚Äôs what you need to get started:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9zdHVkZW50LW1ha2VzLTEwMDAwMC1zZWxsaW5nLWZ1cmJ5LWNyZWF0aW9ucy1zdHJhaWdodC1vdXQtb2YteW91ci1uaWdodG1hcmVzLTE3MjE5MDA5L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9zdHVkZW50LW1ha2VzLTEwMDAwMC1zZWxsaW5nLWZ1cmJ5LWNyZWF0aW9ucy1zdHJhaWdodC1vdXQtb2YteW91ci1uaWdodG1hcmVzLTE3MjE5MDA5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Student makes $100000 selling Furby creations straight out of your nightmares,"Oh cool these are terrifying (Picture: Kennedy News/Sophie Stark)

Find Furbies scary? You might want to look away.

Because no matter how creepy you find those little furry owl things you‚Äôre going to find these even more unsettling.

Sophie Stark is a student artist whose specialty is creating nightmareish takes on the classic Furby toy.

Using a real Furby as a makeshift mould she creates creatures that look like they‚Äôre made of meat spaghetti hoops and baked beans.

The end result is‚Ä¶ horrifying.

But Sophie‚Äôs work which includes Skinby (a naked Furby with silicone breasts) Wormby (which looks like it‚Äôs made of worms) and Meatby (a meat Furby of course) has earned her more than $100000.

The 24-year-old‚Äôs Furby journey began when she was given a Furby and after some experimentation she began selling her works for $350-500 a pop.

Sophie Stark from Los Angeles California said: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd spend money on so when people said they would I thought they were joking.

‚ÄòI‚Äôve never sold work before so I‚Äôm baffled that such a strange idea is my first money maker.

‚ÄòIt was a happy accident. It started as just a hobby to keep me occupied.

Sophie creates all sorts of unsettling takes on the classic Furby such as this spaghetti hoop monster (Picture: Kennedy News/Sophie Stark)

This is skinby (Picture: Kennedy News/Sophie Stark)

‚ÄòThey are weird but that‚Äôs their appeal. People like to own a bit of culture that‚Äôs provocative and uncomfortable.

‚ÄòI know some people who have bought it because their friend hates it.

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs gross but it‚Äôs not totally unsettling. It‚Äôs about taking a toy and making it completely different.‚Äô

Sophie makes the bizarre products by creating a clay sculpture painting silicone over it then covering it with pieces of plaster bandage.

Sophie sells her works for up to $500 a pop (Picture: Kennedy News/Sophie Stark)

After it‚Äôs dried she removes the plaster and clay sculpture to reveal the work‚Äôs final mould which she fills with coloured silicone.

Three hours later the model is ready for her to paint. She adds some signature Furby-like eyes and tiny toy doll eyelashes to complete the look.

Sophie admits that she finds the original Furby a bit creepy so making her own out of gross items doesn‚Äôt feel sacrilegious.

Hello (Picture: Kennedy News/Sophie Stark)

‚ÄòI had a Furby as a kid and I was a little afraid of it‚Äô she explained. ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre strange because they feel a little too real and you buy into them too much.

‚ÄòI think I need to adjust my prices though because what I use to make them is so expensive so probably only half of what I‚Äôve earned has been profit.

‚ÄòI spend the rest making other artwork and paying for my studio so I don‚Äôt save as much as you‚Äôd think. All of the money goes back into the business.

‚ÄòI can‚Äôt say that I got rich making Furbies because I have no money. I don‚Äôt think any artist gets rich in the first two years of selling anyway.‚Äô

When you think of Walt Disney World Resort you may think of things like the monorail Cinderella Castle Mickey pretzels and fireworks. Disney World has four incredible theme parks ‚Äî Magic Kingdom EPCOT Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom ‚Äî each with its own unique feel. While a Park like the Magic Kingdom is always a popular choice one theme park has been gaining in popularity in recent years ‚Äî Disney‚Äôs Animal Kingdom Park. Some consider the Animal Kingdom a little out of the way but it offers experiences unlike any other.

The creative mind behind the creation of Animal Kingdom is none other than Disney Legend and Imagineer extraordinaire Joe Rohde. Rohde began his career with The Walt Disney Company in 1980 when he worked as a model designer and scenic painter at EPCOT‚Äôs Mexico Pavilion. Rohde worked his way up and became the lead designer of Animal Kingdom and the reason that Guests can ride one of the best roller coasters Expedition Everest ‚Äì Legend of the Forbidden Mountain.

If you have ridden Expedition Everest before then you know that the ride has you board a train at the Everest base camp. You ascend the mountain ready to explore the Himalayas ‚Äî home to the legendary Yeti ‚Äî when suddenly you encounter a torn-up track. You then shoot backward into the mountain after a brief pause you see the Yeti‚Äôs shadow and your train gets out of there as fast as possible. From there you drop down a fun steep hill and the excitement doesn‚Äôt end until you arrive safely back at base camp.

For many people the best part of the ride is when the train goes backward and pauses while you watch the Yeti. What you may not know is that the choice to pause the ride was apparently a controversial one. Rohde shared that little-known fact on Twitter when someone commented on how much they love the pause and how it makes the ride.

That pause in the middle was really controversial‚Ä¶ Even people on the team were like ‚Äúit‚Äôs a ride!!! we‚Äôre supposed to do something‚Äù But that moment is the pivot of the whole experience and I think folks need a sec to register the tonal change. Glad it works

That pause in the middle was really controversial‚Ä¶ Even people on the team were like ‚Äúit‚Äôs a ride!!! we‚Äôre supposed to do something‚Äù But that moment is the pivot of the whole experience and I think folks need a sec to register the tonal change. Glad it works https://t.co/61Qg60Flpy ‚Äî Joe Rohde (@Joe_Rohde) August 19 2022

Expedition Everest is not the only exciting ride that Rohde and his Imagineering team brought to Disney‚Äôs Animal Kingdom. If you are looking for a wild ride down a raging river then you can take a ride on Kali River Rapids. You can also take an incredible journey on the back of a banshee if you head over to Pandora ‚Äì The World of Avatar which was also created by Rohde and opened in 2017. If seeing animals like elephants and rhinos are more your speed then you can take a ride on Kilimanjaro Safaris.

What is your favorite experience to have during a day in Animal Kingdom?",,,,,,,,,,,,

Gail Finney remembered as champion for Wichita warrior for justice ‚Ä¢ Kansas Reflector,"TOPEKA ‚Äî Rep. Gail Finney‚Äôs colleagues mourned her death Saturday and remembered the Wichita Democrat as a fierce advocate for child welfare a warrior for justice a champion for her community and a shining example of a public servant.

Finney‚Äôs death was announced by fellow Democrats on social media. She was 63.

‚ÄúKansas lost a warrior today‚Äù said Gov. Laura Kelly. ‚ÄúNo one fought harder for her constituents for her community for justice and equity.‚Äù

House Minority Leader Tom Sawyer described Finney as ‚Äúa real fighter‚Äù noting that she continued to serve in the Legislature this past session while recovering from a kidney transplant. Sawyer who is also a Wichita Democrat said Finney‚Äôs ‚Äúlove for Wichita knew no bounds.‚Äù

‚ÄúFinney was a shining example of a public servant‚Äù Sawyer said. ‚ÄúHer ongoing work to ensure her community‚Äôs proper representation in Topeka reflected an admirable commitment to her neighbors and community.‚Äù

Finney had served in the House since 2009 and did not file for reelection this year. She was a member of committees that deal with criminal justice reform financial institutions rural development and insurance and pensions.

Finney fought for foster care reforms decriminalizing marijuana and improved accounting for maternal deaths.

‚ÄúMy heart is breaking‚Äù said Rep. Susan Concannon a Beloit Republican who serves as chairwoman of the Children and Seniors Committee. ‚ÄúRep. Finney was a fierce advocate for child welfare issues and a foster parent herself.‚Äù

Rep. Stephanie Clayton an Overland Park Democrat said Finney was ‚Äúwhip-smart funny and tough‚Äù and ‚Äúa shining example of constituent advocacy.‚Äù

Finney took on Evergy after the utility giant replaced wooden poles directly in front of her constituents‚Äô homes with massive metal ones some five feet wide and 105 feet tall. Finney‚Äôs public scrutiny of the ‚Äúbig ass poles‚Äù as she called them led Evergy to renegotiate with property owners and make other investments in Finney‚Äôs district.

Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes a Lenexa Democrat said Finney championed her community and stood up for those who were overlooked in the legislative process.

‚ÄúShe was a wonderful colleague to all a cherished friend to many and an incomparable advocate for our state‚Äù Sykes said.

Sen. Jeff Pittman a Leavenworth Democrat who served with Finney in the House for four years said Finney ‚Äúunderstood what it meant to persevere through adversity.‚Äù

‚ÄúI enjoyed working with her to make the world a more just place and will miss her‚Äù Pittman said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

To simplify this Angi shares tips and hacks on how best to utilize the space in your home.

STACKER.COM ‚Äî Finding time to clean and organize your home in between all the other tasks on your busy to-do list can feel like a challenge.

But tackling your overflowing closet might have more benefits than just a tidier bedroom: Studies have shown that clutter in your home can make it increasingly difficult to focus on tasks and others have demonstrated that organizing your home can help you manage your stress and give a better sense of control.

However this can be easier said than done‚Äîespecially knowing that Americans tend to hold on to their stuff rather than decluttering by paring down their belongings.

Fortunately there‚Äôs hope for us all thanks to organizing experts like Marie Kondo who offers a wealth of organization hacks on her Netflix TV show ‚ÄúTidying Up with Marie Kondo.‚Äù

Celebrities even joined in on the decluttering trend while quarantining amid the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some notable names included ‚ÄúReal Housewives of New Jersey‚Äù star Dolores Catania who overhauled her walk-in closet with help from designer Robin Laura and Jen Atkin a hairstylist to the stars who collaborated with pro organizer R√≠a Safford of R√≠Organize to revamp her kitchen.

Angi found insights shared online by realtors interior designers and home staging experts to find the smartest ways to increase or utilize storage in every room of your home. This list covers 10 rooms‚Äîfrom bedrooms to kitchens to garages‚Äîwith ways to expand and streamline storage in each one.

Bedroom

Between piles of laundry clothes shoes and blankets it‚Äôs easy to see how a bedroom can easily become cluttered.

So you probably won‚Äôt be surprised to know that the bedroom is one of the messiest rooms in most houses according to a 2020 survey by home decor company Joybird.

Luckily you can take a couple of simple steps to better organize your bedroom.

Start with the bed and take advantage of any space you have under it to stash items you don‚Äôt use often. You won't take up any additional floor space‚Äîand you'll keep items out of sight. C

reating designated spaces for every item can make a big difference as well like getting a jewelry box for your valuables keeping books and tissues on a nightstand and using door hooks to hang robes jackets coats and shoes.

Making your bed every day can also make your bedroom feel more organized and put together.

Bathroom

Not only can bathroom counters quickly become crowded with makeup hair products grooming kits and towels but these messes can also make this room pretty unhygienic.

Organizing your bathroom so you can easily find your belongings and clean effectively can make your morning routine much less hectic.

Consider using storage tools like baskets and ladder shelves to keep towels from piling up on the floor.

Place daily cosmetics and hair products in organizing bins on counters and stash the rest in drawers or cabinets. And if you find yourself frustrated by all the products cluttering your shower a shower caddy can be a simple all-in-one fix so you can worry less about knocking items over or tripping over bottles.

Kitchen

Between pots pans utensils dishes cutlery and food keeping your kitchen neat can feel like an almost impossible task especially if you have limited space. Don‚Äôt stress though‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone. The kitchen is another one of the messiest rooms in the house surpassed only by the living room.

Thankfully there are lots of creative approaches to finding extra storage in your kitchen like making the most of the space above your cabinets. Here you can store items that you might not use every day like special pans or cooking gadgets.

Organizing inside your kitchen cabinets can make a big difference too so consider cutting back on any items you have duplicates of (or stash them above the cabinets)‚Äîsuch as coffee mugs cups and water bottles‚Äîto make space for other important utensils.

Another useful tip: Free up counter space and drawers by going vertical. Add wall hooks over-the-door hooks for cabinets under-counter trays and stacking bins to store pans oven mitts and other kitchen tools.

Living room

The messiest room in the home is the living room and this may be because it's often the first space you enter after walking through the front door.

It‚Äôs easy for every family member to come home and set stuff down on a table or chair then immediately forget about it.

Investing in a coffee table with storage space can be a strategic way to help with clutter as you can store remotes papers and other odds and ends out of sight.

While they can take up a lot of space entertainment centers can also help you stay organized.

They typically offer large cabinets and drawers that you can designate for electronics books and other items that would otherwise clutter the room. Baskets or trunks add a decorative touch while also collecting blankets pillows and toys.

Canva

Dining room

It‚Äôs easy to start piling paperwork coats and bags on the dining room table especially if you don‚Äôt use it much. This is because dining rooms are typically close to the kitchen or living room some of the most heavily-used spaces in the home.

By incorporating hooks and baskets in this space you can create designated storage areas for your coats bags and all of your mail which can help keep your dining room clutter-free.

You may also want to consider decorating your dining room table with a centerpiece for example which could help make family members less tempted to pile unnecessary items there. Investing in cabinetry or hanging wall organizers with plenty of shelves and paper slots can also provide you extra storage space as well particularly for things like mail magazines and newspapers.

Basement

Often the basement is where little-used household items end up as people look for ways to make more room upstairs. This can lead to your basement quickly becoming the de facto home to a jumble of odds and ends.

As these items start collecting dust it's the perfect time to start going through those forgotten boxes to decide which items to keep throw away or donate. Add storage bins to organize the items you want to keep and stack them vertically to save floor space.

To keep your basement from getting cluttered again make sure to mark and label your storage containers so you can store similar items together and easily find items you might need down the road.

Attic

The attic like the basement is another area of the home that can easily go neglected and become overrun with items you don‚Äôt actually need.

After all out of sight out of mind right?

To start go through all of the boxes bins and piles of stuff you‚Äôre keeping up there and toss or donate the items you know will never see the light of day again. Then you can decide how you want to organize the items you still want to keep in your attic placing them in airtight storage bins to keep out dust.

Be sure to label the bins and consider getting storage shelving to organize the containers in one location.

Laundry room

The laundry room can quickly become a headache with piles of both clean and dirty laundry cleaning detergent dryer sheets and stray socks. This is also an area where many people tend to store cleaning products as well so it‚Äôs easy to see how disorganized the laundry room can become.

When rethinking your laundry room be sure to create a designated space for everything: Get colored laundry baskets to keep dirty laundry separate from clean clothes and keep them in separate areas of the room. Put up clotheslines where you can hang dry clothing that shouldn‚Äôt go in the dryer.

Staying on top of your laundry and not letting clothing sit in your laundry room for days at a time can also help with decluttering that space.

Canva

Garage

Between tools equipment and outdoor gear your garage can quickly turn into a dumping ground for random items.

Not only that but it can also be a dangerous area of your home if you leave tools or chemicals scattered on counters and floors.

To get ahead of this consider getting a garage storage system installed. While they can be pricey they may prove worth the effort as they provide an easy solution to decluttering your garage.

Another way you can better organize your garage space is to put up hooks and shelves on the walls where you can place tools and equipment so they are out of the way. Employing shelving and racks can also help create organizational space as can toolboxes for your workbench.

Hallway

Because hallways tend to be much smaller spaces than the rooms in your home they can quickly get cluttered when items are left there. For instance it‚Äôs not uncommon to find shoes coats and jackets sprawled around your hallway.

Even though there‚Äôs not a lot of space to work with here there are still ways you can organize the hallways in your home. For example try including a narrow table or credenza if it will fit or invest in adding wall cubbies or small shelves with hooks to stash items like bags and car keys that are easy to lose on the way in and out of the house.

Jim Schultz his newly minted Republican challenger has made an issue of the suit on the campaign trail. In an interview he described it as ""frivolous"" and said the Attorney General's Office should focus on violent crime by hiring more prosecutors in that area.

""It has zero chance at succeeding"" Schultz said of the fossil fuel lawsuit. ""It's fundamentally motivated by headlines and pleasing one side of the political aisle.""

Minnesota's isn't the only climate change lawsuit in the court system right now ‚Äî there are more than 20 from cities counties and states across the country. Very few have been dismissed.

""This lawsuit is in the long and successful tradition of Minnesota attorneys general standing up to protect Minnesotans from corporate fraud and deception by Big Tobacco Big Pharma and now Big Oil"" Ellison wrote in an e-mailed statement. ""This is what Minnesotans expect from their attorney general. It's the right fight to be having.""

The litigation argues that the American Petroleum Institute ExxonMobil and Koch Industries misled Minnesota consumers for years about the consequences of burning oil and gas. It argues that the state ""has already experienced billions of dollars of economic harm due to climate change"" and without action ""will continue to suffer billions of dollars of damage through midcentury.""

There is broad scientific agreement that burning fossil fuels has overheated the planet by belching carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere supercharging disasters like floods droughts and wildfires.

In the suit Minnesota asks for the defendants to publish any research they possess relating to climate change and to fund a public education campaign about climate change. It also asks for unspecified restitution and damages.

It's still not clear how judges and juries would view this legal maneuver to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable or if the questions will even get their day in court.

A wave of litigation

Minnesota's lawsuit and similar ones elsewhere hinge on the claim that fossil fuel companies duped consumers even as they knew that burning oil and gas would make the planet hotter said Korey Silverman-Roati a fellow with the Sabin Canter for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. Michael Burger the executive director of the center also works with Sher Edling the law firm handling Minnesota's case and others.

The cases are largely stuck on the same question: whether they should be heard in state or federal court. Almost all were originally filed in state court and the defendants have tried to move them to federal venues.

""This wave of litigation started in 2017 so we're coming up on the fifth year of these cases and we're still sort of mired in this"" Silverman-Roati said.

Oil companies and other defendants argue that as a national or international issue climate change should be heard in a federal courtroom.

But if they are heard there they face the hurdle of a 2011 Supreme Court case that makes it harder to claim fossil fuel emissions are a nuisance under federal common law. The case American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut determined that the Clean Air Act not lawsuits are the way to deal with some of these claims Silverman-Roati said.

So if the cases do stay in federal court and the court decides they're being pursued under common law they're in danger of being dismissed.

One case in New York that originated in federal court has since been dismissed. But in cases that were first filed at the state level federal courts and appeals courts have uniformly been sending them back there for consideration Silverman-Roati said.

Consumers and criminals

Minnesota's suit was filed in 2020. American Petroleum Institute is an industry group. One of the two oil companies sued Koch Industries runs the Pine Bend Oil Refinery in Rosemount though a subsidiary Flint Hills Resources which is also a named defendant.

The lawsuit cites internal corporate research particularly from ExxonMobil conducted as far back as the late 1950s that showed burning fossil fuels was increasing planet-warming gases in the atmosphere. It also includes examples of internal strategy documents from the late 1980s onward that call for injecting uncertainty into scientific discussions of global warming.

The litigation is in limbo at the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals as Minnesota argues it should be sent back to state court. Oral arguments were held in January. John Stiles a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office said in an email that an appeals decision isn't expected before this autumn at the soonest.

In an email an ExxonMobil spokesman wrote that the suit was ""a waste of millions of dollars of taxpayer money"" and doesn't reduce the risks of climate change. An API spokeswoman wrote that in the past two decades the industry ""has achieved its goal of providing affordable reliable American energy to U.S. consumers while substantially reducing emissions."" A spokesman for Flint Hills wrote that the firm strongly disputes ""any allegation that our company has ever been deceptive or dishonest with respect to the issue of the changing climate.""

Including Koch Industries sets Minnesota's suit apart from others across the country. Pine Bend produces about half of the gasoline sold in Minnesota according to research cited in the suit. It employs more than 1000 people according to the refinery's website.

Schultz argued the claims in the suit would fall apart. Asked whether the office should have a role in addressing climate change Schultz said ""The Attorney General's Office is not supposed to be engaging in far left political activism or activism of any kind.""

He added ""I will not engage in things like this that are fundamentally about business harassment.""

Ellison however argued in an e-mail that ""ExxonMobil Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute knew for decades their industries were a major source of climate change and were causing Minnesotans long-term harm.""

While speaking with the German magazine Tichy‚Äôs Einblick earlier this week the Hungarian prime minister who stands out among world leaders for his far-sightedness offered a prediction for the future that no other European leader has given saying that it is ‚Äúquite possible that this war will demonstratively bring Western superiority to an end.‚Äù

For Orb√°n when the conflict concludes the European Union will emerge weaker and less influential than it was before the war‚Äôs onset while other countries and regions who are presently benefiting from the war will find themselves in even stronger positions.

The Hungarian prime minister continued

Firstly the West cannot win the Ukraine war militarily; secondly the sanctions have in no way destabilized Russia; thirdly [the sanctions‚Äô] damage to Europe is immense; fourthly the world has not lined up behind the United States and Ukraine.

A large part of the world demonstratively has not backed the [West]: the Chinese the Indians the Brazilians South Africa the Arab world Africa.

While noting that the economic sanctions imposed by the EU against Russia had backfired and were causing immense damage to the bloc‚Äôs member states Orb√°n on the other hand highlighted the major beneficiaries of the war.

Those who have their own energy sources benefit. The Russians benefit. The European Union‚Äôs imports from Russia have decreased by a quarter but Gazprom‚Äôs revenues have doubled. The Chinese who used to be at the mercy of the Arabs have benefited. And of course the big American corporations are benefiting.

Six months into the Russo-Ukraine war ExxonMobil Chevron and ConocoPhillips‚Äîthree of the U.S.‚Äôs largest oil companies‚Äîsaw their profits double quadrable and increase sixfold respectively.

British Petroleum (BP) has seen its profits triple this year collecting 8.5 billion euros as prices have skyrocketed amid the war.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL2J1c2luZXNzL2RldmVsb3Blci11bnZlaWxzLXBsYW5zLWV2ZXJldHRzLW1hc3NpdmUtZnVlbC10YW5rLWZhcm0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Developer unveils plans for Everett‚Äôs massive fuel tank farm,"Davis essentially is approaching the project as two distinct sections: a residential area at the northern corner near Sweetser Circle where apartments and ground-floor retail would be built and an industrial area through the center of the property around Beacham Street to feature warehouses as well as high-tech and life sciences manufacturing. The company envisions up to 2.4 million square feet that could be built relatively quickly under existing zoning and another 2 million square feet or more that would evolve over time with the right market conditions and zoning changes. Davis has not yet disclosed plans for the property‚Äôs waterfront area.

During the past few weeks The Davis Companies has been sharing its preliminary plans for the ExxonMobil property. The Boston-based developer recently secured an agreement to buy the heavily contaminated site ‚Äî technically several connected parcels stretching from Sweetser Circle at the intersection of routes 99 and 16 down to the Mystic River waterfront.

One of Greater Boston‚Äôs biggest developments in years is taking shape just north of the Boston city line on a sprawling 95-acre fuel tank farm in Everett.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like we‚Äôre adding an adjacent city to the City of Everett‚Äù city councilor Stephanie Martins said in an interview. ‚ÄúWe need to really balance the existing and the new in a way that is sustainable.‚Äù

Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria is among those who hope the Davis redevelopment can be the impetus to finally extend the Silver Line rapid bus service into Everett and maybe even prompt a train station to be built there. Tracks for the MBTA‚Äôs Newburyport/Rockport line traverse Everett near the ExxonMobil property but there are no stops in the city.

‚ÄúOne of the most critical components of this project is the chance for us to attract new commercial businesses and job opportunities for our residents‚Äù DeMaria said of the Davis project. ‚ÄúI also think that the size and scale of this type of development will help force the state to move forward with using federal dollars available to it for the public transit improvements that I have been advocating for over the past several years.‚Äù

The potential redevelopment of the ExxonMobil tank farm comes at a pivotal point in the metamorphosis of the section of Everett around Lower Broadway transforming it from what was widely seen as home to a gritty industrial dumping ground on Boston‚Äôs doorstep to an entertainment destination with desirable housing and high-paying tech jobs. Wynn Resorts helped kick things off by opening its gleaming $2.6 billion casino and hotel in 2019 where a Monsanto chemical plant once stood overlooking the Mystic. Wynn also bought land across Broadway (Route 99) for redevelopment and is pursuing plans for a concert-and-conference venue for one of those properties to be connected to Wynn‚Äôs Encore Boston Harbor casino by an overhead footbridge.

Meanwhile Constellation Energy put a 40-plus-acre portion of its Mystic power plant property across from the casino on the market and hopes to wrap up that sale by the end of the year. Among the potential uses for that property that are being discussed: a stadium for the New England Revolution pro soccer team owned by the Kraft Group. Constellation plans to eventually shutter the two remaining gas-fired units at the power plant in two years.

The biggest of all of these is the ExxonMobil property which has been home to some form of petroleum storage and distribution since the 1920s.

Mike Cantalupa chief development officer for Davis told the city council that the developer will seek tax incentives or other public subsidies from city and state officials to help offset environmental remediation and infrastructure costs.

‚ÄúThe first and foremost issue on the site is to clean it up and it comes at a tremendous cost‚Äù Cantalupa said. ‚ÄúWe like to think we bring creative solutions to complex problems. ... We can‚Äôt be the sole provider but we need to solve them cooperatively and with the city‚Äôs input.‚Äù

Davis officials want to start with a 1 million-square-foot first phase with three buildings ‚Äî 300 to 350 apartments in one warehouse storage in a second and advanced manufacturing in the third. (Davis is currently developing a warehouse next door rumored to be for Amazon.)

The project features two distinct sections: a residential area and an industrial area through the center of the property around Beacham Street to feature warehouses as well as high-tech and life sciences manufacturing. Perkins&Will

At full buildout Davis sees the potential for more than 4 million square feet of development taking place including apartment towers and public green space ‚Äî as well as labs and biomanufacturing in part aimed at life sciences companies headquartered a short drive away in Cambridge.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt think this is your grandfather‚Äôs industrial park ‚Äî buildings with solid block walls and you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on inside the buildings‚Äù Cantalupa said. ‚ÄúThe buildings and the architecture need to be attractive.‚Äù

Reassuring city councilors‚Äô concerns about schools and traffic could pose another challenge.

Martins for example ticked off a list of potential issues with the development on her campaign Facebook page on Wednesday.

She said a solid commitment from state officials for a new train station is imperative as is a traffic mitigation plan to address the congestion along Route 99 and the Sullivan Square rotary in nearby Charlestown. She also wants to see a new fire and police substation built in the Lower Broadway area to accommodate all the new development.

‚ÄúAnything seems better than what we have. I must say the cleanup the remediation are huge positives‚Äù Martins said. ‚ÄúBut whatever we‚Äôre bringing to the city must be done right.‚Äù

Last Updated on Saturday 20 August 2022 1:13 by Denis Chabrol

Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo on Friday announced that bids for the estimated US$700 million gas-to-shore power plant and Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) would have to be manufactured by one of two Western companies.

He said bidders would have to propose using either Siemens or General Electric (GE) technologies but he gave no reason for government deciding to limit its preferences to those two. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve defined the technology we want to use which is Western technology- either Siemens or GE- Western technology. That has been defined so whoever the bidder is they‚Äôd have to use technology that we are comfortable with‚Äù he told a news conference.

According to Mr Jagdeo the nine prequalified companies now have to submit tenders for the power plant and the NGL facility during the first week of September.

The Guyana government‚Äôs announcement came weeks after signing a memorandum of understanding for a US$2 billion line of credit from the United States Export-Import (EXIM) Bank which would see American companies taking advantage of infrastructure opportunities in this emerging oil and gas economy.

Prior to the Summit of the Americas that was held earlier this year concerns had been raised by the US and EU that they had been losing influence in Latin America and the Caribbean to China. Guyana has in recent years been awarding multi-million dollar contracts to Chinese companies to build infrastructural projects.

The Guyana government expects the power plant which would be built at Wales West Bank Demerara to be completed by 2024 and the NGL plant by 2025.

ExxonMobil is paying for the construction of the estimated US$1 billion pipeline from cost oil and after its construction it would be insured to cater for leaks or ruptures. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know the total cost of the project‚Äù he said. Mr Jagdeo said the route for the pipeline was still being mapped and environmental studies conducted.

ExxonMobil is expected to supply 50 million cubic feet of natural gas via the pipeline which has the capacity of up to another 80 million cubic feet per day Mr Jagdeo said.

He restated that the cost of electricity would be reduced to 4 US cents per kilowatt hour down from 30 US cents and cooking gas would be produced free of cost.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuaW4vYnVzaW5lc3Mvb25nYy1pbmtzLWluaXRpYWwtcGFjdC13aXRoLWV4eG9ubW9iaWwtdG8tZXhwbG9yZS1kZWVwLXdhdGVyLWJsb2Nrc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ONGC inks initial pact with ExxonMobil to explore deep-water blocks,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.constructionweekonline.in/business/ongc-inks-initial-pact-with-exxonmobil-to-explore-deep-water-blocks on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuaW4vYnVzaW5lc3Mvb25nYy1pbmtzLWluaXRpYWwtcGFjdC13aXRoLWV4eG9ubW9iaWwtdG8tZXhwbG9yZS1kZWVwLXdhdGVyLWJsb2Nrc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Near the end of his performance the country music star cut the lights on stage and asked 13711 audience members how they might go about seeing him and his band.

""Iowa this is proof positive that what we cannot do alone we can sure as hell do together"" Urban said as lights from cellphones increasingly illuminated the night. ""Don't fall for the divide and conquer stuff guys. We are better together.""

After years of waiting thousands of Urban's fans got a little bit of everything from the country artist on Saturday night.

Urban had been announced as a performer at the 2021 Grandstand but had to cancel replaced by Dan + Shay. He'd also planned to perform at the 2020 State Fair which was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Urban has played central Iowa before including a performance at Des Moines' Wells Fargo Arena in late 2013.

Over the course of a night on stage filled with dazzling lights and adrenaline-fueled chords the Australian singer performed his hits including ""Wild Hearts"" ""John Cougar John Deere John 3:16"" and ""Somewhere In My Car.""

Ingrid Andress opened for Urban previewing many of the new songs from her upcoming album ""Good Person"" which comes out on Friday.

""I had a very large turkey leg today and I don't know if I'm ever gonna recover. It was delicious though"" Andress told the crowd after mentioning that this performance marked her first time at the State Fair. ""Guess I'll have to come back.""

Andress who previously came through central Iowa for 2021's Big Country Bash performed ""More Hearts Than Mine"" and ""Wishful Drinking"" a collaboration with Sam Hunt as well as ""Waste of Lime"" and ""Falling For You"" a song she said she'd never played for an audience before.

""We used to stay in Des Moines all the time because my dad was a strength coach for Major League Baseball so we would have to drive from Colorado"" Andress said.

""Des Moines holds a special place in my heart because that usually meant that we got KFC for dinner and got to swim in an indoor swimming pool. So it was a highlight of our road trips which tells you a lot about me honestly.""

Urban displayed one of the traditions of ""The Speed of Now World"" Tour at the State Fair.

""Every night when we get to track 10 we do a different song a random song"" Urban explained as a digital wheel spun to the song ""Say Something."" ""Because you all want to hear different things... we could be here for three days playing music.""

As the crowd roared approvingly at the prospect of 72 hours of Urban the musician joked ""OK I'll call home and tell them I'll be a little late.""

The concert ended with fireworks and after confetti showered the audience the stage lights stayed up as Urban and his band took bows.

Remo

It was a celebration of a strategic groundbreaking alliance that is poised to transform the future of Philippine real estate.

Top officials of real estate giants Federal Land Inc. and Nomura Real Estate Development Co. Ltd. (NRE) of Japan came together last week for the highly anticipated launch of their joint venture company Federal Land NRE Global Inc. (FNG).

FNG brings together the decades-worth of expertise of Federal Land which is celebrating its 50th year in the business and NRE to create landmark projects and masterplanned smart cities that will enhance and elevate residents‚Äô lifestyles. This skillful integration of Japanese innovation and Filipino sensibility will no doubt create new and real value in the local real estate market.

‚ÄòPerfect marriage‚Äô

Federal Land chairman Alfred Ty called this partnership with NRE as a perfect marriage of vision and values.

‚ÄúWe share a common long-term outlook anchored on creating world-class developments that enrich the way people live. It‚Äôs a true synergy wherein we raise each other‚Äôs performance whether in architecture technology construction management or most importantly to the quality of service rendered to our customers‚Äù Ty said.

‚ÄúFNG is here to make a difference in the Philippine real estate arena and more importantly in the lives of the communities we belong to‚Äîelevating living standards by introducing innovative design parameters from Japanese concepts and international best practices‚Äù Ty explained. ‚ÄúWe will introduce masterplanned communities in strategic locations innovative features sustainable solutions and cutting-edge technologies that fit today‚Äôs evolving and modernizing lifestyle. That‚Äôs the vision of FNG.‚Äù

An important market

NRE chair Eiji Kutsukake who flew in with his team for the occasion meanwhile pointed out that the Philippines is one of the most important markets for their company and as such they are looking to further expand their presence here over the long term.

NRE‚Äôs continued investments particularly in FNG indeed signals an unwavering vote of confidence on the local real estate market. To recall NRE‚Äôs collaboration with Federal Land started in 2017 along with Japan‚Äôs Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd. Through Sunshine Fort North Bonifacio Realty Development Corp. the companies are currently building The Seasons Residences an award winning multi-tower residential complex and the first MITSUKOSHI in the Philippines in Bonifacio Global City.

‚ÄúFNG is not just a special purpose company [that will be on a] project by project basis but a growing constant company for a long time business in the Philippines‚Äù Kutsukake said.

‚ÄúFNG with the spirit of equal partnership between FLI and NRE seeks to create new value that has never existed before by leveraging on each other‚Äôs strengths cooperating with each other and using various ideas and knowledge. We will combine our strengths‚Äîthe broad business infrastructure that the GT Capital group has the local real estate business experience and landbank that FLI has and the know-how and experience that NRE has contributed to Japan and overseas. We will create sustainable communities beyond generation in response to local needs and unique developments utilizing technologies that are new in the Philippines‚Äù he explained.

Traditional ceremonies

To mark FNG‚Äôs launch officials held the traditional Japanese ceremony Kagami Wari which literally translates to opening the lid. The round wooden lid of the barrel was broken open with wooden mallets by the top officials of Federal Land and NRE signifying the release of good fortune.

A Daruma doll was presented as well with Kutsukake drawing on one eye while the other was left blank. According to Japanese custom the eyes of the Daruma doll are initially blank. You fill in one eye after making a wish and the other eye only after the goal is completed. The drawing of the eyes signifies giving life and soul to the Daruma by opening its mind‚Äôs eye.

Officials likewise unveiled the FNG logo design which was inspired by the forearm handshake to symbolize peace. In ancient times the forearm handshake was a common gesture to show that both parties are not wearing weapons. Such is the depth of Federal Land and NRE‚Äôs partnership‚Äîit not only nurtures friendship but it also maintains a common pursuit.

Long term plan

These remarkable pronouncements are now creating buzz and excitement in the market. There‚Äôs a lot of expectations riding on FNG and how it can indeed elevate the game and transform the landscape‚Äîespecially after the officials unveiled plans over the next 25 years.

Federal Land president and COO Thomas Mirasol revealed that FNG will launch projects next year in Metro Manila Cavite and Cebu¬≠‚Äîwhich span a total of about 250 hectares.

The plan Mirasol said is to create smart mixed-use estates that will be home to multiple towers offering residences offices and commercial spaces.

Indeed one can only expect exceptional innovative offerings to come from such a game-changing partnership built on trust and shared values. FNG is without a doubt off to a great start.

As fast as it began the postseason will come to a screeching conclusion at the Tour Championship this week as the 30 best players from the PGA Tour battle for the season-long crown.

As he did for most of the regular season Scottie Scheffler will lead the pack into Atlanta. Bouncing back from his missed cut in the first playoff event the world No. 1 played himself into contention in Delaware and reclaimed the top spot in the FedEx Cup thanks to a top-five finish at the BMW Championship.

Due to the staggered start of the Tour Championship -- more on that in a moment -- Scheffler will begin with a two-stroke lead over Cantlay and a three-stroke edge over Zalatoris who withdrew from the BMW due to injury. Despite this advantage there are still premier players right in the thick of it thanks to their strong regular seasons. Those include multiple-time winners Cameron Smith Rory McIlroy and Max Homa all of whom will be within arm's reach at the onset of play at East Lake Golf Club.

With all of that in mind let's break down the FedEx Cup Playoffs format what we've already seen what to expect at the Tour Championship and which players to expect to make one final push at the finale for the $18 million first prize.

It was a dramatic ending at the top of the leaderboard at the BMW Championship and equally as intriguing for those names who battled their way inside the top 30 cutoff point for the Tour Championship. Players such as rookie Sahith Theegala Aaron Wise and Adam Scott all displayed guts and gumption down the stretch to secure their place at East Lake. Scott became the only player to successfully play his way inside the qualifying number in each of the first two playoff events as he entered the St. Jude Championship outside the top 70 and the BMW Championship outside the top 30.

These players will be granted a minimum payday of $500000 for their efforts as well as exemptions into the Masters U.S. Open and The Open in 2023. While they are positioned well in the big events for next season they will be starting behind the eight ball given the staggered start of the Tour Championship and the importance of playing well in the postseason specifically.

Players who have taken the most advantage of the first two playoff events include Sepp Straka and Scott Stallings who will begin the Tour Championship ahead of the likes of Homa Jordan Spieth and Joaquin Niemann thanks to their efforts over the last two weeks.

This emphasis on the postseason is especially true for someone like Zalatoris who was awarded zero FedEx Cup points at the BMW Championship due to his withdrawal yet still finds his name among the top three despite his early exit in Delaware thanks to his breakthrough victory at the St. Jude Championship.

Zalatoris and Cantlay sit pretty at the Tour Championship as they begin right behind Scheffler. In the first year of this format Patrick Reed won the first playoff event and started the Tour Championship in fourth. Justin Thomas won the second playoff event and started the Tour Championship in first. In the second year Dustin Johnson and Jon Rahm won the first two events and started first and second at the Tour Championship. The same thing happened in 2021 with Finau and Cantlay. There was a lot of movement to be had -- especially for the winners of the first two events -- but ultimately the right man begins the grand finale in the lead.

Tour Championship format

Heading into the Tour Championship inside the top five or top 10 in the FedEx Cup standings is important because of how scoring is dispersed. As he was at the end of the regular season Scheffler is first in the standings after the BMW Championship and will start the Tour Championship at 10 under with the event played under normal scoring conditions from there. Cantlay will start at 8 under and so on. With so much money at stake those margins become more meaningful than even a normal week. The eventual winners of the last three FedEx Cups have started first fifth and first at the Tour Championship.

1st: Scottie Scheffler (Starts Tour Championship at -10)

2nd: Patrick Cantlay (-8)

3rd: Will Zalatoris (-7)

4th: Xander Schauffele (-6)

5th: Sam Burns (-5)

6th-10th: Cameron Smith Rory McIlroy Tony Finau Sepp Straka Sungjae Im (-4)

11th-15th: Jon Rahm Scott Stallings Justin Thomas Cameron Young Matt Fitzpatrick (-3)

16th-20th: Max Homa Hideki Matsuyama Jordan Spieth Joaquin Niemann Viktor Hovland (-2)

26th-30th: K.H. Lee J.T. Poston Sahith Theegala Adam Scott Aaron Wise (E)

Tour Championship prize money

The numbers are startling. The winner of the Tour Championship gets $18 million. If you make it to the Tour Championship you're guaranteed $500000. Everyone who advanced to the BMW Championship is guaranteed at least $175000. Heck everyone who finished in the top 125 is guaranteed at least $120000. All of this is on top of what the first two tournaments themselves pay out. Add it all up and FedEx is giving out $75 million in bonus funds to the best players in the world.

1st: $18 million

2nd: $6.5 million

3rd: $5 million

4th: $4 million

5th: $3 million

6th: $2.5 million

7th: $2 million

8th: $1.5 million

9th: $1.25 million



10th $1 million



FedEx Cup standings

The top 10 going into the Tour Championship is fascinating. Cantlay looks to be a man on a mission after he endured a regular season that saw him unable to capture a solo victory. Scheffler has been the best player in the world since the spring and if his putter comes alive it will be difficult to upend given his two-stroke edge. Zalatoris is the ultimate wildcard as his status is unknown and this will be his first trip to East Lake as he did not participate in the FedEx Cup Playoffs a year ago.

Rank Golfer FedEx Cup points 1 Scottie Scheffler 4206 2 Patrick Cantlay 4129 3 Will Zalatoris 3680 4 Xander Schauffele 2825 5 Sam Burns 2605 6 Cameron Smith 2548 7 Rory McIlroy 2414 8 Tony Finau 2376 9 Sepp Straka 2224 10 Sungjae Im 2201

Cantlay was in pole position a year ago and should have a good understanding of what is going through Scheffler's head with a two-stroke lead. However Xander Schauffele is the guy who I believe will raise the FedEx Cup trophy. He broke through at East Lake for his first career victory back in 2017 and has since fallen in love with the place. He has finished no worse than T7 in Atlanta and is trending in a very nice direction after a T3 finish at the BMW Championship.

Scheffler and Cantlay's FedEx Cup chances will come down to their putters while Zalatoris' will come down to his driver. Much is made of his putting stroke but his inaccuracy off the tee combined with his questionable health status makes me believe Schauffele will be able to surpass him with ease over the course of four days and ultimately get the better of Scheffler and Cantlay as well.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMDQ2MDQ5LXJlcG9ydC1saXYtZ29sZi10by1hbm5vdW5jZS03LW5ldy1zaWduaW5ncy1hZnRlci1wZ2EtdG91cnMtZmVkZXgtY3VwLWNvbmNsdWRlc9IBiwFodHRwczovL3N5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmJsZWFjaGVycmVwb3J0LmNvbS9hbXAvMTAwNDYwNDktcmVwb3J0LWxpdi1nb2xmLXRvLWFubm91bmNlLTctbmV3LXNpZ25pbmdzLWFmdGVyLXBnYS10b3Vycy1mZWRleC1jdXAtY29uY2x1ZGVzLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Report: LIV Golf to Announce 7 New Signings After PGA Tour's FedEx Cup Concludes,"Rich Graessle/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images

LIV Golf will announce seven new additions after the conclusion of the FedEx Cup Tour Championship next weekend according to Alan Shipnuck of The Fire Pit Collective.

The signings include ""one long-rumored superstar"" while all seven competed in last week's FedEx St. Jude Championship which puts them inside the top 125 players in the FedEx Cup standings for the 2022 season.

Shipnuck reported all seven players will leave the PGA Tour on Aug. 29 and take part in the upcoming LIV Golf event in Boston on Sept. 2. This would prevent them from competing in the Presidents Cup a competition between United States and international golfers set to begin Sept. 19.

The superstar mentioned could be Cameron Smith who finished tied for 13th at the St. Jude Championship but withdrew from the BMW Championship because of hip discomfort.

According to Tom Morgan of The Telegraph Smith has already agreed to join LIV Golf after receiving a $100 million guaranteed contract from the Saudi Arabia-backed league. The British Open winner is currently No. 2 in the world ranking representing a major get for LIV Golf.

Others are potentially still competing for the FedEx Cup which holds a top prize of $18 million.

The top 70 in the current standings are competing at the BMW Championship through Sunday while the top 30 will advance to next week's Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta.

But there were too many players still on the course for him to celebrate.

‚ÄúIt would mean the world to make the Tour Championship and stand along 29 of the other best golfers in the world‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúA dream season‚Äù is how Theegala who a year ago was sweating out getting into the Korn Ferry Tour Finals when he boarded a plane for Boise not knowing whether he was in the field.

He entered Sunday sitting on the bubble and knowing what he had to do. That sort of pressure can do funny things to some golfers.

‚ÄúI was like I‚Äôm in 30th place out of 70 people and I‚Äôm as nervous as if I were near the lead‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI had a little bit of the shakes warming up. I couldn‚Äôt hold my hands still.‚Äù

Theegala made birdie at the first hole to settle the nerves temporarily but as he put it his round was ‚Äúa wild ride.‚Äù

He was one over for the day through 11 holes when strung together three straight birdies and then drained a 37-foot birdie at 17. Still he‚Äôd hit only 1 of 14 fairways all day dead last in the field and tried something different anything to find a fairway.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I tried to hit a draw. My natural shot is a cut. Tried to draw a 5-wood and it started 20 yards right of my target and then cut so I hit it 50 right‚Äù Theegala said.

He caught a good lie in order to slice one up near the green but left himself a 7-foot par putt that was worth at least $500000 ‚Äì last place money next week where the rich get richer.

‚ÄúThat was such a grind‚Äù he said after drilling the putt to shoot 3-under 68 and finish T-15.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs another step for me to feel like I really belong because I still don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm really there at the top of the game‚Äù he said.

Additionally to add to its environmental claims all of the company‚Äôs cars are built in Magna‚Äôs carbon-neutral factory in Graz Austria.

Founder Henrik Fisker is a mad genius designing a slew of iconic vehicles like the BMW Z8 Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage before starting his latest company Fisker Inc in 2016. The outspoken entrepreneur‚Äôs Midas touch is proving itself once again as his company has already sold out two trim levels of its Ocean SUV the Ocean Sport and Ocean Ultra. It also sold out 5000 units of its Fisker Ocean One edition.

Since the announcement of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 which changed the requirement for tax credit qualification to only include cars with final assembly in North America Fisker has been contacting interested parties in the US to mitigate any concerns about retaining the $7500 federal tax credit before the act potentially takes effect (Fisker‚Äôs vehicles no longer qualify for tax credits under the new law). Fisker told Ocean reservation holders that if they have a binding order and take delivery before the end of 2023 they still qualify for the tax credit.

The company made waves at the Consumer Electronics Show and the 2021 Los Angeles Auto Show where Henrik Fisker himself debuted the Ocean and its unusual features. Its available roof-mounted solar panels (called SolarSky) are touted to power 2000 miles of range per year. The center-mounted 17.1-inch touchscreen rotates vertically and horizontally like a personal tablet. And inside the cabin the Ocean employs all sustainable materials like recycled plastic bottles and other recycled plastics. Activate the Ocean‚Äôs ‚ÄúCalifornia mode‚Äù to lower all the windows (including the tailgate window) and slide back the sunroof for an open-air feel.

The Ocean the company‚Äôs base model is equipped with a single motor with 275 horsepower. Fisker says it will have 250 miles of range before needing to recharge. Stepping up a level there‚Äôs the Ultra which adds a second motor for a total output of 540 horsepower with a zero-to-60 mph time of 3.9 seconds. The Extreme and Ocean One models reduce that time to 3.6 seconds and sport 550 horsepower engines.

The Ocean SUV comes standard with what the company calls the Fisker Intelligent Pilot package which is its suite of driver-assistance technology. Included are programs for automated emergency braking blind-spot monitoring lane-keeping assist forward-collision warning and available adaptive cruise control.

With a starting price of under $40000 the electric-powered SUV is betting on the company founder‚Äôs vast experience and creativity to build and market its vehicles. Only 537 employees work for Fisker‚Äîan incredibly small number for an automaker.

One of the ways the company is staying nimble is through its ‚Äúasset light‚Äù approach which means it keeps its balance sheet healthier by farming out the manufacturing to Magna Steyr‚Äôs carbon-neutral factory in Austria. In a press release Fisker said it‚Äôs exploring ways to increase production of the Ocean to meet demand in the US by the end of 2023. No promises have been made yet however. With less than 100 days to go to production Fisker is focused on getting the first set of orders out the door.

‚ÄúOur asset-light rapid-product-development business model enables us to bring state-of-the-art technology like a revolving 17.1-inch center screen SolarSky sunroof and the world‚Äôs first digital radar to market earlier than other brands offering the latest technology for $68799 for our top-end fully loaded Fisker Ocean Extreme‚Äù Henrik Fisker tells PopSci.

Those who remember Fisker‚Äôs previous endeavor the luxury plug-in range-extended sports car Fisker Karma know that the CEO isn‚Äôt shy about stepping outside of what is considered ‚Äútypical.‚Äù Unfortunately plagued by the bankruptcy of its battery supplier A123 Systems Fisker‚Äôs design tooling and manufacturing facility were sold to Wanxiang Group in 2014. The Chinese company renamed Fisker Automotive to Karma Automotive and Henrik Fisker started over with Fisker Inc.

Fisker says it will resume production on November 17 and ramp up to 40000-50000 units in 2023. The company will reopen the order process for the Fisker Ocean Extreme trim on November 18.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL29pbGNpdHkubmV3cy9jb21tdW5pdHkvMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9waG90b3MtZml2ZS15ZWFycy10aGUtMjAxNy1zb2xhci1lY2xpcHNlLWZlc3RpdmFsLXB1dC1jYXNwZXItb24tdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1jZW50ZXItc3RhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,(PHOTOS) Five years: The 2017 Solar Eclipse Festival put Casper on the world's center stage,"CASPER Wyo. ‚Äî On Aug. 21 2017 a total solar eclipse made its way from coast to coast.

A partial solar eclipse was visible across the entire North American continent along with parts of South America Africa and Europe.

Since the totality path traveled mainly along rural sections of the country Casper was among the prime spots for eclipse tourists for a combination of its location and accommodations. It was the culmination of years of planning and preparation for the city.

More than 1 million visitors jammed into the Wyoming that week with Casper‚Äôs center of activity based mainly around the newly-completed David Street Station outdoor plaza.

Students look skyward in the lawn of their school in Lebanon on Aug. 21 2017.

Listen

Five years ago Middle Tennesseans were able to witness one of the most miraculous kinds of celestial events: a total solar eclipse.

I had spent the day with a first-grade class at Carroll-Oakland School in Lebanon where kids wore glow-in-the-dark T-shirts and had special lessons for eclipse day. They learned about the positions of the sun and the moon (and how they intersected at times) and had eclipse-themed activities.

It was all part of making the day both accessible and momentous teacher Tammy Boothe had told me: ‚ÄúI wanted to find the experiments that we could do easily with 6- and 7-year-olds ‚Ä¶ to where they would really have a meaningful day that they would remember for a long time.‚Äù

For Wyatt Erwin one of the most enthusiastic first-graders I talked to on that day it seemed to work. His memories of this otherwise random day in August are remarkably clear and abundant.

He remembers coming outside and seeing his parents sister and grandmother. He remembers that his sister was too little to know what was going on; she got distracted by her iPad. He remembers the glow-in-the-dark shirts and the repeated warnings about wearing protective sunglasses.

‚ÄúAnother thing I remember is after it happened everybody started freaking out because like this giant flock of buzzards or whatever they were came flying over‚Äù he told me during a Zoom call last week.

At one point in our call he even recited part of the story I produced that day back to me. ‚ÄúI actually do remember you pulling me out in the hallway and we sat at that little lunch table where we would put our lunch boxes on and then we did an interview there‚Äù he said.

At the time Boothe told me this might be the first world event her students would remember. I‚Äôve been thinking about this ever since. I love asking people about their earliest memory of a world event and the answers are often a jarring tragedy: Kennedy‚Äôs assassination the Challenger explosion 9/11. For this next generation it might be the pandemic.

But this event was so joyful. That seems really special for the kids in Wyatt‚Äôs class I told him.

‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs the thing‚Äù he mused. ‚ÄúFor every 10 bad events in the world there‚Äôs like one good one. And I‚Äôm guessing that was just one of the good ones.‚Äù

Wondering about solar eclipses? Another total eclipse will be visible in the U.S. on April 8 2024.

Voyager 2 is now 12.1 billion miles (19.5 billion kilometers) away and still sending back data on the distant and unknown heliopause and scientists are beginning to wonder how long the iconic space probe can keep going.

Designed to take advantage of a once-every-176-years alignment in the 1970s that made it possible for spacecraft to take gravity-assist slingshots from planet to planet across the solar system  the Voyager mission consisted of two probes. Voyager 2 was the first to launch with Voyager 1 following two weeks later. Both carried the famous "" Golden Record "" a 12-inch gold-plated copper disc containing sounds and images portraying the diversity of life and culture on Earth .

Now over 14.5 billion miles (23.3 billion km) away Voyager 1 is the farthest artificial object from Earth. But Voyager 2 is arguably more iconic because of its incredible multidecade tour of the giant planets.

Voyager's ""grand tour""

Though it launched second Voyager 1 was so called because it was to reach Jupiter and Saturn first ‚Äî in March 1979 and November 1980 respectively ‚Äî before exiting the plane of the planets where it took the famous ""Pale Blue Dot"" photo . Voyager 2 visited four planets: Jupiter in July 1979 Saturn in August 1981 Uranus in January 1986 and Neptune in August 1989.

""Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 provided tremendous legacies for planetary exploration"" Jonathan Lunine a planetary scientist and physicist at Cornell University who is working on the Juno  Europa Clipper and James Webb Space Telescope missions told Space.com. ""Not only in what they accomplished in terms of science but also demonstrating that it was really possible to explore the outer solar system with a couple of spacecraft.""

What did the Voyager probes reveal?

Voyager's discoveries are the stuff of legend among planetary scientists many of whom still rely on the unique images from the spacecraft's wide-angle and narrow-angle cameras. The probes spotted volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io  discovered that Jupiter's Great Red Spot is an Earth-size storm and found that the gas giant has faint rings. They studied Saturn's rings ; saw the giant moon Titan's thick Earth-like atmosphere; and revealed the tiny moon Enceladus to be geologically active.

Voyager 2 alone then visited Uranus and Neptune. The spacecraft's first-ever images of Uranus revealed dark rings the planet's tilted magnetic field and its geologically active moon Miranda. Neptune meanwhile was also discovered to have rings and many more moons than scientists initially thought. We also got to see Triton  a geologically active moon that is orbiting ""backward"" and like Pluto  is now believed to be a captured dwarf planet from the Kuiper Belt .

Voyager as a catalyst

In addition to making groundbreaking discoveries the Voyager mission helped scientists determine what merited deeper exploration. The mission revealed Jupiter to be an incredibly complex planet thus spurring NASA to launch the Galileo mission in 1989 and the Juno mission in 2011. The Voyager probes' work also helped to inspire the iconic Cassini mission to Saturn.

""Voyager 1's close flyby of Titan was the catalyst for the wonderful Cassini mission to Saturn and its Huygens probe"" Lunine said. The Huygens probe landed on the surface of Titan in 2005 and sent back an incredible video .

Voyager 2 has also been a catalyst for investigations into the role of the ice giant planets ‚Äî not only in the solar system but also in distant star systems since most of the exoplanets found so far are roughly the size of Neptune and Uranus.

Voyager and NASA today

NASA has spent decades following up on the Voyager missions and those efforts continue today. The space agency's Dragonfly mission will reach Titan Saturn's largest moon in 2034 while Europa Clipper will study Jupiter's ocean moon first imaged by Voyager starting in 2030. In April the National Academies Planetary Science Decadal Survey recommended that NASA send a $4.2 billion Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission to unveil the mysterious ice giant planet and its moons in the 2040s.

It's the latest mission that's a direct consequence of Voyager 2's brief visit to the Uranus system in January 1986. ""Voyager 2's flyby of Uranus was a bull's-eye ‚Äî it went directly through the plane of the moons' orbits because of the orientation of Uranus' axis to the sun "" Lunine said. That made it unlike flybys at other planets where the probes were able to visit one moon after another. ""Voyager 2 got very brief images from these moons so they're largely unexplored"" Lunine said.

Ariel and Miranda in particular are thought to be ocean worlds and so would be specifically targeted by the Uranus Orbiter and Probe. ""It's been 45 years since the launch of Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 and here we are now finally talking about a Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission"" Lunine said. ""It seems like a long time because these missions take so long to conceive of fund build launch and execute but it all comes from the intriguing peeks that we got from Voyager 2.""

How long will Voyager last?

Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 still communicate with NASA's Deep Space Network (which itself was created to communicate with Voyager 2 at Uranus and Neptune) receiving routine commands and occasionally transmitting data to Earth. ""We are still getting data from Voyager"" Stamatios Krimigis principal investigator for the Voyager 1 and 2 probes and the Voyager Interstellar Mission said during a news conference held at COSPAR 22 in July. ""We're looking forward to getting data for probably another five or six years.""

Around the mid- to late 2020s  the probes' scientific instruments will be entirely switched off and eventually the spacecraft will go cold and silent ‚Äî but their journeys into interstellar space will continue indefinitely. ""My motto is I want to be here after Voyager passes on"" said Krimigis who is in his 80s. ""But I'm not sure that's going to happen.""

In around 300 years Voyager 1 and 2 will enter the Oort cloud  the sphere of comets surrounding the solar system. About 30000 years later they'll exit the neighborhood and silently orbit the center of the Milky Way for millions of years.

Their scientific work may be almost over but the Voyager spacecraft have only just begun their journeys into the cosmos."

Spectators on their way to the Eagles @ Browns game in Cleveland saw a man selling orange shirts with a clear mysoginistc message relating to the Deshaun Watson scandal reading: ""Bitch give me a massage!"".

This is clearly meant to be a distasteful jest in relation to Watson's massage fetish that led to 24 women pressing charges for sexual assault.

It is common place to see rogue t-shirt sellers outside sports venues and also usual to see them have edgy slogans given that they are not officially licensed apparel. But this man's actions are clearly wrong. It is unknown whether shirt sales were a success for him that day but it is quite unlikely.

Congratulations are in order for Leah Messer who said ""Yes!"" when her boyfriend Jaylan Mobley popped the question!

The engagement comes one year after they started dating. She exclusively confirmed her romance with Jaylan to ET back in September 2021. Leah looked ecstatic on the day Mobley proposed to the Teen Mom 2 star. In photos obtained by People Messer can be seen covering her face after being completely surprised by the lovely proposal. The outlet reports that Jaylan popped the question Friday night during their anniversary trip to Costa Rica.

It seems Jaylan spared no expense when it came to the engagement ring. People reports he got down on bended knee with a whopping 4.7-carat custom ring.

""It feels amazing. I never imagined myself being here today but I couldn't imagine myself being anywhere else"" Leah said. Jaylan seemed speechless after Leah said yes.

""I can't even express how I'm feeling"" he told People. ""I wanted this moment to be the perfect moment for her.""

The proposal had been 2-3 months in the making Jaylan said telling the magazine he wanted to propose in the ""Pura Vida"" country after their visit soon after they started dating.

After the news broke Leah took to Instagram and posted the proposal photos and captioned it ""Two souls one heart ‚ù§Ô∏è It‚Äôs official!! üíç.""

Leah and Jaylan first started dating in August 2021. She confirmed the romance a month later.

""We met through a project Jaylan did with ESPN and the Army that was filmed and captured by one of my PA‚Äôs in September 2020"" Leah said at the time. ""In growing my network I followed Jaylan and in February of this year we connected through DMs and he asked me on a date.""

During that same interview Leah gushed about her man.

""He‚Äôs so compassionate caring patient kind thoughtful has a great sense of humor is adventurous and LOVES kids. I swore he wasn‚Äôt real!"" she said.

Their romance was followed closely by MTV cameras as Jaylan went to great lengths to live closer to Leah. They took a gigantic step just four months ago when he surprised her with a new home.

Leah's mother to Adalynn 9 with ex-husband Jeremy Calvert and 12-year-old twins Aliannah Hope and Aleeah Grace with ex-husband Corey Simms.

(AP) ‚Äî Ford Motor Co. plans to appeal a $1.7 billion verdict against the automaker after a pickup truck crash that claimed the lives of a Georgia couple a company representative said Sunday.

Jurors in Gwinnett County just northeast of Atlanta returned the verdict late last week in the yearslong civil case involving what the plaintiffs‚Äô lawyers called dangerously defective roofs on Ford pickup trucks lawyer James Butler Jr. said Sunday.

Melvin and Voncile Hill were killed in April 2014 in the rollover wreck of their 2002 Ford F-250. Their children Kim and Adam Hill were the plaintiffs in the wrongful death case.

‚ÄúWhile our sympathies go out to the Hill family we do not believe the verdict is supported by the evidence and we plan to appeal‚Äù Ford said in a statement to The Associated Press on Sunday.

Butler said he was stunned by evidence in the case.

‚ÄúI used to buy Ford trucks‚Äù Butler said on Sunday. ‚ÄúI thought nobody would sell a truck with a roof this weak. The damn thing is useless in a wreck. You might as well drive a convertible.‚Äù

In closing arguments lawyers hired by the company defended the actions of Ford and its engineers.

The Michigan-based automaker sought to defend the company against accusations ‚Äúthat Ford and its engineers acted willfully and wantonly with a conscious indifference for the safety of the people who ride in their cars when they made these decisions about roof strength‚Äù defense lawyer William Withrow Jr. said in his closing arguments according to a court transcript.

The allegation that Ford was irresponsible and willfully made decisions that put customers at risk is ‚Äúsimply not the case‚Äù another defense lawyer Paul Malek said in the same closing argument.

A Gwinnett County jury ruled in a favor of a lawsuit brought by the children of Voncile Hill 62 and her husband Melvin Hill 74 who were killed after a tire blew out on a local highway in 2014 and their 2002 Ford Super Duty F-250 pickup rolled over. The couple was farmers en route to pick up a tractor part the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Voncile Hill and her husband Melvin Hill were killed when their 2002 Ford Super Duty F-250 pickup flipped over from a blown tire in 2014.

Ford sold 5.2 million ‚ÄúSuper Duty‚Äù trucks with weak roofs that would crush people inside during rollovers the jury determined. The flaw was present in all ‚ÄúSuper Duty‚Äù models between 1999 and 2016 their lawyer James E. Butler said.

Attorneys showed evidence at the trial of nearly 80 similar wrecks where people had been killed or injured when the trucks‚Äô roofs crushed them during rollovers.

Ford has refused to say how many similar incidents it is aware of. Nor has the car giant ever issued a recall Butler said.

The suit also targeted Pep Boys for installing the wrong size tires on the truck causing the blowout.

The jury awarded more than $24 million to Kim and Adam Hill for their parents‚Äô wrongful deaths and pain and suffering. The jury determined 30% of the damages went against Pep Boys.

Businesses and governments spend billions upon billions each year to protect their assets from cyberattacks. And Statista expects that global market to increase from $183 billion to $539 billion by the end of the decade.

The industry isn't as fragmented as one might think. The top five cybersecurity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) according to The Motley Fool all have CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 2.02%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW -0.80%) as Top 10 holdings and three of the ETFs have both in their top five. And for a good reason as we'll discuss below.

We all know about ransomware and breaches which companies defend against daily but cyberattacks have also become a strategy for some nations. Cyberattacks increased in Ukraine as the Russian invasion began and Taiwan was hit with cyberattacks during U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's recent visit.

Much of our crucial infrastructure defense in the U.S. falls on the private sector. Increasing tensions make cybersecurity companies essential and therefore strong long-term investments.

CrowdStrike is leveraging growth

CrowdStrike is a force in the cybersecurity industry. Its cloud-based solutions powered by artificial intelligence attract major clients including over half of the Fortune 500 and 15 of the top 20 banks in the U.S. Its total customer base is exploding and the growth over the prior four fiscal years is shown below.

CrowdStrike added another 1620 customers in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and now has 17945.

What do we mean by leveraging this growth? CrowdStrike rapidly increases the amount its customers spend with it each period with a dollar-based net retention rate consistently over 120%. For example a customer might sign a contract for CrowdStrike services for one year at $50000. Then the following year it adds more modules and spends $60000.

CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue has increased from $71 million in the first quarter of 208 to over $1.9 billion as of the 2023 first quarter. The company is not yet generating profits on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) but posted $442 million in free cash flow last fiscal year.

CrowdStrike should be near the top of the list for growth-oriented investors.

Palo Alto Networks is an industry leader

Palo Alto Networks is an established leader with the most sales of any independent security company. It has tremendous reach offering network cloud zero-trust and endpoint security and other products and services.

Management is expected to release fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2022 earnings after market close on Monday Aug. 22. Investors should be optimistic since Palo Alto raised its full-year guidance last quarter. It now expects revenue to come in at $5.5 billion for the fiscal year representing a 29% increase year over year.

The earnings report could boost the stock given that the valuation lags behind established competitors like Fortinet as shown below.

Palo Alto posts impressive non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow but is not GAAP profitable due to stock-based compensation (SBC). Management has made it a goal to reduce its SBC as a percentage of revenue. This should be a positive for shareholders.

Both companies are taking advantage of ballooning spending on cyberdefense. The market can be volatile in the short term but long-term investors should do well owning a piece of these innovative companies.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""We have a number of what we call interventions"" said Joseph Schmidt climate project manager with The Nature Conservancy. ""We've got some breakwaters.

The 20-mile-long lagoon stretches from North Palm Beach to Ocean Ridge. Wildlife such as manatees green sea turtles and more than 100 species of birds call this estuary home.



And while this island is unique in its build the county built over 20 others over the last 20 years. Schmidt calls the county a pioneer.

Over the last century development and dredging dramatically altered the landscape replacing mangrove habitats and natural shorelines with seawalls and other human-made structures and they would become dead zones.

Companies are constantly buying each other.

With TV shows it‚Äôs even more confusing.

The rights to a show can get sold multiple times throughout its life.

This has left many people wondering who owns the TV show Family Guy.

Is Family Guy Owned By Disney?

Yes Family Guy is currently owned by Disney.

Disney acquired Family Guy on March 20 2019.

The company didn‚Äôt acquire Family Guy as a single show but rather as a part of a company acquisition.

Disney acquired 21st Century Fox which is the company that produces Family Guy along with many other similar shows.

By buying Fox Disney now owns all of the shows that Fox produced.

Owning Fox gives Disney all of these entertainment assets: -The Simpsons

-Family Guy

-X-Men

-Planet of the Apes

-Alien

-Predator

-The X-Files

-American Horror Story

-Ice Age

-Rio

-Home Alone

-The Sound of Music

-Miracle on 34th Street

-Titanic

-Avatar pic.twitter.com/cpTFGLGu3u ‚Äî Bloomberg Quicktake (@Quicktake) March 20 2019

While Disney did buy the Intellectual Property (IP) and overall rights they don‚Äôt own the Fox TV network.

However they do have the right to license non-local shows.

That includes Family Guy along with a host of other similar adult cartoons.

Family Guy is an adult animated TV show.

It premiered its first episode on January 31 1999.

Since the show premiered it has maintained a high level of popularity.

Over the course of the show‚Äôs lifetime it has been nominated for 12 primetime Emmy Awards.

Is Disney Going To Cancel Family Guy?

With Disney buying Fox there is concern from fans about their favorite shows being canceled.

Though Disney has the right to run 21st Century Fox in whatever way they like it doesn‚Äôt seem that Family Guy is at risk of getting canceled.

After all Disney bought the network because of its success.

It wouldn‚Äôt make sense to get rid of its most popular shows.

Is Family Guy Going To Leave Fox?

Some comments by Family Guy Creator Seth MacFarlane have left fans wondering whether the show is going to leave Fox entirely. MacFarlane tweeted:

‚ÄúTucker Carlson‚Äôs latest opinion piece once again makes me wish Family Guy was on any other network. Look Fox we both know this marriage isn‚Äôt working anymore. The sex is only once a year I don‚Äôt get along with your mother and well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been having an affair with NBC.‚Äù

Tucker Carlson‚Äôs latest opinion piece once again makes me wish Family Guy was on any other network. Look Fox we both know this marriage isn‚Äôt working anymore. The sex is only once a year I don‚Äôt get along with your mother and well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been having an affair with NBC. ‚Äî Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) August 1 2021

Many fans have suggested moving to another network owned by Disney.

While Disney has been renewed for a 21st season on Fox MacFarlane has shown signs of wanting to move away from the network entirely.

He has signed a contract with NBC to make content for them which is part of what he referenced in the tweet.

Why Is Disney Not Streaming Family Guy?

Despite the name Family Guy is not a very family-friendly show.

This is likely one of the big reasons Disney has not brought Family Guy onto the Disney+ platform.

Disney has set a limit on adult content on their platform.

For example the company made a decision that there would be no R-rated content on the platform.

Considering the kind of jokes Family Guy tends to make it‚Äôs hard to categorize the show as purely PG-13.

What Does Seth Macfarlane Think Of Disney Buying Family Guy?

Seth MacFarlane has expressed distaste for Fox and their support of controversial political pundits but what does he think of Disney buying out almost all of his shows?

Well he might be happier working with Disney than Fox but he‚Äôs still managed to make fun of the family-friendly corporation.

After the acquisition Family Guy aired an episode called ‚ÄúDisney‚Äôs The Reboot.‚Äù

This was a very ‚Äúmeta‚Äù episode where Family Guy basically talked about itself and the Disney acquisition.

In the episode Disney decides to refresh the Family Guy show by creating three different reboots.

The three reboot pilot episodes are then shown to focus groups which tear the episodes apart.

The episode isn‚Äôt very hard on Disney.

Perhaps part of this is because Family Guy wanted to test the waters and determine what they could get away with.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly Family Guy writer Alec Sulkin described the process of creating the Disney episode.

He said that there had been an increase in emails making sure that different parts of the episodes were cleared with higher-ups.

Overall though he indicated that the production of the show hadn‚Äôt changed much and the tone and content were set to continue uninterrupted.

Will Family Guy Get New Opportunities Because Of The Disney Acquisition?

While some fans might be nervous to learn about the acquisition because of how family-friendly Disney is others might see this as a potential opportunity for the show.

However it is unlikely that Disney is going to change Family Guy much even in terms of new opportunities.

Disney has a history of fiercely protecting the different brands they acquire and create.

This is part of the reason they aren‚Äôt putting every show they own onto the Disney+ platform.

Creating different streaming services for different types of content is a way to protect the brands of different shows and keep them separated.

Another reason the show will likely remain largely unchanged is that it is still being produced in the same studio.

Disney knows that the value of its acquisition lies in the fact these studios already do good work and they try to keep the changes minimal when possible.

However it might also result in some forms of limitation that Family Guy didn‚Äôt face before.

Richard Appel a Family Guy writer gave one example of this in an interview with E! Apple said that if the show asked for a Starwars crossover they would likely be told no.

He also points out that 10 years ago they were doing Star Wars episodes with the blessing of Lucasfilm.

Since Disney owns both brands now it is likely they will want to keep them separate.

Will Disney Change The Simpsons?

Unlike Family Guy or American Dad The Simpsons did make it on the Disney+ platform.

This might make fans wonder if the show will be censored by Disney to make it more family friendly.

Family Guy producer Michael Price gave an interview with CBR in which he confirmed that the show won‚Äôt be censored even after being placed on the more family-friendly platform of Disney+.

Is Family Guy On Netflix?

Family Guy is on Netflix.

You won‚Äôt find the entire show there though‚Äîonly the first eight seasons.

If you already have Netflix this means you can enjoy eight seasons of Family Guy without any additional cost.

Is Family Guy On Disney+?

Yes since Family Guy is owned by Disney it is on Disney+ in some countries!

Whether Disney+ includes Family Guy depends on the country you are in. In the U.K. Australia and Canada Disney + includes Family Guy.

If you do live in one of these countries you are in luck.

Unlike Netflix you are not just limited to the first eight seasons.

If you do not live in one of the countries that include Star content you will have to pay for the Disney+ bundle that includes Star if you want to watch Family Guy.

Does Hulu Have Family Guy?

Hulu does include the entire Family Guy series.

This is great news if you want to be able to watch the show from beginning to end.

Hulu also offers a free trial for 30 days.

If you wanted to watch the show for free you could simply sign up for the free trial and then cancel before the 30-day period was up!

If you do want to try to watch all of Family Guy for free in one month you might want to set aside some big chunks of time in your schedule.

To watch every episode of the show would take 165 hours.

That is 5.5 hours every day over a 30-day period! There are currently 389 episodes of Family Guy.

That means if you watch one episode a day it will take you over a year to complete the entire series!

Is Family Guy On Live TV?

Yes if you have cable television you can watch Family Guy on Fox.

New episodes typically air Sundays at 9:30/8:30c.

Fox will announce when the next season of Family Guy will premiere.

Can I Record Family Guy?

If you have a cable subscription that allows you to watch Family Guy live and your cable box lets you record shows you can record Family Guy to watch later.

Most modern cable boxes let you schedule recordings of shows ahead of time.

You can set your TV to record each episode as it premieres.

Some cable subscriptions allow you to watch any episode of a show whenever you want!

You can check your TV to see if it has this feature.

Similar Shows Owned By Disney

When Disney bought Fox it caused quite a stir in the adult cartoon industry.

Many fans of Family Guy and similar shows were worried about how Disney‚Äôs ownership would affect their favorite shows.

Does Disney Own American Dad?

American Dad is another adult TV show created by Seth MacFarlane.

Just like Family Guy Disney now owns the rights to American Dad.

However American Dad won‚Äôt be available on Disney+.

In the United States you still have to get Hulu to stream American Dad.

If you are a big Seth MacFarlane fan spending some money on a Hulu subscription might be worth it!

Does Disney Own The Simpsons?

Disney does own The Simpsons just as it owns Family Guy.

Though The Simpsons is another adult cartoon it is generally more family-friendly than Family Guy or American Dad.

Because of this Disney has opted to have The Simpsons join Disney+.

Does Disney Own The Cleveland Show?

Disney does own The Cleveland Show.

The Cleveland Show is another animated TV show created by Seth MacFarlane.

It ran between 2009 and 2019.

While The Cleveland Show is not available to watch on Disney+ you can watch it on STAR which is an add-on you can purchase within Disney+.

Companies are constantly buying each other.

With TV shows it‚Äôs even more confusing.

The rights to a show can get sold multiple times throughout its life.

This has left many people wondering who owns the TV show Family Guy.

Is Family Guy Owned By Disney?

Yes Family Guy is currently owned by Disney.

Disney acquired Family Guy on March 20 2019.

The company didn‚Äôt acquire Family Guy as a single show but rather as a part of a company acquisition.

Disney acquired 21st Century Fox which is the company that produces Family Guy along with many other similar shows.

By buying Fox Disney now owns all of the shows that Fox produced.

Owning Fox gives Disney all of these entertainment assets: -The Simpsons

-Family Guy

-X-Men

-Planet of the Apes

-Alien

-Predator

-The X-Files

-American Horror Story

-Ice Age

-Rio

-Home Alone

-The Sound of Music

-Miracle on 34th Street

-Titanic

-Avatar pic.twitter.com/cpTFGLGu3u ‚Äî Bloomberg Quicktake (@Quicktake) March 20 2019

While Disney did buy the Intellectual Property (IP) and overall rights they don‚Äôt own the Fox TV network.

However they do have the right to license non-local shows.

That includes Family Guy along with a host of other similar adult cartoons.

Family Guy is an adult animated TV show.

It premiered its first episode on January 31 1999.

Since the show premiered it has maintained a high level of popularity.

Over the course of the show‚Äôs lifetime it has been nominated for 12 primetime Emmy Awards.

Is Disney Going To Cancel Family Guy?

With Disney buying Fox there is concern from fans about their favorite shows being canceled.

Though Disney has the right to run 21st Century Fox in whatever way they like it doesn‚Äôt seem that Family Guy is at risk of getting canceled.

After all Disney bought the network because of its success.

It wouldn‚Äôt make sense to get rid of its most popular shows.

Is Family Guy Going To Leave Fox?

Some comments by Family Guy Creator Seth MacFarlane have left fans wondering whether the show is going to leave Fox entirely. MacFarlane tweeted:

‚ÄúTucker Carlson‚Äôs latest opinion piece once again makes me wish Family Guy was on any other network. Look Fox we both know this marriage isn‚Äôt working anymore. The sex is only once a year I don‚Äôt get along with your mother and well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been having an affair with NBC.‚Äù

Tucker Carlson‚Äôs latest opinion piece once again makes me wish Family Guy was on any other network. Look Fox we both know this marriage isn‚Äôt working anymore. The sex is only once a year I don‚Äôt get along with your mother and well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been having an affair with NBC. ‚Äî Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) August 1 2021

Many fans have suggested moving to another network owned by Disney.

While Disney has been renewed for a 21st season on Fox MacFarlane has shown signs of wanting to move away from the network entirely.

He has signed a contract with NBC to make content for them which is part of what he referenced in the tweet.

Why Is Disney Not Streaming Family Guy?

Despite the name Family Guy is not a very family-friendly show.

This is likely one of the big reasons Disney has not brought Family Guy onto the Disney+ platform.

Disney has set a limit on adult content on their platform.

For example the company made a decision that there would be no R-rated content on the platform.

Considering the kind of jokes Family Guy tends to make it‚Äôs hard to categorize the show as purely PG-13.

What Does Seth Macfarlane Think Of Disney Buying Family Guy?

Seth MacFarlane has expressed distaste for Fox and their support of controversial political pundits but what does he think of Disney buying out almost all of his shows?

Well he might be happier working with Disney than Fox but he‚Äôs still managed to make fun of the family-friendly corporation.

After the acquisition Family Guy aired an episode called ‚ÄúDisney‚Äôs The Reboot.‚Äù

This was a very ‚Äúmeta‚Äù episode where Family Guy basically talked about itself and the Disney acquisition.

In the episode Disney decides to refresh the Family Guy show by creating three different reboots.

The three reboot pilot episodes are then shown to focus groups which tear the episodes apart.

The episode isn‚Äôt very hard on Disney.

Perhaps part of this is because Family Guy wanted to test the waters and determine what they could get away with.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly Family Guy writer Alec Sulkin described the process of creating the Disney episode.

He said that there had been an increase in emails making sure that different parts of the episodes were cleared with higher-ups.

Overall though he indicated that the production of the show hadn‚Äôt changed much and the tone and content were set to continue uninterrupted.

Will Family Guy Get New Opportunities Because Of The Disney Acquisition?

While some fans might be nervous to learn about the acquisition because of how family-friendly Disney is others might see this as a potential opportunity for the show.

However it is unlikely that Disney is going to change Family Guy much even in terms of new opportunities.

Disney has a history of fiercely protecting the different brands they acquire and create.

This is part of the reason they aren‚Äôt putting every show they own onto the Disney+ platform.

Creating different streaming services for different types of content is a way to protect the brands of different shows and keep them separated.

Another reason the show will likely remain largely unchanged is that it is still being produced in the same studio.

Disney knows that the value of its acquisition lies in the fact these studios already do good work and they try to keep the changes minimal when possible.

However it might also result in some forms of limitation that Family Guy didn‚Äôt face before.

Richard Appel a Family Guy writer gave one example of this in an interview with E! Apple said that if the show asked for a Starwars crossover they would likely be told no.

He also points out that 10 years ago they were doing Star Wars episodes with the blessing of Lucasfilm.

Since Disney owns both brands now it is likely they will want to keep them separate.

Will Disney Change The Simpsons?

Unlike Family Guy or American Dad The Simpsons did make it on the Disney+ platform.

This might make fans wonder if the show will be censored by Disney to make it more family friendly.

Family Guy producer Michael Price gave an interview with CBR in which he confirmed that the show won‚Äôt be censored even after being placed on the more family-friendly platform of Disney+.

Is Family Guy On Netflix?

Family Guy is on Netflix.

You won‚Äôt find the entire show there though‚Äîonly the first eight seasons.

If you already have Netflix this means you can enjoy eight seasons of Family Guy without any additional cost.

Is Family Guy On Disney+?

Yes since Family Guy is owned by Disney it is on Disney+ in some countries!

Whether Disney+ includes Family Guy depends on the country you are in. In the U.K. Australia and Canada Disney + includes Family Guy.

If you do live in one of these countries you are in luck.

Unlike Netflix you are not just limited to the first eight seasons.

If you do not live in one of the countries that include Star content you will have to pay for the Disney+ bundle that includes Star if you want to watch Family Guy.

Does Hulu Have Family Guy?

Hulu does include the entire Family Guy series.

This is great news if you want to be able to watch the show from beginning to end.

Hulu also offers a free trial for 30 days.

If you wanted to watch the show for free you could simply sign up for the free trial and then cancel before the 30-day period was up!

If you do want to try to watch all of Family Guy for free in one month you might want to set aside some big chunks of time in your schedule.

To watch every episode of the show would take 165 hours.

That is 5.5 hours every day over a 30-day period! There are currently 389 episodes of Family Guy.

That means if you watch one episode a day it will take you over a year to complete the entire series!

Is Family Guy On Live TV?

Yes if you have cable television you can watch Family Guy on Fox.

New episodes typically air Sundays at 9:30/8:30c.

Fox will announce when the next season of Family Guy will premiere.

Can I Record Family Guy?

If you have a cable subscription that allows you to watch Family Guy live and your cable box lets you record shows you can record Family Guy to watch later.

Most modern cable boxes let you schedule recordings of shows ahead of time.

You can set your TV to record each episode as it premieres.

Some cable subscriptions allow you to watch any episode of a show whenever you want!

You can check your TV to see if it has this feature.

Similar Shows Owned By Disney

When Disney bought Fox it caused quite a stir in the adult cartoon industry.

Many fans of Family Guy and similar shows were worried about how Disney‚Äôs ownership would affect their favorite shows.

Does Disney Own American Dad?

American Dad is another adult TV show created by Seth MacFarlane.

Just like Family Guy Disney now owns the rights to American Dad.

However American Dad won‚Äôt be available on Disney+.

In the United States you still have to get Hulu to stream American Dad.

If you are a big Seth MacFarlane fan spending some money on a Hulu subscription might be worth it!

Does Disney Own The Simpsons?

Disney does own The Simpsons just as it owns Family Guy.

Though The Simpsons is another adult cartoon it is generally more family-friendly than Family Guy or American Dad.

Because of this Disney has opted to have The Simpsons join Disney+.

Does Disney Own The Cleveland Show?

Disney does own The Cleveland Show.

The Cleveland Show is another animated TV show created by Seth MacFarlane.

It ran between 2009 and 2019.

While The Cleveland Show is not available to watch on Disney+ you can watch it on STAR which is an add-on you can purchase within Disney+.

This article explains how to use the free Garmin Connect Course Creator tool to map cycling and running routes online and then export them to your Garmin sports GPS device.



Getting Started

To begin using Course Creator start a free account at Garmin Connect if you don't already have one. You will make the best use of Garmin Connect and Course Creator if you also own a Garmin sports GPS device but you don't need one to create and share courses online.

Access the Garmin Account Sign In page and select Create One under the form. Enter your name and email address choose a password for your account and then select Create Account.

Once you're logged in you can access the full website and begin making a course.

Fred Zahradnik

From the left-hand menu open Training and then Courses to launch the Courses page. Choose Create a Course to open the Select a Course Type window. Pick a course type from the dropdown menu. Your options include Running Hiking Road Cycling and several others. Pick Custom as the Drawing Method and then hit Continue. Another option is called Round Trip which is an easy way to quickly build a course that has a particular distance. However the following steps are for making a custom course not a round trip course. Select the map to make a starting point or use the Location search bar at the top of that page to start somewhere that isn't nearby. You can zoom very close to the map so be sure to utilize that ability to make sure you're selecting the correct roads and paths that you want included in your course. Select the map again to make another course point and keep doing that until you're finished building the course. The Course Creator tool will display total mileage in real time as you create the path. Note the options on the left side of the map. You can have your course points follow popularity routing or roads or you can even make the course follow your every move with the Freehand option which will create direct lines from each of your course points. If you wish to do a loop route click your way to the last point you want to be sure to hit and then select Loop to Start to finish it out. There's more on these options below. Name your course with the pencil icon and then select Save New Course.

Course Types

The Course Creator tool does a good job of tracking roads when you have the Follow Roads option enabled. If you pick Freehand for a truly custom course make sure to watch closely at where you're clicking; the line between each selection is straight and doesn't factor in buildings or yards.

If you wish to plan out a course where you go to the ending point and then return to the starting point following the exact same path you can do that too. Just map out the path and then choose Out and Back from the left pane in the map.

Editing any course is as easy as clicking and dragging intermediate points. For example if you want to move your course south by a few blocks find the line that is too far and drag the blue point down a few streets. The rest of the course will auto-adjust to make it work.

Sharing and Exporting Your Course

When you've built and saved your course it appears in your courses list accessible through the Training menu as described above. When you open a course you can keep it private or use the Make Public link to share it.

Sharing a Garmin Connect course is as easy as sharing the URL. Copy the link in your browser and share it with anyone so that they can view the course details like the distance map points elevation etc. They can also download your map in the GPX or FIT file format.

Keep in mind that when you share a course anyone with the link can see exactly where the course begins and ends something you might not want to share if the course includes your home address.

One of the neatest tricks of Course Creator is the ability to export your course to your Garmin GPS device. Simply connect your Garmin to your computer via its included USB cable and then select Send to Device. This works only if you have Garmin Express installed.

About the Garmin Connect Service

If you're an active cyclist or runner you've probably at least dabbled with online mileage and training logs. These online services add tremendous value to your training information. When used with data uploaded from a sports GPS device they take virtually all of the tedium out of capturing storing and analyzing training data.

Complementing online training logs have been services such as Map My Ride which provide utilities that let you map measure and pre-plan routes.

Garmin has successfully combined the features of online training logs and online route planning and mapping services in its free Garmin Connect service. The route planning and mapping feature specifically is called Course Creator. With Course Creator you can also export a route file to your Garmin GPS device.

The export feature is terrific if you want to pre-map a new route in a new location. A mapping GPS such as the Garmin Edge 800 can provide you with turn-by-turn directions from a pre-loaded route.

Is there a difference? And does it matter when you're using your bike computer or smartwatch?

While most of us now take using technology to record a bike ride for granted there's some extremely clever science helping our devices know where we are where we want to get to and how long it will take us to get there ‚Äì and that science is changing and improving every day.

All the best cycling computers and best smartwatches for cycling use global satellite systems to pinpoint our location but whilst we routinely describe the tech as GPS it is GNSS that's actually the correct naming convention.

But what is GPS? Who operates the system? Is it better than GNSS? And how does all this satellite magic work anyway? Read on to get a crash course in satellite navigation in this expert GPS vs GNSS guide.

GPS vs GNSS: what‚Äôs the difference?

What is GPS? ‚ÄúGPS stands for ‚ÄòGlobal Positioning System‚Äô‚Äô and is the name for just one of the many satellite operating systems that criss-cross the earth's orbit‚Äù says Rich Robinson head of UK product at Garmin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs owned and operated by the very cool-sounding United States Space Force.‚Äù

That‚Äôs GPS sorted. So what is GNSS? ‚ÄùGNSS or ‚ÄòGlobal Navigation Satellite System‚Äô is the generic term that describes all of the satellite systems that are owned by nations and governing bodies across the globe.

""I always think of the 'Hoover' analogy when describing GPS and GNSS‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúHoover became synonymous with vacuum cleaners as one of the original brands. The same with GPS. It was the first global navigation satellite systems but now it‚Äôs one of a handful of systems in operation.‚Äù

How does GNSS work on my bike computer and smartwatch?

Light travels at the incomprehensibly fast speed of 300000 km/s (186000 miles/s) ‚Äìand so do the radio waves from a satellite.

While this seems instantaneous to human brains there‚Äôs actually a time lag as information is sent from around 11000 miles overhead. This time lag can be measured by your GPS/GNSS device.

In his book Zoom author Bob Berman describes how this is factored in to calculating your exact position on the ground:

‚ÄúA GPS satellite contains an automatic clock that send out time signals"" he writes. ‚ÄúThe receiver recognises that it's the wrong time. Wrong because the signal travelling at light speed required one-twentieth of a second to arrive.

""Your GPS which knows the right time instantly calculates how far the satellite must be for the signal to have been delayed for exactly that amount of time. It does this with three or four satellites and thus triangulates where your position must be. All by using the known speed of light.‚Äù

Dual frequency receivers are able to detect and ignore reflected satellite signals giving you better location accuracy. (Image credit: Garmin)

Do GPS and other GNSS systems work the same way?

‚ÄúFundamentally all satellite systems operate the same way‚Äù says Dean Thomas position navigation and time consultant to the UK Space Agency. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the number of satellites in operation and the number of frequencies that are different.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's important to remember the basics when thinking about how a receiver like a bike computer works‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúEach satellite network uses different space planes and slots depending on the number of satellites that make up the system which is known as a constellation.

‚ÄúEach GNSS use orbital planes surrounding Earth in the Medium Earth Orbit this is because it's considered the best place for lots of factors including getting the most coverage of earth for the fewest number of satellites.

""Take GPS. Its satellites are positioned in six equally-spaced planes and each plane plane contains four 'slots' occupied by baseline satellites. This 24-slot arrangement ensures users can view at least four satellites from virtually any point on the planet.

""Some receivers like your bike computers will use a dual- or tri-[band] operating system such as GPS GLONASS and Galileo. This provides more accuracy than just GPS alone especially in the more remote parts of the world or where densely built up urban areas or tree cover can block or reflect a signal.

""Having dual frequency will make a big impact‚Äù Thomas continues ‚Äúas it's where you get even more granular information closer to that one-metre accuracy.

""Satellites transmit several different frequencies. There are military signals which of course are restricted and closed but consumer devices like a bike computer will depending on satellites they are receiving from use two L1 and L5 frequencies. These will give you much better accuracy in positioning.

‚ÄúIt's currently only GPS that has the technology that will allow the dual-frequency system. Other GNSS will eventually operate on this dual-band system but it will take a while for them to be replaced with that functionality.

The Garmin Edge 1040 Solar is both both multi-band and multi-GNSS (Image credit: Future)

‚ÄúTracking and mapping devices that can use both multi-band and multi-GNSS are significantly improved from ones that don't‚Äù Thomas explains.

‚ÄúReceivers that do both are able to detect and reject rogue signals. This means that in dense urban areas or where there is a lot of tree cover the two frequencies working together have a much stronger chance of ensuring that you receive the correct information as to your location.‚Äù

""Although your accuracy of location will depend on the strength of your processor and mapping capabilities. This is why your mobile phone is one of the most accurate location detectors as phone companies have been using the technology for a long time. It‚Äôs only now that other devices such as bike computers are catching up as the technology becomes cheaper and more readily available.‚Äù

Which satellite system is which? (Image credit: GettyImages)

Who owns the GPS and GNSS satellite systems?

Declared operational in 1995 GPS is the name for the USA‚Äôs state-owned satellites and is committed to maintaining at least 24 operational satellites 95 percent of the time. In order to deliver this the US Space Force has been flying 31 operational GPS satellites for over a decade. (According to the official GPS website as of 26 June 2022 there are 26 operational satellites in the constellation ‚Äì ‚Äúnot including decommissioned on-orbit spares‚Äù.

‚ÄúIn reality there are four satellite constellations that are used on a daily basis‚Äù says Mark Bacon head of space security at the UK Space Agency. ""These are GPS GLONASS Galileo and BeiDou. Consumers can access these with their receiving device for free and typically get an accurate geolocation pin of between one to three metres depending on how many constellations and frequencies their device can process.‚Äù

There are several other global navigation satellite systems in operation that you may have heard of. According to Bacon however most won't really be a factor when using your bike computer.

Here's a breakdown of the full global navigation satellite systems and who owns them:

GPS (Global Positioning System): 26 satellites owned and operated by the US government

26 satellites owned and operated by the US government BDS (BeiDou Navigation Satellite System): 35 satellites owned and operated by China (previously known as Compass)

35 satellites owned and operated by China (previously known as Compass) Galileo: 24+ satellites operated by the European Union

24+ satellites operated by the European Union GLONASS (Globalnaya Navigazionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema): 24+ satellites owned and operated by the Russian Federation

24+ satellites owned and operated by the Russian Federation IRNSS / NavIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System / Navigation India Constellation): Seven satellites owned and operated by the government of India.

Seven satellites owned and operated by the government of India. QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System): Four operational satellites expanding to seven by 2023. Owned by the government of Japan operated by QZS System Service Inc

""At the moment most other constellations augment the three main ones‚Äù says Bacon. ‚ÄúSome systems are still in their infancy like QZSS [which is] owned by the Japanese Government [and] is really a tag on to GPS. It has been positioned to specifically support dense urban cities in Japan such as Tokyo which can be really affected by the urban canyon issue"". (An 'urban canyon' is a city street flanked by tall buildings which can block satellite signal just as a mountain might in a rural environment.)

‚ÄúGPS is the most prevalent satellite system and can be ‚Äòseen' by a receiver such as your bike computer smartwatch or smartphone almost anywhere in the world. But in theory you could have a bike computer that worked solely on GLONASS or Galileo satellites if you wanted although people would probably still call it a GPS unit"".

Privately owned constellations

There are also now a significant and ever increasing number of privately owned satellite fleets. Some of these such as the Iridium satellite network offer users a more interactive service with functions like third-person tracking location sharing and two-way emergency SOS messaging without a phone signal ‚Äì as well as satellite phones.

The key difference between government and privately owned satellite systems is that the former are freely available to all users worldwide to provide positioning navigation and timing services globally. The more integrative systems often require a user subscription before you can take advantage of their services.

GPS vs GNSS: tracking and mapping

Even if you have a multi-GNSS and multi-frequency unit that doesn't mean that your accuracy is going to be military grade.

‚ÄúRemember when bike computers or data tracking watches first came out? You could spot the early adopters a mile off as they were standing still on a race start line trying to pick up a satellite signal‚Äù says Garmin‚Äôs Rich Robinson.

‚ÄúThat was because you were literally waiting for a satellite to move into a position that you could receive a signal. Thankfully on the more recent navigation devices that use more than one GNSS it will be able to call upon any satellite system in order to receive the swiftest pick-up. If it is a GPS (which in all likelihood it will be due to its prevalence) and you have multi-band frequency too you'll get the most accurate data.

‚ÄúIt used to be a thing that the more GNSS your receiver was able to process the quicker your battery would drain. That's a real myth these days for 99.9% of the population and it's more likely to be a bigger processor (which is busy turning the signal in to usable data) that has a bigger impact on the unit‚Äôs battery life.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe accuracy you get still depends on your mapping‚Äù Robinson adds. ‚ÄúGPS likes straight lines. When it comes to plotting a route unless you go plotting mad and put in a pin on every single bend or turn ‚Äì which will make your device slower as it's storing all that information ‚Äì you'll just get straight lines from when you last picked up a signal.

""This can be made even worse if your device is set in a power saving mode tracking a signal every couple of minutes. You might find yourself wildly out of position or if you are recording your route over or under on distance or altitude.

""This isn't a huge issue on the open road but in cities or off-road riding with lots of twists and turns this can lead to you getting completely lost.

‚ÄúThe more processing power your device has the more likely that it will use something called a SmartData algorithm that irons out straight lines into a more realistic route especially if it‚Äôs been ridden before using the same platform as it can use the information to get more accuracy from analysing multiple similar datasets and draw a more accurate picture.

""Of course that level of information requires a lot of processing up to 60 times that of a device that doesn't have the same accuracy which is super-power hungry. This is why batteries need to be so good these days just to support the technology that is available.‚Äù

Why can‚Äôt I get a decent satellite signal?

You've got the multi-GNSS multi-band SmartData tracking huge processor and immense battery reserves but you still can't pick up a signal. What's up with that?

""Assuming your all-singing receiving device is actually working properly and you are in the northern hemisphere there‚Äôs really only signal-jamming that would impact on consumers"" says Thomas of the UK Space Agency.

‚ÄúNever say never in regards to the owner of a satellite system suddenly not allowing consumers to use its network but on the bases that no classified information will ever be used on that system there‚Äôs no reason to switch off broadcasting.

‚ÄúIf you find yourself in certain vicinities and there seems to be a blanket no signal you may find that it's high level military signal jamming. This is high power and will create a signal black hole for miles around. It‚Äôs highly unlikely that it will impact your regular bike computer or fitness trainer but it can happen.

Here at Cycling Weekly we were easily able to find when GPS jamming exercises were taking place so worth checking in advance if you are planning a ride need military bases.

Thomas reassures us that ""there certainly isn't a cause for concern that you are being tracked by a satellite system operator ‚Äì no one at that level wants to know where you are riding your bike.

""Someone's boss on the other had might. Although illegal in most countries privacy jammers that block satellite signals can block the signal for your receiver too. They are used to shield location detectors that are often fitted to work vans so if you scratching your head wondering why you can‚Äôt get a signal on a good day in open terrain check you‚Äôre not standing next to a white trades van especially if the driver is having a nap.

‚ÄúUnfortunately similar systems are becoming more popular in vehicle theft with the culprits fixing a GNSS signal jammer to a stolen car abandoning it while it's still hot before returning to it a few days later. Again if you are in a signal black hole this could be why.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9pLWp1c3QtdHJpZWQtYXBwbGUtd2F0Y2gtd2l0aC1zd2luZ3Zpc2lvbi1mb3ItdGVubmlzLWhlcmVzLXdoYXQtaGFwcGVuZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I just tried Apple Watch SwingVision to up my tennis game ‚Äî here's what happened,"If you know how to use the Apple Watch you might know it‚Äôs great for tracking basic walks or runs but it‚Äôs also capable of tracking a wide variety of workout and sport types. In my case those workout types are often inspiration to try activities I wouldn‚Äôt do otherwise.

Take tennis for example. I played some tennis as a teenager and even took a few lessons to learn the game. It didn‚Äôt stick at the time but I‚Äôve recently rediscovered an interest after reading about how tennis is one of those ‚Äúlifelong‚Äù sports you can play for decades like golf. And after seeing my Apple Watch has a designed preset for tracking tennis in the workout app the promise of closing my Apple Watch rings motivated me to hit my local court.

It‚Äôs one thing to play tennis in Switch Sports on my Nintendo Switch. Clutching the worn grip of my old racket in my hand while bouncing a fresh-out-of-the-can tennis ball on concrete is something else entirely. It‚Äôs something that felt soothing at first then a bit spunky as I started moving around the court for a volley with my dad.

Tracking tennis with Apple Watch

The workout app in watchOS 9 has been redesigned but the Apple Watch has been able to track tennis for several years. It doesn‚Äôt have auto-tracking like walking running or outdoor cycling so I had to locate and launch the workout among all the choices on my wrist (though I could‚Äôve also asked Siri to start a tennis workout.)

As is the case for a majority of workout types the Apple Watch Series 7 on my wrist monitored my heart rate calories burned and time elapsed for tennis. Again these are the same metrics I saw when I tried wearing my Apple Watch for hot yoga and went paddleboarding with my Apple Watch.

It took a bit for me to remember the rhythm of the game and refine my form. But eventually I picked up my pace around the court as reflected by my heart rate. I kept my Apple Watch on my left wrist where I normally wear it so it didn‚Äôt get in the way of my right-handed serves or forearm shots. Though as one of the best smartwatches for sports it sits flush enough to my wrist that it didn‚Äôt interfere with backhand swings either. Meanwhile the form-fitting Solo Loop one of the best Apple Watch bands kept the device secure to my wrist.

By the time I tired out I had burned almost 200 calories making a major dent in my activity rings. I also walked home from the court clear-minded feeling like the movement offered a sort of meditation I might find in Apple Fitness Plus or in the Headspace app I‚Äôve started using recently.

SwingVision for Apple Watch

(Image credit: Future)

If you‚Äôre looking to take your tennis game to the next level you might want to know about SwingVision. As one of the best Apple Watch apps for sports (it was even featured in an Apple Watch ad) SwingVision leverages AI as well as the technology in Apple devices to create comprehensive reports of how you play.

I had the opportunity to try out SwingVision with representatives from the company incorporating a demo of the technology with a short tennis lesson. The program required two devices for data collection: an iPad Pro overlooking the court from a very tall tripod and the Apple Watch on my wrist. But unlike playing tennis on my own I had to switch my watch to my right hand for accurate swing analysis.

During the lesson the SwingVision app on my wrist tracked my heart rate calories distance moved and number of shots. And after each individual shot I could see specific details about my swing. Based on the movement of my wrist SwingVision identified what kind of shot I made how fast I hit the ball and the rotational speed of the ball. It quickly became a game for me to swing as fast as possible while keeping my shots in play.

For close calls at the lines the iPad Pro‚Äôs recording could review the play thanks to the device‚Äôs 12MP Ultra Wide camera. Then after the session we looked at the data collected by the iPad Pro to see how I fared.

The SwingVision AI can filter every shot from the session based on what kind of swing I made and whether the shot was in or out. It can display the data on the graphic map of the court as well as create video highlight reels ‚Äî or lowlight reels if you‚Äôre looking to work on trouble areas. The data and videos are then easily shareable with a coach or parent.

Should you try SwingVision?

As someone who loves sports stats SwingVision delivers all the juicy data I want to know. Regrettably becoming the next Serena Williams isn‚Äôt in the cards for me so I don‚Äôt know what this data will help me.

Still the free-tier of SwingVision supports up to two hours of shot tracking video analysis and cloud storage per month. That‚Äôs probably more time than I‚Äôll get to play on a monthly basis making it a no-brainer to keep using the app for shot tracking from my wrist. I mean how else will I know whether I‚Äôm getting better at slices?

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll use it with an iPad Pro mostly because I don‚Äôt own an iPad Pro and because it does require set-up before playing. SwingVision sells a fence mount that‚Äôs supposed to take some of the hassle out of getting a session started but again I‚Äôm comfortable in the ‚Äúcasual player‚Äù category.

That‚Äôs not to say I don‚Äôt see the value in the full experience. In fact it‚Äôs great to see in-depth sport data democratized in a way anyone can work on their game. Apparently the only way to get the type of data formulated by SwingVision a few years ago was with a $10000 system installed on Pro-only courts. Now with a $149.99/year SwingVision subscription any player and any coach have access to highly-advanced tennis data with the help of some Apple devices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9maXRiaXQtc2Vuc2UtdnMtZml0Yml0LXZlcnNhLTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fitbit Sense vs Fitbit Versa 3: Which is better?,"When picking the best Fitbit it‚Äôs fair to ask ‚Äúshould I buy the Fitbit Sense vs the Fitbit Versa 3?‚Äù The models are remarkably similar although there are some key differences under the surface.

While Fitbit made its name with more bracelet-styled fitness trackers the Versa 3 and Sense show the manufacturer embracing a smartwatch-like design. They are both easily among the best fitness trackers you can buy right now and also feature in our round-up of the best Fitbits.

That said they‚Äôre not quite on the same level as the likes of the best Garmin watches or the Apple Watch Series 7 ‚Äì the interface on Fitbits is still app-based and there are very limited third-party connections on the watches. But what the models lack in fancy features they make up for with a low price and long battery life.

So without further ado here‚Äôs a thorough breakdown of the Fitbit Sense vs Fitbit Versa 3 ‚Äì which will come out on top?

Which is cheaper?

Both the Fitbit Sense and the Versa 3 are perched atop the Fitbit pyramid in terms of features so they represent the most premium models available from the company.

The Fitbit Versa 3 comes in at $229.95 although it can be found retailing for around $80 less if you do some digging. Meanwhile the Fitbit Sense will set you back $299.95 but again you can find it for considerably less (we recently spotted it on sale for $219.)

Which is more accurate?

In our testing across a variety of workouts both the Sense and the Versa 3 were equally as accurate.

Since both offer GPS we were able to run without having a phone connected. Both picked up our location within seconds and both tracked steps and distance within just a few metres of each other. It‚Äôd be fair to say that a dedicated running watch (like the Garmin Forerunner 255) would be more accurate but it would also be a lot more expensive.

Both also have water resistance and in testing with a pool swim both tracked lengths consistently with no issues with functionality (although operating a touchscreen device with wet hands is a challenge on both models).

Which looks better?

The Fitbit Sense and the Versa 3 look very similar. Both offer a 1.58-inch OLED screen with color support which is easy to read in sunlight. The bezel around the display is slim too and there are no physical buttons ‚Äì although there is a touch-sensitive section on one side. The screen is covered in Gorilla Glass to make the entire thing more durable.

If you‚Äôre upgrading from a smaller Fitbit Inspire 2 you may be surprised at how big it is. The Versa 3 weighs in at 27.21g while the Sense is slightly heavier at 31.75g. When testing them out we found this difference to be negligible.

They both offer swappable straps which clip on and off with ease and whichever one you opt for they come with no metallic moving pieces. The idea is that this helps the ‚ÄúInfinity Band‚Äù last longer.

So what is different? Aside from the slight difference in weight the only indicator of whether you have a Fitbit Sense or Versa 3 in your hands is the color option. The Sense comes in soft gold silver stainless steel and graphite stainless steel.

The Versa 3 is a little more varied with four options; black gold (with midnight blue strap) gold (with pink strap) and thistle (essentially gold with a purple/gray strap).

The two are so similar though that it‚Äôll come down to personal preference.

Which model offers more features?

The Fitbit Sense has two sensors above what‚Äôs offered by the Fitbit Versa 3: the EDA and ECG scans.

The former in basic terms tracks the electromagnetic current of your skin which is affected by active sweat secretion. This is influenced by your nervous system so in theory the higher the reading the higher your stress levels. To get a reading you simply place your palm over the screen of the device and wait.

An ECG is a way of identifying atrial fibrillation also known as an irregular heartbeat. While it‚Äôs fairly rare to find EDA sensors in wearables ECG sensors are common across other devices. Neither of these features are available on the Versa 3.

Aside from the above the two models offer a similar array of tracking features. You can track steps blood oxygen levels heart rate distance calories burned sleep and plenty more on either device with everything feeding back into the excellent Fitbit app so you can read your data at a glance.

Both also include six months of Fitbit Premium an additional subscription that adds personalized training resting and diet options to your Fitbit.

Which is better for tracking workouts?

Both Fitbit models allow for plenty of workout types with over twenty available right out of the box on each.

That means there‚Äôs an option for the basics like walking running and cycling as well as more gym-based workouts like weights stairclimbers and circuit training and sports ones like tennis golf and more.

Again there‚Äôs nothing to choose from between the two in terms of the number or variety of workouts.

Which has better battery life?

Again it‚Äôs a little tough to pick a winner here. Because both share the same chassis with presumably the same battery size (Fitbit doesn‚Äôt denote the size of the internal battery) the actual battery life is dependent on which of the features you‚Äôre using.

If you‚Äôre taking regular ECGs on the Fitbit Sense for example you‚Äôll see the battery life drop lower than the Versa 3 with standard use.

Verdict

Given the fairly slimline differences between the Fitbit Sense and the Fitbit Versa 3 it‚Äôd be fair to say the Sense comes out on top in terms of features ‚Äì the EDA and ECG scans make it the most feature-packed Fitbit around.

That‚Äôs perhaps oversimplifying things though ‚Äì if you‚Äôre not looking for either of those features you can save $80 and be just as happy with the Versa 3.

Of course it may just come down to color options particularly if a discount brings the pricing of both models closer together. In any case both the Fitbit Sense and the Fitbit Versa 3 are excellent fitness trackers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FkZ2V0c2FuZHdlYXJhYmxlcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9nYXJtaW4tZm9yZXJ1bm5lci05NTUtYmF0dGVyeS1kcmFpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Software update fixes Garmin Forerunner 955 battery drain,"5 min read

The latest software beta that goes under number 12.20 fixes one of the main causees of the Garmin Forerunner 955 battery drain problem.

The watch was released alongside the Forerunner 255 back in June. The 955 is perhaps Garmin‚Äôs greatest watch yet ‚Äì at least in terms of ability. It has a few new recovery metrics namely HRV Status and Daily Training Readiness which add a whole new dimension to your training. Granted we are expecting other Garmin devices to inherit this ability namely the Fenix 7 range and Epix 2 ‚Äì and the features are already in Beta on these devices.

Garmin Forerunner 955 ‚Äì battery drain

The advertised battery life of the Forerunner 955 is 15 days between charges with typical use or 42 hours in GPS-only mode without music. Of course switch the all-systems GNSS mode on and this comes swiftly down to around 20 hours.

These figures improve slightly on what you can expect on the 945 line. Of course there‚Äôs also a solar option of the 955 which (in ideal conditions) adds 5 days to smartwatch mode and 7 hours to GPS-only mode without music.

Essential reading: Garmin Forerunner 955 vs Fenix 7 ‚Äì comparison feature

But does the device live up to these battery life claims? The answer if you read the Garmin Forums over the past few months is ‚Äì perhaps not.

There‚Äôs a long thread there discussing battery consumption on the device. It seems that some people are experiencing a battery drain issue.

‚ÄúI have noticed an unexpected battery drain where I am losing about 10% per day even on the days when I‚Äôm not using GPS. Glad I‚Äôm not the only one.‚Äù says one person.

‚ÄúAlso losing a lot. Lost around 10% without any activities over a 12 hour period. No notification etc as those disabled SO2 also off.‚Äù another one chimes in.

Granted the forum thread is a mix of people reporting the issue and those saying there are not experiencing a battery drain. So it‚Äôs a mixed bag.

I‚Äôve had my Garmin Forerunner 955 since June and am getting battery consumption that is more or less in line with the advertised figures. With all-night SpO2 monitoring switched on it equates to about 5-6% on days that I don‚Äôt train. Which is what I would expect.

I would suggest to stick to default watch-faces at the outset. For example it is good to avoid watch-faces such as Titanium which has been reported to be a battery hog. That may be part of the explanation for the poor performance you are seeing. Stick to watch-faces which do not have too many data fields. And avoid using the data fields which require high refresh rates.

Essential reading: Garmin Forerunner 955 vs 255 ‚Äì which should you get?

You can always do a reset by holding down power button for 30 sec and powering back up. This has been known to clear battery issues with other Garmin devices.

Of course there is an outside chance your Forerunner 955 could be faulty. In which case you should return your device.

Garmin Forerunner 955 battery drain fixed?

In fairness the device hasn‚Äôt been around for very long. A battery drain with certain configurations of the watch might be a price you need to pay if you are an early adopter.

The company has had these types of problems before. You just need to go back a couple of months for the most recent occurrence. Firmware update 21.00 for Garmin Fenix 6 brought a bunch of useful features. But for some users it also brought heavy battery consumption.

The good news is that Garmin has found the cause of the problem on the Forerunner 955.

‚ÄúWe believe that we have a fix for this report that will be rolling out with the next software release for this device. While I do not have a timetable for this release I will be updating this thread as information is made available. Thank you for your patience while we work towards a resolution for this report.‚Äù one of the Garmin forum moderators wrote a few days ago.

Now the company has released firmware 12.20 which fixes the issue. It is in Beta currently and should reach public release in the weeks ahead.

Early reports are that this does indeed help to rectify the problem. It seems to address the main cause of the battery drain ‚Äì the post activity behaviour of the watch. Most of the users reported the heaviest battery drain after a run or cycle. Whether the GPS remained connected is not clear but restarting the watch after an activity stopped the battery drain. With Beta 12.20 you no longer need to do this. So a massive improvement.

Part of this update is also SatIQ which is something else that can help to extend battery life. When enabled it will automatically choose the most power-efficient mode for satellite connectivity while not jeopardising accuracy.

Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies

A small primer in case you don‚Äôt know what is the Gartner Hype Cycle. Gartner is one of the most respected business analysis companies in the world and every year it releases a graph of the disruptive innovative technologies to keep an eye on: the Hype Cycle. This graph shows what technologies may be disruptive for the short and long-term future and so what technologies big companies should start working with because they could create opportunities for them or disrupt their own business. The graph is called the ‚ÄúHype Cycle‚Äù because it puts the technologies on a curve that highlights the typical reception of a disruptive technology:

At first the technology gets discovered (Innovation Trigger)

(Innovation Trigger) Then everyone starts getting hyped and think that that technology is going to disrupt everything and be useful for everything (Peak of Inflated Expectations)

and think that that technology is going to disrupt everything and be useful for everything (Peak of Inflated Expectations) Then people realize that that technology can‚Äôt match the exaggerated expectations set up by the hype so they are disappointed (Trough of disillusionment)

Then the technology evolves and starts finding its real use cases (Slope of Enlightenment)

(Slope of Enlightenment) In the end the technology becomes useful and widely adopted. It is not special anymore but mainstream (Plateau of productivity)

While you read those bullet points probably you have also thought about the story of VR hyped with the DK2 and Facebook‚Äôs acquisition of Oculus; rejected as a ‚Äúfad‚Äù when the Rift CV1 and the Vive couldn‚Äôt reach the expected sales; started being considered again with the Quest and now it‚Äôs quasi-mainstream with kids asking a Quest 2 for Christmas to their parents.

The Hype Cycle gets released every year and is a graph that most business managers consider with great interest: if a technology is put there it means that has a lot of potential for the future.

Gartner Hype Cycle for 2022

Gartner has examined more than 2000 technologies and chose 25 that defined as ‚Äúmust-know innovations to drive competitive differentiation and efficiency‚Äù. These 25 special technologies have then been inserted into the hype cycle:

The Gartner Hype Cycle for 2022 (Image by Gartner)

As we can see there are some technologies that we all know: the metaverse web3 NFT and digital humans to name a few. All these technologies are what we are dreaming of for the next 5 to 10 years. Immersive realities are so important for Gartner that it also identified them as one of the macro themes for 2022. The three macro-themes are in fact:

Expand immersive experiences

Accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) automation

Optimize technologist delivery

You can read a bit more on Gartner‚Äôs 2022 Hype Cycle in its dedicated release blog post.

Analyzing the chart

It‚Äôs not the first time that Gartner puts immersive realities in its hype cycle and also when it happened with AR and VR I agreed on the fact that they should have been in the graph but I didn‚Äôt agree with their position. For instance saying that ‚ÄúMetaverse‚Äù is just rising now on the hype sounds a bit weird considering that since Zuck‚Äôs announcement of Meta at Facebook Connect the web has been filled with posts about the metaverse and all the trillions it may give us. NFTs are reported as having just passed the hype but actually we are now into ‚Äúthe cryptocrash‚Äù so in my opinion they are more in the trough of disillusionment. I personally think that all these technologies should be more on the right than where they are but probably Gartner has its own metrics to evaluate this position or maybe it considers these technologies from different standpoints than mine (e.g. from the consumers‚Äô point of view or business owners‚Äô point of view).

Anyway it is super-important that metaverse digital humans web3 and other similar tech have entered this cycle: this means that Gartner validates how they can be disruptive for our future. This will lead to more companies wanting to enter the ecosystem and making investments in our field. It‚Äôs a very important endorsement in my opinion which can only bring positive consequences for all of us. I guess that many startups (mine included) will put this graph in their pitch deck.

It is relevant how two of the macro trends are immersive realities and AI. These fields are very connected as NVIDIA managers told me when I spoke with them. AI for instance will lead to the creation of smart interfaces for our AR glasses which will understand what is happening in our surroundings and suggest to us what to do. And AI/ML is at the basis of natural language processing which is important to have digital humans we can interact with in XR. There are many joint use cases and these technologies are relevant the one for the other that‚Äôs why it is important they are both growing trends together.

I also underline how the outlook for these technologies is quite long. The metaverse has an outlook of 10+ years to be developed and become mainstream exactly like digital humans and a bit less than web3 which is predicted to have a 5-10 years timeframe. While we all know that business analysts are not good at making accurate predictions I think that these are reasonable predictions with the data we have now. And they show once more that the road to the metaverse is still very long and complicated. Notwithstanding all the hype the predictions of the trillions coming and all people saying that we already have ‚Äúmetaverses‚Äù (I‚Äôm crying while writing this word) now actually the real metaverse is coming in a lot of years because it requires many technology disruptions plus its social acceptance.

Jake Zim says that we must be in the field for a long time

As Jake Zim told me when I interviewed him if we really believe in these technologies we must commit to staying in the field for the next 10 years. Because even if we have already walked a long road we are still in the early days and we need many years to see our dreams finally come true.

I‚Äôm in for this what about you?

First year GM Chris Drury pulled off some incredible moves to close major holes in the lineup. Here‚Äôs a quick recap of those deals.

Andrew Copp and a 2023 sixth-round pick for Morgan Barron (2) conditional second-round picks in 2022 and a 2023 fifth-round pick

Tyler Motte for a 2023 fourth-round pick

Justin Braun for a 2023 third-round pick

Frank Vatrano for a 2022 fourth-round pick

For argument‚Äôs sake we included Vatrano even though the deal occurred 5 days prior to deadline.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve all contributed. I think our scouts and staff did a great job identifying those guys as targets and we were fortunate enough to pull off the deals to get them‚Äù Drury said during the playoffs. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve certainly fit and been used extremely well by [Gerard Gallant].‚Äù

Despite those great moves to which the Rangers did not relinquish a single roster player to obtain them they did not win the Cup. That‚Äôs why the 1994 Trade Deadline still remains the biggest and most talked about in franchise history.

New York Rangers 1994 Trade Deadline

The architect of the 1994 Cup squad Neil Smith spoke with Forever Blueshirts this summer regarding a wide-range of topics. When it comes to that trade deadline Smith has been quoted often in the past. However in this interview he wanted to make clear that all those moves were his alone.

‚ÄúBelieve me when I say Mike Keenan had nothing to do with the trades that I made‚Äù Smith proclaimed. ‚ÄúI just knew he wanted the player if I got him.‚Äù

So let‚Äôs breakdown the moves with insights from the GM himself:

Tony Amonte and Matt Oates to Chicago Blackhawks for Stephane Matteau and Brian Noonan

If the Rangers don‚Äôt win the Cup in 1994 this deal would go down as one of the worst in hockey history. Amonte was just 23 years-old at the time but already had 84 goals in 234 games with the Rangers including back-to back 30+ goals seasons in his rookie and sophomore year.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always said since day one of all the trades I‚Äôve made that was the worst one‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúBut without Noonan and Matteau you don‚Äôt win the Cup.‚Äù

Mike Gartner to Toronto Maple Leafs for Glenn Anderson Scott Malone and a 4th round pick (Alexander Korobolin)

Everyone knows that Keenan was no fan of Mike Gartner‚Äôs game for whatever reason. Sadly he just didn‚Äôt like how the future hall of famer that scored 708 career goals played.

‚ÄúGlenn Anderson for Gartner‚Äù Smith began. ‚ÄúI could‚Äôve said Paul Anderson for Gartner and he would‚Äôve said ‚Äòyes.‚Äô

While Smith didn‚Äôt want to trade Gartner his reasoning behind the move made a ton of sense.

‚ÄúKeenan was going to mess up our Stanley Cup if I don‚Äôt trade Gartner‚Äù he reveals. ‚ÄúHe was not going to play Gartner and I wanted to take away any of his excuses.‚Äù

In hindsight Keenan would‚Äôve absolutely have either benched or scratched Gartner in the playoffs. It shouldn‚Äôt be forgotten that in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Final against the Devils an angry Keenan benched Mark Messier Brian Leetch and Adam Graves. The situation was so bad that Messier had to plead with him before Game 6 not to pull another stunt like that again.

Todd Marchant to Edmonton Oilers for Craig MacTavish

When it comes to the Rangers acquiring key shutdown center MacTavish it was Smith‚Äôs persistence in hounding then Oilers GM Glen Sather to get him.

‚ÄúKeenan never even asked about MacTavish. It was me from the beginning of the season bugging Sather for him‚Äù Smith admitted. ‚ÄúFinally we got to the deadline and Sather wanted Eric Cairns. I said ‚Äòno‚Äô but offered him Todd Marchant and he agreed.‚Äù

Smith humorously recalls how Sather was angry believing he was misled on Marchant‚Äôs small stature (5-10 179 lbs). It wasn‚Äôt until Smith pointed out that he was wrongly looking at Todd‚Äôs brother‚Äôs info that Sather realized his error. Terry Marchant who never played in the NHL was 6-1 and 205 lbs. Edmonton would later select him in the 6th round of the 1994 draft.

Peter Anderssonn to the Florida Panthers for a 9th round pick (Vitali Yeremeyev) and Phil Bourque to the Ottawa Senators for future considerations

Smith moved both these players simply because they needed roster space.

In the end Smith‚Äôs reputation as ‚ÄòBig Deal Neil‚Äô was on full display that spring day. On March 21 1994 he went for broke and hit pay dirt in just his fifth season as a general manager. The rest is history as his Rangers ended a Stanley Cup drought that had lasted 54 years.

‚ÄúI thought Neil did a fabulous job‚Äù Kennan said. ‚ÄúNeil brought four players who will all play for the hockey club. Only two of the four we lost would have played a significant role. We really improved our depth which is critical in the playoffs.‚Äù NHL.com

The company is moving forward with the development of Overture an airliner capable of flying at Mach 1.7 and carrying up to 80 passengers from 2029 when it hopes to certify it.

But what makes Boom‚Äôs design better than that of the iconic Concorde? And what are their differences? Which is the fastest? Which one has more autonomy?

Designing supersonic aircraft capable of being economically viable and at the same time silent has been the ‚Äúgrail‚Äù of the aerospace industry since the demise of Concorde which was never a great commercial success until the end of operation in the early 2000s.

Since then several manufacturers have tried to make such a project possible from startups like Boom to renowned organizations like Lockheed Martin and Virgin Galactic.

Founded in 2014 in the United States Boom Supersonic develops the Overture with the support of companies such as Honeywell Latecoere GE Collins Aerospace Safran Leonardo and FlightSafety.

Boom‚Äôs focus is on improving the Concorde idea to make supersonic aircraft economically sustainable. So far the startup has been able to sell the idea well and has received 130 orders 35 of which are firm orders.

Concorde Overture Length 622 m 612 m Height 113 m 11 m Wingspan 253 m 323 m Passenger capacity 92-128 65-80

Boom‚Äôs plan is optimistic with the first aircraft ready in 2026 and the first flight the following year but passenger flights are not expected to start until 2029.

Putting the Overture project alongside Concorde there are more similarities than differences. Both are just over 201 feet (60 meters long) and 36 feet (11 meters) high. The difference is in the larger wingspan of the Overture with 106 feet (32.3 m) compared to 83 feet (25.6 m) of the Concorde.

Although they have practically the same fuselage size the Overture will have a much smaller capacity than the Concorde. The Boom project is designed to carry 65 to 80 passengers while the supersonic created by BAC (BAe) and Sud Aviation (Aerospatiale) could carry 92 to 128 passengers.

Concorde Overture Cruise speed 2.160 km/h 2.082 km/h Range 6.667 km 7.871 km Altitude 18.300 m 18.300 m

In terms of capacity the new project takes into account a greater concern with fuel consumption and also greater comfort in the cabin which will have only two rows with a single seat on each side of the cabin.

Like the Concorde the Boom Overture is expected to fly at an altitude of about 60000 feet or 18300 meters well above the subsonic jets and from where it is possible to observe the curvature of the Earth.

Better range

Despite initial rumors that the Overture would cruise at Mach 2.2 or 2695 km/h the current specification is Mach 1.7 (2082 km/h). The Concorde was faster cruising at 2160 km/h and reaching up to twice the speed of sound (2470 km/h) at maximum.

Although a bit slower the Overture is expected to have a longer range of 4250 nm (7871 km) using sustainable fuel while the Concorde ranged up to 3600 nm (6667 km).

The engines are being custom developed for Overture and are called Symphony. Originally the supplier would be Rolls-Royce the company that also equipped the Concorde.

But while the Concorde‚Äôs Olympus engines used afterbunners the Symphony will do without that extra boost which means less consumption noise and pollution.

In place of the aluminum used in the Concorde the Overture will use carbon composites in the fuselage which are currently easier to produce and more resistant to the heat generated by supersonic friction.

According to Boom the aircraft with these characteristics will be able to serve on more than 600 profitable routes around the world fulfilling the segments in less than half the time of current subsonic jets.

However Boom has already confirmed that the supersonic flight will only take place over the sea. When flying over the continent Overture will maintain Mach 0.94 the same situation as Concorde which could not fly supersonic over the US.

It is an alternative to avoid the noise pollution restrictions associated with supersonic flight but that does not solve the dilemma of these jets since the ideal scenario is to fly fast in any region.

Orders

Regarding the order backlog including options Boom has already surpassed Concorde with 130 aircraft in total. Although only British Airways and Air France received seven Concordes each more than ten airlines had shown interest in the supersonic reaching around 100 purchase intentions.

United and American Airlines firm orders alone which Boom says are non-refundable add up to 35 planes which is more than the total number of Concordes manufactured in 27 years of operation (20 aircraft).

American Airlines and United Airlines had also shown interest in Concorde but later canceled the orders. After so many promises aviation fans are looking forward to seeing another supersonic passenger in operation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zdC5jb20ubXkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wOC84MjQzNTMvcHVzaC1tb3JlLWxvY2FsLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1wbGF5ZXJzJUMyJUEw0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnN0LmNvbS5teS9hbXAvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wOC84MjQzNTMvcHVzaC1tb3JlLWxvY2FsLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1wbGF5ZXJzJUMyJUEw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Push for more local aerospace players,,,,,,,,,,

Likewise the fluoroscopy x-ray market returned to growth after a year of retraction in demand in 2020 with 18% year-on-year growth in 2021 and an estimated market size of $509 million (518 million euros).

These figures taken from Signify Research's General Radiography and Fluoroscopy -- World 2022 report show a strong recovery from the challenges experienced during the heights of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Demand returns to fixed-room radiography in 2021

Demand for fixed-room digital radiography systems returned to growth in 2021 as procurement budgets were made available after having been temporarily diverted to fund mobile x-ray purchases in the early phases of the pandemic. This allowed previously planned projects to resume and upgrades and replacements to be installed.

For developed regions and countries higher-end features to help tackle the backlog are now increasingly sought after including autopositioning cameras to ensure minimal patient movement before imaging and artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis. Such features improve workflow increase the throughput of an imaging department and should help healthcare providers gradually clear some of the backlog created from the pandemic.

Conversely the digital mobile x-ray market retracted by 18% in revenue terms in 2021 closing at $684 million (672 million euros). However this decline was not as severe as previously forecast with some sustained demand remaining. During the pandemic obvious benefits of mobile imaging were reinforced including portability for bedside imaging. Growth is expected to return for mobile DR in 2024 as replacement of older mobile systems drives demand.

For mobile radiography the importance of brand loyalty in purchasing decisions also returned after temporary focus solely on inventory available during the pandemic. This allowed smaller local vendors to win significant share in new markets as they could service demand from local inventory more readily than global brands. Once global vendor inventory returned to a more normal level purchasers often reverted to previous purchasing habits.

The general radiography market has experienced issues across the supply chain. Many components including steel and semiconductors are in short supply. Coupled with rising costs of transportation and limited availability of shipping average selling prices are expected to rise by approximately 8% in the short term for general radiography systems before stabilizing and declining again. This is also adding to lead times for projects with systems taking a lot longer to reach customers.

Fluoroscopy also returned to growth but demand is expected to become more specialized

Demand for fluoroscopy also returned to growth in 2021 with 18% year-on-year revenue growth to $509 million (500 million euros) reported up from $431 million (424 million euros) in 2020. However fewer fluoroscopic procedures are now being performed with other modalities like CT and MRI taking precedence for procedures traditionally conducted on fluoroscopy systems. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) and barium swallow procedures remain the most procedures maintaining clinical demand for fluoroscopy and will remain essential for the long-term health of this modality.

With fewer fluoroscopic exams being performed and increased focus on return of investment in purchasing decisions multipurpose systems are now even more desirable especially in North America and Western Europe.

Fluoroscopy revenues will surpass 2019 pre-COVID levels next year but growth will be limited after this as other imaging modalities continue to challenge fluoroscopy. The fluoroscopy market is set to reach $614 million (603 million euros) by 2026.

Key trends by region

North America

The U.S. continues to be one of the few countries still favoring classical fluoroscopy systems due to historical training practices concerns of patient movement threatening image quality and potential litigation. Demand is expected to gradually transition to remote systems as new generations of radiographers are trained on remote systems; classical is however still expected to be dominant in the next five years.

In the general radiography market demand for high-end features is increasing with tools to aid workflow becoming highly desirable for many imaging centers and hospitals.

Latin America

The Latin America market continues to be highly cost sensitive with options like computed radiography retrofit and analog systems remaining popular. For many end users there is a desire to digitalize but currently the price point remains prohibitive. For the digital solutions that are sold low-end systems with a lower price point are by far the preferred option -- over 50% of fixed and mobile solutions revenue came from the low-end in 2021.

Fluoroscopy remains a very small market in Latin America with the high price point proving a significant barrier for entry to this market. Brazil is the largest adopter of fluoroscopy in the region with most other Latin American countries seeing minimal sales.

Western Europe

High-end product continues to dominate the general radiography market in Western Europe with 68% of revenue for fixed-room product coming from high-end systems in 2021. Floor-mounted systems sell more in unit terms in Western Europe but with a lower average sales price; revenue from ceiling mounted solutions accounts for a higher proportion of the market.

Most Western Europe markets have limited demand for fluoroscopy with France being the key exception. Almost 30% of all revenue in Western Europe comes from this country. France is also unique in that many healthcare providers prefer to use dedicated fluoroscopy systems rather than multi-purpose which is generally utilized in the rest of Western Europe.

Eastern Europe Middle East and Africa (EEMEA)

Parts of EEMEA remain very cost-sensitive with Africa and less-developed countries in the Middle East seeing high adoption rates of computed radiography analog and retrofit systems. For many digital solutions are too costly especially with the added infrastructure costs to enable PACS and other healthcare IT solutions on top of the imaging systems. Servicing imaging equipment can also be a barrier to adoption with few engineers available locally to quickly fix broken systems.

Fluoroscopy remains very small for most of EEMEA. The areas that have stronger installed bases are in French-speaking north Africa where demand follows France. In parts of the Middle East such as in Saudi Arabia some trends follow the U.S. as some radiographers were trained in the States and therefore follow classical fluoroscopy installation practices.

Asia Pacific

Asia Pacific remains cost sensitive in many parts of the region with 57% of fixed room revenue coming from the low-end segments. In countries like India high levels of analog and computed radiography (CR) systems remain significant. In China CT imaging is increasingly preferred over high-end digital radiography.

Japan remains essential to the long-term growth of the fluoroscopy markets with 45% of all unit sales in the region coming from this country alone. Elsewhere demand is minimal with costs proving prohibitive to adoption.

Competitive landscape

A return to a more conventional vendor landscape was evident in 2021 with global brands such as Siemens Healthineers GE HealthCare and Philips regaining market share temporarily lost during the pandemic when demand outstripped the available supply. With these vendors able to fulfill demand smaller local vendors dropped share.

In the fixed DR market Siemens strengthened its position with a gain of 2.5 percentage points. For mobile DR GE reclaimed the top position as Carestream Health experienced a difficult year after a very strong 2020.

For the fluoroscopy market Siemens led with a very strong 2021 gaining further share. Shimadzu Medical Systems follows with strong sales in its domestic market.

Outlook

The fixed DR market will continue to recover. Budgets will continue to return for fixed-room installations and projects previously postponed will be able to restart. Additionally in some countries like the U.S. replacement cycles will stimulate further growth toward the end of the forecast. Globally ceiling-suspended fixed-room product revenue will grow at a faster pace (5% compound annual growth from 2021-2026) than floor-mounted systems (4% compound annual growth rate) especially in more developed markets where the desire for high-end features often found in ceiling-mounted solutions are increasingly required.

Low-end system demand will continue to be driven by cost-sensitive markets such as Latin America Africa the Middle East and parts of Asia. However the price of digital solutions will need to be significantly reduced to be an attainable option for these regions. Until the price falls sufficiently analog CR and retrofit systems will continue to play an important role.

Fluoroscopy systems will also see limited growth but will also come under increasing pressure from other modalities such as CT and endoscopy. At the end of the forecast low-single-digit annual revenue growth is predicted. In many countries and regions the demand for fluoroscopy will come predominantly from multipurpose systems; as fewer procedures are performed on the systems budget holders will want to minimize downtime by enabling other general radiography imaging.

It‚Äôs also a massive lineup with 347 models currently listed at Lenovo.com ranging from the $569 ThinkPad E15 (AMD) at the low end to the $4175 ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 5 at the high end.

The ThinkPad line is full of excellent machines many of which have shown up on our best business laptops list. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 for example is an excellent 14-inch business laptop that offers a sturdy thin and light chassis with solid performance and battery life. The ThinkPad X13s is a recent laptop that leverages Qualcomm‚Äôs Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 ARM CPU for great battery life in a diminutive chassis. The ThinkPad is known for its all-black chassis with red accents excellent keyboard touchpad and TrackPoint and solid business features.

Fortunately the ThinkPad line is broken up into easily digested pieces:

C Series: ThinkPads running Google‚Äôs Chrome OS specifically the $1019 Thinkpad C14 Chromebook Enterprise .

. L Series: These are entry-level business machines. Prices range from the $571 ThinkPad L13 Gen 3 (AMD) to the $2010 ThinkPad Yoga L13 Gen 3 with Intel inside.

to the $2010 with Intel inside. X Series: These are the smallest ThinkPads including machines like the ThinkPad X12 Detachable and the ThinkPad X13s.

T Series: With workhorse laptops with simpler designs and high performance the T Series has a wide range of machines starting with the $755 ThinkPad T14 Gen 2 up to the $3999 ThinkPad T15g .

up to the $3999 . Z Series: This is the newest ThinkPad line that‚Äôs aimed at sustainability via recyclable materials. The Z Series has two models the ThinkPad Z13 starting at $1355 and the ThinkPad Z16 starting at $1975.

starting at $1355 and the starting at $1975. E Series: As ThinkPad‚Äôs more affordable lineup it starts with the ThinkPad E15 Gen 4 (AMD) mentioned above which is the least expensive ThinkPad and ranges up to the $1000 ThinkPad E15 Gen 4 Intel version.

version. P Series: This is ThinkPad‚Äôs workstation lineup aimed at scientific engineering and creative users. The P Series utilizes the fastest Intel 12th-gen 45-watt Core CPUs like the Core i9-12900HX and professional-level GPUs like the Nvidia RTX A5500. The entry-level ThinkPad workstation is the ThinkPad P16s (AMD) at $1319 and the line tops out at the $5059 ThinkPad P1 Gen 5 .

(AMD) at $1319 and the line tops out at the $5059 . X1 Series: The ThinkPad‚Äôs ultra-premium lineup with both clamshell and 2-in-1 form factors has standout machines that include the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 mentioned above and the ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 7. ThinkPad X1 prices start at $949 for the ThinkPad X1 Tablet Gen 3 and max out at the $2513 ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 .

Navigating your way through the ThinkPad lineup can be a challenge but suffice it to say that if you do your research you‚Äôll find a business-class laptop that will accomplish every possible objective. There are few manufacturers that offer a business laptop lineup that‚Äôs so diverse.

ThinkBook

The ThinkBook line is Lenovo‚Äôs nod to the small business. It offers features that businesspeople will appreciate like solid build qualities privacy and security and innovative features. Speaking of the latter the ThinkBook platform hosts a couple of unique models in the ThinkBook Plus Gen 2 with an e-ink screen on the lid and the ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 with a large second screen to the right of the keyboard.

Otherwise ThinkBooks are well-designed laptops with top performance and battery life and outstanding connectivity. The line ranges in price from the $842 ThinkBook 15 Gen 4 to the $2609 ThinkBook Plus Gen 2. You can choose between Intel 12th-gen and AMD Ryzen 6000 CPUs and display options range from Full HD up to UHD+.

Most ThinkBook models are clamshell laptops but the line does include a couple of convertible 2-in-1s. The ThinkBook Plus Gen 2 is one of course and the other is the $1400 ThinkBook 14s Yoga Gen 2. If you‚Äôre a business person who wants the right business features but doesn‚Äôt need enterprise security and management then the ThinkBook line is a great option.

Legion

Finally Lenovo has its Legion line of gaming laptops. The company‚Äôs least expensive gaming machines fall in the IdeaPad line and so Legion starts at midrange and goes up from there. The line is a mix of conservatively designed thin and light gaming laptops and machines with more of a gaming aesthetic ‚Äî although Lenovo avoids creating the kind of extravagant designs as some other gaming laptop makers.

The entry-level is represented by the $1100 Legion 5 Gen 6 with an AMD Ryzen 5 CPU and RTX 3050 GPU which is equipped to run modern titles at 1080p and medium graphics. At the high end is the $4120 Legion 7i Gen 7 with an Intel Core i9-12900HX and an RTX 3080 Ti that‚Äôs more than capable of running games at 4K resolutions and high graphics.

Mixed in the lineup is the full range of Intel and AMD CPUs and Nvidia GPUs with displays sporting high refresh rates at 165Hz and higher. We‚Äôve found Lenovo‚Äôs Legion lineup of gaming laptops to be quite competitive with the rest of the field.

Fresh out of university this person had arrived late and then suggested they conduct the celebrity interview for the next issue. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing with these young ones coming through now‚Äù my colleague said with a solemn shake of their head ‚Äúthey just don‚Äôt want to put the graft in.‚Äù

Twelve years later and society is in a moment of transformation when it comes to work and our attitudes towards it. The Great Resignation ‚Äì or at least the Great Thinking About Resignation ‚Äì is upon us. The Covid pandemic smashed through many of the grand narratives we have passed down for generations about having a job: the need to be present in an office the idea we are somehow indispensable to the wider machine we are operating in.

For older people already in charge this meant scrambling to adjust the modern workplace to be more flexible and inclusive in the hope this would keep the young people in their organisations happy. But Generation Z already had other ideas. It‚Äôs not just that many of them entered the workplace in the era of Covid. It‚Äôs that they had already watched my generation ‚Äì the pitiful Millennials ‚Äì get sucked into a broken social contract the one that promised if you found a good job and worked hard you‚Äôd get ahead. They saw us stifled and infantilised by two recessions mired in existential despair about the housing crisis and now vulnerable again as the cost of living crisis asserts its grip.

I can wake up tomorrow and say: ‚ÄòYou know what I‚Äôm really not feeling great I can take this day off and chill‚Äô Adwoa Owusu-Darko

Gen Z stand up to their employers in a way no previous generation has something usually dismissed as a spoiled sense of entitlement. But in record numbers they are also mobilising to establish incomes that don‚Äôt rely on their elders. They‚Äôre drop shipping Amazon reselling flipping designer sneakers spread betting investing in crypto and NFTs. They‚Äôre inventing their own cosmetic lines for TikTok or selling homemade teeth grills on Instagram. They want to be famous on social media not just because it feels good but because they can monetise it in shrewd ways.

Some people call it a new golden age of entrepreneurialism others the rise of the side hustle. But at the core of Gen Z‚Äôs attitude to work is a desire as old as capitalism itself ‚Äì to be financially independent to opt out of old-fashioned ideas like having a boss altogether. All of which begs the question: is the problem that they have unrealistic expectations and don‚Äôt want to put the graft in? Or do they ‚Äì gulp ‚Äì know something we don‚Äôt?

In 2014 when Adwoa Owusu-Darko was 15 and working in a greetings card shop she‚Äôd buy new outfits rather than waste her wages on alcohol. ‚ÄúI wanted to look cool on non-uniform days‚Äù she says ‚Äúbut it wasn‚Äôt very practical. I was buying things I‚Äôd wear once or that were ill-fitting and not really me.‚Äù

Then in 2016 a friend mentioned she‚Äôd sold a pair of dungarees on an app called Depop a social e-commerce platform where people were offloading unwanted clothes. Inspired to clear some space Adwoa got out a camera.

‚ÄúI decided to model but I was uncomfortable showing my face‚Äù she says. The solution she came up with ‚Äì taking shots with the camera held in front of her face ‚Äì became her signature aesthetic different from the crumpled flatlays or limp coat-hanger shots elsewhere on the app. Soon Adwoa was being featured on Depop‚Äôs hallowed Explore page and at 18 her store Mini‚Äôs World was born.

Depop is a proudly young space with 90% of its active users under 26. It taps into many of the values cherished by Gen Z: sustainability authenticity and the chance to buy from influencers rather than faceless corporations. Adwoa was able to support herself through university without needing a conventional job. An appearance on Channel 4‚Äôs Supershoppers saw Mini‚Äôs World take off and now she has a second business as a consultant helping other Depop sellers get started.

In May this year Elite Business magazine published a report claiming that Gen Z entrepreneurs are leading the post-Covid recovery in the UK. It found that among the country‚Äôs sole traders those from Gen Z are the only age group to have experienced annual increases in revenue during the pandemic. Despite this one crucial distinction between Gen Z and previous generations may be how they measure success. After growing her business over lockdown Adwoa ‚Äì now 24 ‚Äì took the decision to press pause.

‚ÄúTowards the end of 2021 my mental health really suffered‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEven though I was doing well financially I decided to downscale. I think Gen Z put a lot of emphasis on wellbeing and mental health and being in an environment that really serves them. It is important to be mentally and financially stable and one should not cost the other.

‚ÄúI can wake up tomorrow and say: ‚ÄòYou know what I‚Äôm really not feeling great I can take this day off and chill.‚Äô Then the next day I can scale up and work from midnight to 5am if I want to. That is what gives me quality of life. That‚Äôs something to aspire to.‚Äù

Even prior to Covid a 2018 report from Reading Business School had declared this the ‚Äúage of the side hustle‚Äù claiming it generates ¬£72bn for the UK or about 3.6% of GDP. And 16 to 24-year-olds are leading the charge.

Scrolling through the TikTok hashtags of #hustle and #sidehustle where countless creators ‚Äì mostly young men ‚Äì post updates about their quest for financial freedom I came across Jack Calvert from Middlesbrough. He was discussing something called the Hustler‚Äôs University an online course currently at the centre of controversy and feverish debate: does it truly unlock the secrets to getting rich from your laptop or is it best avoided?

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been kind of obsessed with money‚Äù Jack 20 tells me. ‚ÄúWhen I was a kid I used to sell raffle tickets to my family and pick a random toy from my bedroom as the prize.‚Äù He also tried ‚Äì unsuccessfully ‚Äì to make money online from streaming his Fifa sessions on Twitch and YouTube

Then over lockdown Jack ‚Äì a year into an accountancy degree ‚Äì got interested in the murky world of affiliate marketing. He says the method he used involved building a mailing list of email addresses via social media then spamming them with other offers for various deals around the internet which in turn gave him a small referral fee should they make a purchase. Basically the next time you get an email from an unfamiliar account promising ‚ÄúAMAZING IPAD DEALS‚Äù it may well be a teenager in Teesside trying to launch their business empire.

Jack‚Äôs TikTok posts about passive income and affiliate marketing and various other digital buzzwords were averaging 400-500 views. In that time he says he made a total of ¬£700 profit. But when he started posting about Hustler‚Äôs University his views shot up with some reaching hundreds of thousands. Since then he has started regularly going on TikTok live streams fielding questions from other would-be hustlers curious to know whether they should pay ¬£39 a month to unlock Hustler‚Äôs University secrets.

So what are these secrets? Hustler‚Äôs University is an online academy that offers a series of lessons on things such as crypto investing drop shipping and copywriting. Information on these topics is not hard to track down for free online but what you get with Hustler‚Äôs University is an incentive to convince others to follow you: Jack like all members gets a 48% cut.

‚ÄúThe referrals were never the original goal they‚Äôre kind of a happy bonus‚Äù Jack insists and so far he says he is sticking to his word by giving people an honest account of the programme‚Äôs merits. ‚ÄúI try to give a fair reflection. I always say: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs working fine for me but it may not be worth it for you.‚Äô Obviously you do get a lot of people falsely promoting it and claiming it‚Äôs going to be better than it is which is quite scummy‚Äù says Jack. ‚ÄúThough the course itself tells you not to do that.‚Äù

It may well but one of the reasons Hustler‚Äôs University is so popular is that it is owned by Andrew Tate a 35-year-old former British-American kickboxer subject of an Observer investigation recently. Tate was ejected from Big Brother in 2016 after a video of him beating a woman came to light although they both denied any abuse occurred and claimed it was harmless consensual roleplay. He now uses his Instagram feed to post pictures of himself with supercars and piles of money while promising followers they can achieve the same lifestyle. Tate is currently TikTok catnip where he posts a seemingly endless line of controversial soundbites ranging from why depression doesn‚Äôt exist to the various reasons women should be subservient to men. Whether he is truly the epitome of toxic masculinity or just putting it on for views is a subject for debate but for many of the people giving him ¬£39 a month in the hope it‚Äôll make their wildest dreams come true it‚Äôs beside the point.

When we spoke after two months of spending an hour or two a day following the secrets of Hustler‚Äôs University Jack says he has made only ¬£2000. But he insists he is learning useful skills and will focus on video game design and fashion next.

If the tools Gen Z are using feel alien the qualities that make a truly successful entrepreneur perhaps haven‚Äôt changed all that much. Ben Towers started his business aged 11 helping one of his mum‚Äôs friends make a website.

It was 2010 and Ben was given ¬£50 for his efforts. Thrilled he took his new skillset and tapped into the-then burgeoning online freelance world helping more hapless boomers who wanted to keep pace with the digital age. He was so successful that his mother became nervous about the money he was making and insisted he hire a lawyer and an accountant.

‚ÄúEventually I started moving more into marketing because once these businesses had their website they then wanted to know how to get people to visit them.‚Äù By the time he was 14 he was subcontracting other remote freelancers to help him manage the workload alongside his school work. At 17 he quit school early employing himself as an apprentice to meet the criteria for doing so. By 18 he had scaled his business Towers Design to a team of 26. In 2017 he sold it in a merger that made him a millionaire.

Articulate modest and polite Ben now 24 is often used as a poster boy for Gen Z entrepreneurialism in the UK. Ironically for someone who never had much interest in joining a traditional workplace his new venture Tahora which he co-founded helps big businesses such as Google Natwest and the RSPCA make their workplaces more inclusive and appealing for younger workers.

My generation has been exposed to a level of information that society has never seen before Ben Towers

In a sense Ben is repeating the same trick that got him started at 11 by exploiting a knowledge gap between him and an older generation. In 2010 it was every business owner wanting a Facebook page; today it‚Äôs that they want help satisfying a generation of employees who demand more than a salary and paid holiday. Get your workplace culture wrong ‚Äì as a New York Times article from 2021 with the chilling title ‚ÄúThe 37-Year-Olds Are Afraid of the 23-Year-Olds Who Work for Them‚Äù pointed out ‚Äì and Gen Z will say: ‚ÄúActually we can leave and do whatever we want.‚Äù

Interestingly Ben attributes this appetite for independence among his generation not to their aptitude for the internet as much as the sense of panic it has helped instil in them. ‚ÄúMy generation has been exposed to a level of information that society has never seen before‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt used to be that you‚Äôd read a paper or sit down and watch the news once in the evening; now we open our phones 60 times a day. I think our experience of fake news has led us to just go: ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt trust the world I‚Äôm not gonna get any opportunities coming my way.‚Äô It‚Äôs a fight or flight idea: I‚Äôm gonna have to fight I‚Äôm gonna have to make my own money.‚Äù

Adwoa Jack and Ben all say they have benefited from relatively comfortable and supportive upbringings and that hustle culture can be dangerous for those who are less fortunate or just naive. ‚ÄúThe average entrepreneur earns less than the minimum wage‚Äù Ben warns. ‚ÄúThe vast majority do it because they love the challenge. For me that‚Äôs very different to people who are just desperate to have the entrepreneur lifestyle.‚Äù

Talking to young people who are finding their own ways through the traditional career path ‚Äì or just ignoring it altogether ‚Äì is inspiring but you also can‚Äôt help but feel angry on their behalf. I graduated during the 2007 recession but spent my childhood cocooned in the 90s; Gen Z grew up witnessing the harsh realities of austerity the housing crisis and spiralling personal debt ‚Äì and had to be the first to navigate social media as children.

Rather than be broken by all of this many have found creative ways to turn their digital nativism to their advantage and have embraced a concept we only pay lip service to ‚Äì work-life balance ‚Äì as a true ambition.

The more you see the world from Gen Z‚Äôs perspective the more you realise how ridiculous it is to expect them to tackle the challenges we left behind by working tirelessly and without complaint for one corporation or another hoping it‚Äôll all be OK. They‚Äôre far too shrewd too determined too hopeful for that. Maybe we should be taking notes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9iZXN0LW52aWRpYS1ncHUtb2YtYWxsLXRpbWUv0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5kcy5jb20vY29tcHV0aW5nL2Jlc3QtbnZpZGlhLWdwdS1vZi1hbGwtdGltZS8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 6 best Nvidia GPUs of all time,"Nvidia sets the standard so high for its gaming graphics cards that it‚Äôs actually hard to tell the difference between an Nvidia GPU that‚Äôs merely a winner and an Nvidia GPU that‚Äôs really special.

Nvidia has long been the dominant player in the graphics card market but the company has from time to time been put under serious pressure by its main rival AMD which has launched several of its own iconic GPUs. Those only set Nvidia up for a major comeback however and sometimes that led to a real game-changing card.

It was hard to choose which Nvidia GPUs were truly worthy of being called the best of all time but I‚Äôve narrowed down the list to six cards that were truly important and made history.

GeForce 256

The very first

Although Nvidia often claims the GeForce 256 was the world‚Äôs first GPU that‚Äôs only true if Nvidia is the only company that gets to define what a GPU is. Before GeForce there were the RIVA series of graphics cards and there were other companies making their own competing graphics cards then too. What Nvidia really invented was the marketing of graphics cards as GPUs because in 1999 when the 256 came out terms like graphics card and graphics chipset were more common.

Nvidia is right that the 256 was important however. Before the 256 the CPU played a very important role in rendering graphics to the point where the CPU was directly completing steps in rendering a 3D environment. However CPUs were not very efficient at doing this which is where the 256 came in with hardware transforming and lighting offloading the two most CPU intensive parts of rendering onto the GPU. This is one of the primary reasons why Nvidia claims this is the first GPU.

As a product the GeForce 256 wasn‚Äôt exactly legendary: Anandtech wasn‚Äôt super impressed by its price for the performance at the time of its release. Part of the problem was the 256‚Äôs memory which was single data rate or SDR. Due to other advances SDR was becoming insufficient for GPUs of this performance level. A faster dual data rate or DDR (the same DDR as in DDR5) launched just before the end of 1999 which finally met Anandtech‚Äôs expectations for performance but the increased price tag of the DDR version was hard to swallow.

The GeForce 256 first of its name is certainly historical but not because it was an amazing product. The 256 is important because it inaugurated the modern era of GPUs. The graphics card market wasn‚Äôt always a duopoly; back in the 90s there were multiple companies competing against each other with Nvidia being just one of them. Soon after the GeForce 256 launched most of Nvidia‚Äôs rivals exited the market. 3dfx‚Äôs Voodoo 5 GPUs were uncompetitive and before it went bankrupt many of its technologies were bought by Nvidia; Matrox simply quit gaming GPUs altogether to focus on professional graphics.

By the end of 2000 the only other graphics company in town was ATI. When AMD acquired ATI in 2006 it brought about the modern Nvidia and AMD rivalry we all know today.

GeForce 8800 GTX

A monumental leap forward

After the GeForce 256 Nvidia and ATI attempted to best the other with newer GPUs with higher performance. In 2002 however ATI threw down the gauntlet by launching its Radeon 9000 series and at a die size of 200mm squared the flagship Radeon 9800 XT was easily the largest GPU ever. Nvidia‚Äôs flagship GeForce4 Ti 4600 at 100mm had no hope of beating even the midrange 9700 Pro which inflicted a crushing defeat on Nvidia. Making a GPU was no longer just about the architecture the memory or the drivers; in order to win Nvidia would need to make big GPUs like ATI.

For the next four years the size of flagship GPUs continued to increase and by 2005 both companies had launched a GPU that was around 300mm. Although Nvidia had regained the upper hand during this time ATI was never far behind and its Radeon X1000 series was fairly competitive. A GPU sized at 300mm was far from the limit of what Nvidia could do however. In 2006 Nvidia released its GeForce 8 series led by the flagship 8800 GTX. Its GPU codenamed G80 was nearly 500mm and its transistor count was almost three times higher than the last GeForce flagship.

The 8800 GTX did to ATI what the Radeon 9700 Pro and the rest of the 9000 series did to Nvidia with Anandtech describing the moment as ‚Äú9700 Pro-like.‚Äù A single 8800 GTX was almost twice as fast as ATI‚Äôs top-end X1950 XTX not to mention much more efficient. At $599 the 8800 GTX was more expensive than its predecessors but its high level of performance and DirectX 10 support made up for it.

But this was mostly the end of the big GPU arms race that had characterized the early 2000s for two main reasons. Firstly 500mm was getting pretty close to the limit of how large a GPU could be and even today 500mm is relatively big for a processor. Even if Nvidia wanted to making a bigger GPU just wasn‚Äôt feasible. Secondly ATI wasn‚Äôt working on its own 500mm GPU anyway so Nvidia wasn‚Äôt in a rush to get an even bigger GPU to market. Nvidia had basically won the arms race by outspending ATI.

That year also saw the acquisition of ATI by AMD which was finalized just before the 8800 GTX launched. Although ATI now had the backing of AMD it really seemed like Nvidia had such a massive lead that Radeon wouldn‚Äôt challenge GeForce for a long time perhaps never again.

GeForce GTX 680

Beating AMD at its own game

Nvidia‚Äôs next landmark release came in 2008 when it launched the GTX 200 series starting with the GTX 280 and GTX 260. At nearly 600mm squared the 280 was a worthy monstrous successor to the 8800 GTX. Meanwhile AMD and ATI signaled that they would no longer be launching high-end GPUs with big dies in order to compete rather focusing on making smaller GPUs in a gambit known as the small die strategy. In its review Anandtech said ‚ÄúNvidia will be left all alone with top performance for the foreseeable future.‚Äù As it turned out the next four years were pretty rough for Nvidia.

Starting with the HD 4000 series in 2008 AMD assaulted Nvidia with small GPUs that had high value and almost flagship levels of performance and that dynamic was maintained throughout the next few generations. Nvidia‚Äôs GTX 280 wasn‚Äôt cost effective enough then the GTX 400 series was delayed and the 500 series was too hot and power hungry.

One of Nvidia‚Äôs traditional weaknesses was its disadvantage when it came to process the way processors are manufactured. Nvidia was usually behind AMD but it had finally caught up by using the 40nm node for the 400 series. AMD however wanted to regain the process lead quickly and decided its next generation would be on the new 28nm node and Nvidia decided to follow suit.

AMD won the race to 28nm with its HD 7000 series with its flagship HD 7970 putting AMD back in first place for performance. However the GTX 680 launched just two months later and not only did it beat the 7970 in performance but also power efficiency and even die size. As Anandtech put it Nvidia had ‚Äúlanded the technical trifecta‚Äù and that completely flipped the tables on AMD. AMD did reclaim the performance crown yet again by launching the HD 7970 GHz Edition later in 2012 (notable for being the first 1GHz GPU) but having the lead in efficiency and performance per millimeter was a good sign for Nvidia.

The back and forth battle between Nvidia and AMD was pretty exciting after how disappointing the GTX 400 and 500 series had been and while the 680 wasn‚Äôt an 8800 GTX it signaled Nvidia‚Äôs return to being truly competitive against AMD. Perhaps most importantly Nvidia was no longer weighed down by its traditional process disadvantage and that would eventually pay off in a big way.

GeForce GTX 980

Nvidia‚Äôs dominance begins

Nvidia found itself in a very good spot with the GTX 600 series and it was because of TSMC‚Äôs 28nm process. Under normal circumstances AMD would have simply gone to TSMC‚Äôs next process in order to regain its traditional advantage but this was no longer an option. TSMC and all other foundries in the world (except for Intel) had an extraordinary amount of difficulty progressing beyond the 28nm node. New technologies were needed in order to progress further which meant Nvidia didn‚Äôt have to worry about AMD regaining the process lead any time soon.

Following a few years of back and forth and AMD floundering with limited funds Nvidia launched the GTX 900 series in 2014 inaugurated by the GTX 980. Based on the new Maxwell architecture it was an incredible improvement over the GTX 600 and 700 series despite being on the same node. The 980 was between 30% and 40% faster than the 780 while consuming less power and it was even a smidge faster than the top-end 780 Ti. Of course the 980 also beat the R9 290X once again landing the trifecta of performance power efficiency and die size. In its review Anandtech said the 980 came ‚Äúvery very close to doing to the Radeon 290X what the GTX 680 did to Radeon HD 7970.‚Äù

AMD was incapable of responding. It didn‚Äôt have a next-generation GPU ready to launch in 2014. In fact AMD wasn‚Äôt even working on a complete lineup of brand-new GPUs to even the score with Nvidia. AMD instead was planning on rebranding the Radeon 200 series as the Radeon 300 series and would develop one new GPU to serve as the flagship. All of these GPUs were to launch in mid 2015 giving the entire GPU market to Nvidia for nearly a full year. Of course Nvidia wanted to pull the rug right from under AMD and prepared a brand-new flagship.

Launching in mid 2015 the GTX 980 Ti was about 30% faster than the GTX 980 thanks to its significantly higher power consumption and larger die size at just over 600mm squared. It beat AMD‚Äôs brand-new R9 Fury X a month before it even launched. Although the Fury X wasn‚Äôt bad it had lower performance than the 980 Ti higher power consumption and much less VRAM. It was a demonstration of how far ahead Nvidia was with the 900 series; while AMD was hastily trying to get the Fury X out the door Nvidia could have launched the 980 Ti any time it wanted.

Anandtech put it pretty well: ‚ÄúThe fact that they get so close only to be outmaneuvered by Nvidia once again makes the current situation all the more painful; it‚Äôs one thing to lose to Nvidia by feet but to lose by inches only reminds you of just how close they got how they almost upset Nvidia.‚Äù

Nvidia was basically a year ahead of AMD technologically and while what they had done with the GTX 900 series was impressive it was also a bit depressing. People wanted to see Nvidia and AMD duke it out like they had done in 2012 and 2013 but it started to look like that was all in the past. Nvidia‚Äôs next GPU would certainly reaffirm that feeling.

GeForce GTX 1080

The GPU with no competition but itself

In 2015 TSMC had finally completed the 16nm process which could achieve 40% higher clock speeds than 28nm at the same power or half the power of 28nm at similar clock speeds. However Nvidia planned to move to 16nm in 2016 when the node was more mature. Meanwhile AMD had absolutely no plans to utilize TSMC‚Äôs 16nm but instead moved to launch new GPUs and CPUs on GlobalFoundries‚Äôs 14nm process. But don‚Äôt be fooled by the names: TSMC‚Äôs 16nm was and is better than GlobalFoundries‚Äôs 14nm. After 28nm nomenclature for processes became based in marketing rather than scientific measurements. This meant that for the first time in modern GPU history Nvidia had the process advantage against AMD.

The GTX 10-series launched in mid-2016 based on the new Pascal architecture and TSMC‚Äôs 16nm node. Pascal wasn‚Äôt actually very different from Maxwell but the jump from 28nm to 16nm was massive like Intel going from 14nm on Skylake to 10nm on Alder Lake. The GTX 1080 was the new flagship and it‚Äôs hard to overstate how fast it was. The GTX 980 was a little faster than the GTX 780 Ti when it came out. By contrast the GTX 1080 was over 30% faster than the GTX 980 Ti and for $50 less too. The die size of the 1080 was also extremely impressive at just over 300mm squared nearly half the size of the 980 Ti.

With the 1080 and the rest of the 10-series lineup Nvidia effectively took the entire desktop GPU market for itself. AMD‚Äôs 300 series and the Fury X were simply no match. At the midrange AMD launched the RX 400 series but these were just three low to mid-range GPUs that were a throwback to the small die strategy minus the part where Nvidia‚Äôs flagship was in striking distance like with the GTX 280 and the HD 4870. In fact the 1080 was nearly twice as fast as the RX 480. The only GPU AMD could really beat was the mid-range GTX 1060 as the slightly cut down GTX 1070 was just a little too fast to lose to the Fury X.

AMD did eventually launch new high-end GPUs in the form of RX Vega a full year after the 1080 came out. With much higher power consumption and the same selling price the flagship RX Vega 64 beat the GTX 1080 by a hair but wasn‚Äôt very competitive. However the GTX 1080 was no longer Nvidia‚Äôs flagship; with relatively small die size and a full year to prepare Nvidia launched a brand-new flagship a whole three months before RX Vega even launched; it was a repeat of the 980 Ti. The new GTX 1080 Ti was even faster than the GTX 1080 delivering yet another 30% improvement to performance. As Anandtech put it the 1080 Ti ‚Äúfurther solidifie[d] Nvidia‚Äôs dominance of the high-end video card market.‚Äù

AMD‚Äôs failure to deliver a truly competitive high-end GPU meant that the 1080‚Äôs only real competition was Nvidia‚Äôs own GTX 1080 Ti. With the 1080 and the 1080 Ti Nvidia achieved what is perhaps the most complete victory we‚Äôve seen so far in modern GPU history. Over the past 4 years Nvidia kept increasing its technological advantage over AMD and it was hard to see how Nvidia could ever lose.

GeForce RTX 3080

Correcting course

After such a long and incredible streak of wins perhaps it was inevitable that Nvidia would succumb to hubris and lose sight of what made Nvidia‚Äôs great GPUs so great. Nvidia did not follow up the GTX 10 series with yet another GPU with a stunning increase in performance but with the infamous RTX 20 series. Perhaps in a move to cut AMD out of the GPU market Nvidia focused on introducing hardware accelerated ray tracing and A.I. upscaling instead of delivering better performance in general. If successful Nvidia could make AMD GPUs irrelevant until the company finally made Radeon GPUs with built-in ray tracing.

RTX 20-series was a bit of a flop. When the RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti launched in late 2018 there weren‚Äôt even any games that supported ray tracing or deep learning super sampling (DLSS). But Nvidia priced RTX 20-series cards as if those features made all the difference. At $699 the 2080 had a nonsensical price and the 2080 Ti‚Äôs $1199 price tag was even more insane. Nvidia wasn‚Äôt even competing with itself anymore.

The performance improvement in existing titles was extremely disappointing too; the RTX 2080 was only 11% faster than the GTX 1080 though at least the RTX 2080 Ti was around 30% faster than the GTX 1080 Ti.

The next two years were a course correction for Nvidia. The threat from AMD was starting to become pretty serious; the company had finally regained the process advantage by moving to TSMC‚Äôs 7nm and the company launched the RX 5700 XT in mid-2019. Nvidia was able to head it off once again by launching new GPUs this time the RTX 20 Super series with a focus on value but the 5700 XT must have worried Nvidia. The RTX 2080 Ti was three times as large yet was only 50% faster meaning AMD was achieving much higher performance per millimeter. If AMD made a larger GPU it could be difficult to beat.

Both Nvidia and AMD planned for a big showdown in 2020. Nvidia recognized AMD‚Äôs potential and pulled out all the stops: the new 8nm process from Samsung the new Ampere architecture and an emphasis on big GPUs. AMD meanwhile stayed on TSMC‚Äôs 7nm process but introduced the new RDNA 2 architecture and would also be launching a big GPU its first since RX Vega in 2017. The last time both companies launched brand-new flagships within the same year was 2013 nearly a decade ago. Though the pandemic threatened to ruin the plans of both companies neither company was willing to delay the next generation and launched as planned.

Nvidia fired first with the RTX 30-series led by the flagship RTX 3090 but most of the focus was on the RTX 3080 since at $699 it was far more affordable than the $1499 3090. Instead of being a repeat of the RTX 20-series the 3080 delivered a sizeable 30% bump in performance at 4K over the RTX 2080 Ti though the power consumption was a little high. At lower resolutions the performance gain of the 3080 was somewhat less but since the 3080 was very capable at 4K it was easy to overlook this. The 3080 also benefitted from a wider variety of games supporting ray tracing and DLSS giving value to having an Nvidia GPU with those features.

Of course this wouldn‚Äôt matter if the 3080 and the rest of the RTX 30-series couldn‚Äôt stand up to AMD‚Äôs new RX 6000 series which launched two months later. At $649 the RX 6800 XT was AMD‚Äôs answer to the RTX 3080. With nearly identical performance in most games and at most resolutions the battle between the 3080 and the 6800 XT was reminiscent of the GTX 680 and the HD 7970. Each company had its advantages and disadvantages with AMD leading in power efficiency and performance while Nvidia had better performance in ray tracing and support for other features like A.I. upscaling.

The excitement over a new episode in the GPU war quickly died out though because it quickly came apparent that nobody could buy RTX 30 or RX 6000 or even any GPUs at all. The pandemic had seriously reduced supply while crypto increased demand and scalpers snatched up as many GPUs as they could. At the time of writing the shortage has mostly ended but most Nvidia GPUs are still selling for usually $100 or more over MSRP. Thankfully higher-end GPUs like the RTX 3080 can be found closer to MSRP than lower-end 30 series cards which keeps the 3080 a viable option.

On the whole the RTX 3080 was a much-needed correction from Nvidia. Although the 3080 has marked the end of Nvidia‚Äôs near total domination of the desktop GPU market it‚Äôs hard not to give the company credit for not losing to AMD. After all the RX 6000 series is on a much better process and AMD has been extremely aggressive these past few years. And besides it‚Äôs good to finally see a close race between Nvidia and AMD where both sides are trying really hard to win.

So what‚Äôs next?

Unlike AMD Nvidia always keeps its cards close to its chest and rarely ever reveals information on upcoming products. We can be pretty confident the upcoming RTX 40 series will launch sometime this year but everything else is uncertain. One of the more interesting rumors is that Nvidia will utilize TSMC‚Äôs 5nm for RTX 40 GPUs and if this is true then that means Nvidia will have parity with AMD once again.

But I think that as long as RTX 40 isn‚Äôt another RTX 20 and provides more low-end and mid-range options than RTX 30 Nvidia should have a good enough product next generation. I would really like for it to be so good that it makes the list of best Nvidia GPUs of all time but we‚Äôll have to wait and see.

Text Ione Gamble

This article is part of our Future of Sex season ‚Äì a series of features investigating the future of sex relationships dating sex work and sex worker rights; tech; taboos; and the next socio-political sexual frontiers. Cast your mind back ten years ago. Instagram was in its infancy; Facebook wasn‚Äôt just for boomers; and algorithms were non-existent. In the early 2010s social media was largely unregulated with personal branding not yet a universal plight and our selfie-editing skills only as sophisticated as Instagram‚Äôs built-in filters. More crucially a decade ago social media was full of nudity and even more sex. Every Tuesday for example women on Tumblr would pose nude for ‚Äòtopless Tuesdays‚Äô ‚Äì the social-blogging platform was a space where self-shot nudes could rack up thousands of likes porn was littered all over our feeds but also where sex education resources could be shared freely.

Coming of age online in the mid to late 00s felt like growing up in the wild west; anything we didn‚Äôt learn at school was available at the click of a mouse button and your every sexual whim could be catered for without logging onto Pornhub. With this surge of sex-adjacent content gaining traction alongside fourth-wave feminism sex positivity worked its way into our socio-political lexicon. Slut-shaming rightfully became a sin as online conversations led to slut-walk protests in which women refused to have their sex lives used against them; we finally started talking about the orgasm gap; and there were around 10000 different iterations of hyper-realistic labia illustrations. Seeing all of this change happen through our computer screens felt transformative; no matter how restricted we felt in terms of sexual openness in our personal lives online it was an entirely open free and non-judgemental world. Eventually online discourse permeated beyond the URL world with my generation far more open to discuss sex and our bodies without fear of recourse. ‚ÄúWhere we once used to be free to an almost troubling degree it now seems impossible to breathe on social media without the threat of having your account deleted for violating guidelines‚Äù For all the awareness this mass exposure brought millennials it left millions of young people vulnerable. No matter how you slice it having teenagers post topless photos weekly en masse is troubling at best and exploitative at worst. The early age of social media came with little to no safeguarding. Before Instagram banned ‚Äòfemale‚Äô nipples policing what you posted online was your problem alone leaving thousands of us publishing content we would later come to regret. Now the internet is a very different place. Despite the well-meaning plights of Free the Nipple campaigns understandable fury from the heavily censored online community of sex workers and shadow-banning discourse we‚Äôre no longer allowed to pose naked on social media. More and more of our content is being censored. Since the no man‚Äôs land of Tumblr social media companies have scrambled to keep their users safe by introducing blanket bans on specific content and implementing algorithmic deletion triggers that fail to grasp the nuance of how we interact with each other online. It doesn‚Äôt matter if your bikini selfie was posted with sexual intent or not; it‚Äôs likely that if you‚Äôre not skinny cis and white Instagram will delete it. Where we once used to be free to an almost troubling degree it now seems impossible to breathe on social media without the threat of having your account deleted for violating guidelines.

With TikTok taking the lead as the social network du jour a whole new host of censorship norms are gaining prominence in online spaces. Not only can you no longer explicitly post sexual imagery but you also can‚Äôt even talk about it. On our For You pages creators can be found changing sex for ‚Äòseggs‚Äô starring out swearwords and point blank refusing to use any kind of sexually suggestive language for fear of being banned from the platform. OnlyFans creators are forced to jump through multiple hoops in order to even post their page links and sex educators are forced to use ridiculous euphemisms and code words in order to spread vital information that still ten years on from Tumblr‚Äôs peak isn‚Äôt available in the school system. As it becomes more and more difficult to not only discuss sex but even swear or use queer-specific slang on social media a sex-positivity backlash is emerging among Gen Z. Labelled as ‚Äòpuriteens‚Äô studies have found that 15 per cent of Gen Z are sexually inactive compared with just 6 per cent of Gen X‚Äôers saying the same. These statistics are echoed in the way young people express opinions online; with it becoming more popular to believe that sex positivity is in fact an agent of the patriarchy. In their minds engaging in sex seems to present more negatives than positives; and with revenge porn painful sex and cyber flashing so prevalent in society it‚Äôs not a stretch to see why. While it may be easy to attribute an increase in ‚Äòsex negativity‚Äô discourse online to the more visible social changes taking place like the rise in popularity of becoming a ‚Äòtrad wife‚Äô the fact a portion of Gen Z seem to hate sex scenes or the never-ending discourse surrounding whether kink should be banned at Pride; the root of our distaste for risqu√© content is less provocative. Our attitudes towards sex are changing but it‚Äôs not a product of the ‚Äòculture wars‚Äô; it‚Äôs because we can no longer speak about our desires freely. ‚ÄúWithout the tools for young people to discuss sex freely with their peers sex only has the space to be good or bad with none of the messy or complicated grey areas‚Äù"

August 2022 saw the appearance of a new gate guard at Trapani‚ÄìBirgi Airport which is a military air base and public airport in Sicily Italy. The gate guard in question is a General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcon with Matricola Militare (military registration) MM7240 (msn M22-5/61-403).

It is painted in a special '18¬∞ Gruppo Green Lightning' colour scheme which found its origin in 2009. On 8 June 2009 Major Maurizio ‚ÄúMasa‚Äù De Angelis commander of the Trapani Air Base based 18¬∞ Gruppo celebrated his 1000 flight hours on the F-16.

This particular General Dynamics F-16 was part of the of 34 F-16 fighter jets provided to the Aeronautica Militare (ItAF Italian Air Force) under a programme known as Peace Caesar with the first deliveries in 2003. The Aeronautica Militare chose the leased F-16 option as the most cost-effective solution to replace its aging fleet of Panavia Tornado and Lockheed F-104 Starfighters. Also four non-flyable F-16s were supplied for generation of spare parts.

F-16A MM7240 saw an extensive life with quite an interesting history. Built by General Dynamics as 81-0722 in its Forth Worth plant (TX) it was delivered on 12 November 1982 to the United States Air Force. It served with various units including the Air National Guard.

Most European spotters will remember the Viper as '81-0722/HR' flying from roughly November 1982 to April 1986 with the United States Air Force Europe 50th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hahn Air Force Base in Germany.

After a total refurbishment at Hill AFB (UT) it was delivered in 2004 to the Aeronautica Militare flying with the 18¬∞ Gruppo at Trapani-Birgi. After June 2011 it was put in storage only to be revealed right now in these colours.

Basic model

The continuous time extended Kermack and McKendrik SIRS (S=susceptibles I=infected & infectious R=recovered) epidemic model [537] is foundational to the development of epidemiological systems modeling and theory [38]. It is most often formulated in terms of the variables S I and R (note we use the roman font mnemonics S I and R to refer to the names of the disease classes/compartments and italic fonts to the variables themselves). For the sake of completeness we include a disease class D to account for the dead but define the number of individuals alive at time t to be

$$N(t)=S(t)+I(t)+R(t) \quad N(0)=N_{0}$$ (4)

In the context of differential equation models these variables strictly speaking should be interpreted as population density variables; though loosely speaking we think of them in terms of numbers in a closed (no births or natural deaths no migration) homogeneous population (everyone is equally susceptible infectious and likely to make contact with any other individual). From the general systems description given by Eq. 1 if the flow of individuals from disease classes/compartments S to I I to R and R back to S plus a flow of individuals from I to D (disease-induced mortality process) are respectively represented by the per capita flow rates œÅ SI  œÅ IR  œÅ RS  and œÅ ID  (solid arrows in Fig. 1) then we obtain the deterministic continuous-time epidemic compartmental SIRS model

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{SIRS+D cont.-time deterministic model}} \\ \frac{dS}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{RS}} R - \rho_{\text{SI}}S \quad S(0)=N_{0}-1 \\ \frac{dI}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{SI}} S - \rho_{\text{IR}} I - \rho_{\text{ID}} I \quad I(0)=1 \\ \frac{dR}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{IR}} I - \rho_{\text{RS}} R \quad R(0)=0 \\ D(t) & = & \int_{0}^{t} \rho_{\text{ID}} I(t) dt \end{array}$$ (5)

We note the initial conditions included here reflect the start of an epidemic caused by a novel pathogen (and variables though actually continuous are interpreted in terms of numbers of individuals). Other initial conditions can be assumed when using Eq. 5 to simulate a population that is already part way into an epidemic.

In practice once the values or functional forms of the flows œÅ XY have been specified for X Y = S I and R solutions will be generated over the time interval [0t fnl ] using numerical simulation techniques.

Constant flow rates

In the simplest case apart from the per capita susceptible flow rate œÅ SI  the flows are assumed to be constant and the transfer of individuals from one disease state to another follows an exponential process. The consequences of this assumption are discussed in Table 1.

Extra information. The assumption of a constant flow through X resulting in an exponential exit rate for all members currently in X is unrealistic. To see this consider any particular individual entering X at time t=0. The probability this individual leaves X during the interval [tt+1] is given by (recall Eq. 1.1 in Table 1)

$$\int_{t}^{t+1} f(t;\rho)= e^{-\rho t}-e^{-\rho (t+1)}$$ (6)

This probability has a maximum value of 1‚àíeœÅ at t=0. If individuals spend several units of time in X it is much more reasonable to assume that the probability they leave X in any particular unit of time is around the mean time \(\bar T^{\mathrm {X}}=\frac {1}{\rho }\) spent in X rather than the very first period of time. One can achieve this more reasonable departure behavior in a continuous-time differential equation model by dividing the disease class X into a say K>1 sub-compartments and have an individual pass through each of these sub-compartments at a rate KœÅ resulting in so-called box car models (Appendix B SOF). The exit process from a box-car model with K compartments is by an Erlang distribution with shape parameter K and scale parameter KœÅ rather than and Exponential distribution with scale parameter œÅ. In an Erlang distribution for which K>1 an individual is most likely to leave during the period that surrounds the mean time that it spends in X which is still \(\bar T^{\mathrm {X}}=\frac {1}{\rho }\) rather than immediately on entering as implied by Eq. 6 for the exponential case. The box car or Erlang model is described in more detail in Appendix B (SOF).

Disease transmission

The per capita flow rate œÅ SI from the susceptible to the infectious class is more complicated than the per capita flow rates between the other disease classes. This flow rate represents a disease transmission process that depends on susceptible and infectious individuals making contact with one another. This contact process in the original Kermack-McKendrick model was assumed to be dependent on the product S(t)I(t) of the susceptible and infectious classes. This approach draws its inspiration from the Law of Mass Action that pertains to chemical kinetics. The resulting incidence‚Äîthe rate of new infections‚Äîthen takes on the eponymous Œ≤SI transmission rate where Œ≤ is a parameter whose value reflects the joint effects of both an underlying contact rate and a ‚Äòprobability of transmission‚Äô per contact (inverted commas are used because only in the stochastic model as developed in ‚ÄúSIRS discrete and stochastic formulations‚Äù section are probabilities made explicit; also see ‚ÄúThe basic reproductive rate r-zero and probability of infection‚Äù section on how to derive the probability of transmission per contact). A more appropriate approach to modeling disease transmissions and hence the incidence rate in humans (at all but the very lowest population densities found in rural areas) is to assume that: 1.) each individual in the population contacts others at a per capita rate Œ∫; and 2.) only the proportion of contacts with infectious individuals‚Äîi.e. I(t)/N(t)‚Äîcan lead to transmission. Further not every contact will lead to transmission but will be scaled according to a force of infection parameter Œ≤. In this case we typically represent transmission by a per capita susceptible function that has the frequency dependent form [39]

$$\rho_{\text{SI}}=\kappa \beta \frac{I(t)}{N(t)}$$ (7)

In this case total incidence which we denote by Œî+I(t) (Œî+ is used to denote change due to new additions to I before accounting for the individuals that leave I) is now given the function

$${\text{Incidence:}} \qquad \qquad \Delta^{+} I(t) = \rho_{\text{SI}}S(t)=\kappa \beta \frac{S(t)I(t)}{N(t)}$$ (8)

More elaborate incidence functions have been proposed [40] particularly in the disease ecology literature [41]. Equation 7 however is the one we will focus on throughout this exposition. Also in most of the literature the processes of contact represented by the parameter Œ∫ and force of transmission per contact represented by the parameter Œ≤ are not separated but are effectively rolled into a single constant Œ≤ Œ∫ =Œ∫√óŒ≤ with no subscript used (equivalent to setting Œ∫=1). In this case the contact process itself is no longer transparent. We believe that the contact process should always be explicit as a reminder that transmission requires ‚Äòeffective contacts‚Äô to be made. Note that it does not make SIR models dynamically more complex when Œ≤ Œ∫ is represented as the product of two constants: i.e. when Œ≤ Œ∫ =Œ∫√óŒ≤. An effective contact is one that result in pathogen transmission. Contacts that do not result in transmission are part of more complex epidemic models that consider quarantining as a mitigation strategy [7] because not all quarantined individuals become infected.

Constant and adaptive contact rates

Most SIR models implicitly assume a constant contact rate

$${\text{Constant contact:}} \qquad \qquad \kappa(t)=\kappa_{0} \quad \text{for all } t\in[0t_{\text{fnl}}]$$ (9)

Arguably one of the most important modifications to the transmission rate and incidence expressions given by Eqs. 7 and 8 is to account for changes in contact rates once a pandemic has started. This behavior was seen with regards to the Ebola pandemic of 2015 [36] as well as COVID-19 pandemic [7]. One way to deal with this is to assume the contact rate adapts by decreasing either as a function of incidence (Eq. 8) or the proportion of individuals that are infectious (i.e. I(t)/N(t)). If we assume the latter then a three parameter form for the contact rate Œ∫(t) that depends on a basic contact rate Œ∫ 0 >0 an infectious proportion switching point P Œ∫ ‚àà(01) and an abruptness switching parameter œÉ Œ∫ ‚â•0 is given by the function [8]:

$${\text{Adaptive contact:}} \qquad \qquad \kappa(t)=\frac{\kappa_{0}}{1+\left(\frac{I(t)}{N(t)}/P_{\kappa}\right)^{\sigma_{\kappa}}}$$ (10)

The switching point parameter œÉ Œ∫ may be set to 2 for gradual switching 5 for relatively abrupt switching or 20 to approximate a step function around the infectious proportion switching point P Œ∫ .

The basic reproductive rate r-zero and probability of infection

The basic reproductive rate R 0  of a disease at the start of an epidemic in a population that has never been exposed to the pathogen causing the outbreak represents the number of expected new cases that the index case (aka patient zero) will cause. This number is represented by

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} R_{0} & = & \text{contact rate} \times \text{force of transmission per contact} \times \text{infectious period} \\ & = & \kappa \times \beta \times \frac{1}{\rho_{\text{IR}}} \ = \ \frac{\kappa\beta}{\rho_{\text{IR}}} \end{array}$$ (11)

The product Œ∫Œ≤ can be used to obtain the incidence per susceptible over a short time interval Œît at the start of the epidemic (also interpreted as the probability of a susceptible becoming infected over [01]) by solving for the incidence over the period t‚àà[0Œît] assuming I 0 =1. This number can be obtained by first solving the differential equation

$$\frac{dS}{dt}= - \kappa \beta I_{0} S \qquad \text{i.e. } I(t)=I_{0} \text{ treated as constant for } t \in [0\Delta t]$$

Integrating the above equation for the condition I 0 =1 (to see how many susceptibles are infected by a single inectious individual; and assuming both Œ∫ and Œ≤ constant over this interval) implies that S(Œît)=e‚àíŒ∫Œ≤ŒîtS 0 . Since the expected proportion of susceptibles that will become infected over [0Œît] (i.e. those that leave class S for class I) is given by \(p_{\text {inf}}=\frac {S(0)-S(\Delta t)}{S(0)}\) (also interpreted as the initial probability of infection) we obtain the expression

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{Probability of infection per contact on } [0\Delta t]} \\ p_{\text{infect}}(0\Delta t) & = &\left(1-e^{-\kappa \beta \Delta t}\right) \quad \text{for small } \Delta t \end{array}$$ (12)

Finally we reiterate that most SIRS formulations do not explicitly identify a contact rate Œ∫ so that this parameter does not appear at all in these formulations and also that Œ≥ is used instead of œÅ IR (Œ≥‚â°œÅ IR ). In such cases R 0 =Œ≤/Œ≥ and p infect (0Œît)=(1‚àíe‚àíŒ≤Œît). But as previously mentioned it is useful to explicitly include Œ∫ because it is needed to discuss adaptive contact and provide the structure needed to introduce quarantine rates in a sensible way.

SIRS discrete and stochastic formulations

The discretized version of the SIRS model when disease-induced deaths are not considered is given by the following set of t=01...t fnl when simulated over the interval [0t fnl ]

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{SIRS discrete-time model}} \\ S(t+1) & = & \left(1- p_{\text{SI}}\right)S(t) + p_{\text{RS}} R(t) \quad S(0)=N_{0}-1 \\ I(t+1) & = & \left(1- p_{\text{IR}}\right)I(t) + p_{\text{SI}} S(t) \quad \ \ I(0)=1 \\ R(t+1) & = & \left(1- p_{\text{RS}}\right)R(t) + p_{\text{IR}} I(t) \quad R(0)=0 \end{array}$$ (13)

where the proportions p XY are related to the rates œÅ XY by the equation (see Table 1 and cf. Eq. 12)

$$p_{\text{XY}} = 1- e^{-\rho_{\text{XY}}} \quad \text{X}

e \text{Y and X Y} = \text{ S I and R}$$ (14)

Thus as required p XY =0 when œÅ XY =0 and p XY ‚Üí1 as œÅ XY ‚Üí‚àû.

A discrete-time stochastic version of this model is obtained from Eq. 13 by assuming that the quantities p SI represent probabilities proportions. (Note: Continuous-time stochastic models require a level of mathematical treatment beyond the scope of this presentation; e.g see [42]). In this case the simulation takes the form of a discrete-time Monte Carlo process in which drawings from a binomial distribution are considered rather than computations of proportional change. Specifically simulation involves the following drawings using the following notation to denote such drawings (aka samplings):

$$\hat X_{p} \sim \texttt{BINOMIAL}[Xp] \quad \text{with expected value}\ {pX}\ \text{and variance} p(1-p)X$$

We note that \(\hat X_{p}\) is the actual number of actual objects drawn or sampled from a total of X objects where each object has the probability p of being selected (and hence 1‚àíp of not being selected).

Formally our stochastic model is the following Monte Carlo simulation that begins with specified values for S(0) I(0) R(0) and D(0) and continues with successive samplings for t=12...t fnl :

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{SIRS stochastic model}} \\ \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) & \sim & \texttt{BINOMIAL}[S(t)p_{\text{SI}}] \\ \hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) & \sim & \texttt{BINOMIAL}[I(t)p_{\text{IR}}] \\ \hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) & \sim & \texttt{BINOMIAL}[R(t)p_{\text{RS}}] \\ S(t+1) & = & S(t) - \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) + \hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) \quad S(0)=N_{0}-1 \\ I(t+1) & = & I(t) -\hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) + \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) \quad \ \ I(0)=1 \\ R(t+1) & = & R(t) -\hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) \quad R(0)=0 \end{array}$$ (15)

SIRS+D stochastic formulation

The discrete-time and stochastic models given by Eqs. 13 and 15 do not include disease-induced mortality (aka to mathematical epidemiologists as virulence). Thus they are only useful for considering the start or initial growth of epidemics or epidemics where disease-induced mortality is inconsequential. Including deaths requires consideration of competing rates/risk for individuals leaving particular disease classes. For example when deaths are considered individuals leave class I to either recover (R) or die (D). In this case a competing rates formulation (Table 2) is needed to simulate outcomes. In particular in the SIRS+D continuous-time model (Eq. 5) the prevalence equation (I(t)) involves the competing rates of recovery (œÅ IR ) and disease-induced mortality (œÅ ID ). Thus applying a competing rates formula we obtain (Table 2 Eq. 2.3 with Œît=1)

$$p_{\text{IX}}=\frac{\rho_{\text{IX}}}{\rho_{\text{IR}}+\rho_{\text{ID}}}\left(1-e^{-(\rho_{\text{IR}}+\rho_{\text{ID}})} \right) \ \ \text{X = R and D}$$ (16)

Since individuals in the prevalence class I are now faced with two possibilities of where to go‚Äîi.e. recover or die‚Äîthe stochastic version of the model requires that the binomial drawing be replaced with a multinomomial drawing that depends on the two probabilities p IR and p ID . This requires that we use a multinomial function that in general for the case of n‚àí1 leaving options with competing probabilities p i  i=1...n‚àí1 and not to move at all with probability \(p_{n}=\left (1-\sum _{i=1}^{n-1}p_{i}\right) \ge 0\). We use the following convention to specify the values obtained in one such multinomial sampling:

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} \left(\hat X_{1}...\hat X_{n-1} \right) & \sim & \texttt{MULTINOMIAL}[X;p_{1}\cdotsp_{n-1}] \\ \text{noting that} \ \ \hat X_{n} & = & X - \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} \hat X_{i} \ \ \text{and recalling that} \ \ p_{n}=\left(1-\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}p_{i}\right) \ge 0 \end{array}$$ (17)

Thus the model is now given by (cf. Eq 15)

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{SIRS+D stochastic model}} \\ \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) & \sim & \texttt{BINOMIAL}[S(t)p_{\text{SI}}] \\ \left(\hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) \hat I_{\mathrm{D}}(t)\right) & \sim & \texttt{MULTINOMIAL}[I(t);p_{\text{IR}}p_{\text{ID}}] \\ \hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) & \sim & \texttt{BINOMIAL}[R(t)p_{\text{RS}}] \\ S(t+1) & = & S(t) - \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) + \hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) \hspace{1.75cm} S(0)=N_{0}-1 \\ I(t+1) & = & I(t) -\hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) -\hat I_{\mathrm{D}}(t) + \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) \qquad \ I(0)=1 \\ R(t+1) & = & R(t) -\hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) \hspace{1.75cm} R(0)=0 \\ D(t+1) & = & D(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{D}}(t) \hspace{2.85cm} D(0)=0 \end{array}$$ (18)

SIRS+DTV: including treatment and vaccination

We now add treatment (T) and vaccination (V) classes to our SIRS+D model and define

$$N(t) = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) + T(t) + V(t) \quad N(0)=N_{0}$$ (19)

For simplicity we assume that individuals under treatment are no longer able to transmit pathogens to the population at large‚Äîi.e. they are essentially completely quarantined. In reality however the situation is much more complicated than this: the ability of individuals under treatment to transmit pathogens depends on how strict the quarantine procedures are. In addition if we structure the population to include healthcare workers or members of the infected individuals household then clearly these healthcare workers and household members are likely to be at some particular risk of infection from individuals under treatment. Thus moving beyond our simplifying assumption of individuals under treatment being effectively completely quarantined requires additional model structure and transmission parameters which is not included in the model formulated here.

Deterministic formulation

The dynamic equations consist of the following system of 5 differential equations augmented by the three integrations that allow us to keep track of the accumulating deaths (D(t)) cases that are treated (Ttotal(t)) and individuals that are fully vaccinated (Vtotal(t))

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{SIRS+DTV deterministic cont.-time model}} \\ \frac{dS}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{RS}} R + \rho_{\text{VS}}V - (\rho_{\text{SI}} +\rho_{\text{SV}})S \quad S(0)=S_{0} \\ \frac{dI}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{SI}} S - (\rho_{\text{IR}} + \rho_{\text{IT}} + \rho_{\text{ID}})I \qquad \ \ I(0)=I_{0} \\ \frac{dR}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{IR}} I + \rho_{\text{TR}} T - (\rho_{\text{RS}} + \rho_{\text{RV}}) R \quad R(0)=R_{0} \\ \frac{dT}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{IT}} I - (\rho_{\text{TR}} + \rho_{\text{TD}}) T \qquad \quad T(0)=T_{0} \\ \frac{dV}{dt} & = & \rho_{\text{SV}} S + \rho_{\text{RV}}R - \rho_{\text{VS}}V \qquad \quad V(0)=V_{0} \\ D(t) & = & \int_{0}^{t}\left(\rho_{\text{ID}} I(t) + \rho_{\text{TD}} T(t)\right) dt \\ T^{\text{total}}(t) & = & \int_{0}^{t} \rho_{\text{IT}} I(t) dt \\ V^{\text{total}}(t) & = & \int_{0}^{t} \left(\rho_{\text{SV}} S(t) + \rho_{\text{RV}} R(t)\right) dt \end{array}$$ (20)

For simplicity we will initially assume a constant treatment rate œÅ IT =œÅ treat that is implemented from the onset of the epidemic being modeled. However we will place a maximum Tmax on the number of individuals that can be in treatment at anyone time due to a limited capacity of the healthcare system to take care of sick individuals. Thus we have

$${\text{Treatment intervention}} \qquad \qquad \rho_{\text{IT}}(t)= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \rho_{\text{treat}} & \quad \text{when } T(t) \le T^{\max} \\ 0 & \quad \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right.$$ (21)

This intervention however will be available to the user to elaborate through a RAM (runtime alternative module) that is the hallmark of our RAMP (runtime alterable model platform) technology. Equation 21 will be the Default formulation while alternative 1 will be constant application of œÅ IT with not upper limit.

For the sake of completeness we note that since the outflow from I now includes both flows to R T and D the expression for R 0 in Eq. 11 while individuals in T and D are assumed not to transmit pathogen (note for disease such as Ebola pathogen is transmitted from individuals in D preparation of the corpses for burial [43]) now becomes

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{Reproductive value}} {(\text{with quarantined treatment and disease-induce death})} \\ R_{0} & = & \frac{\kappa\beta}{\rho_{\text{IR}}+\rho_{\text{IT}}+\rho_{\text{ID}}} \end{array}$$ (22)

For simplicity we will initially assume a constant vaccination rate v that is implemented from time \(\phantom {\dot {i}\!}t_{\mathrm {V}_{\text {on}}}\) onwards. As with treatment we will place an upper bound on the number of vaccination regimens that can be administered where a vaccination regimen is defined to be a complete course that consists of one or more shots over a specified interval of time. Note for simplicity we assume that the full effect of the vaccination starts at the time of administering the first shot in the prescribed regimen (at which time the individual is transferred to V from S C L R or Q as the case may be). An individual that later transfers from R back to S may then receive a second regime in an ongoing vaccination rollout program. The vaccination rate v itself will be available to the user to elaborate through our Vacc RAM (runtime alternative module). Thus our default vaccination rollout program is defined by

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} {\text{Vaccination rollout}}&& \\ \rho_{\text{XV}}(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} v & \quad \text{for}\ t_{\mathrm{V}_{\text{on}}} \ge t\ \text{and}\ V^{\text{total}}\le V^{\text{max}}\  \text{X = S C L R and Q} \\ 0 & \quad \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \end{array}$$ (23)

This function will be alternative 1 of the Vacc RAM of our RAMP.

Stochastic formulation

For each time step in the stochastic simulation (t=012...t fnl ‚àí1) we need to transform all the rates œÅ XY (t) (used in the continuous-time formulation) to probabilities p XY (t) using the rates to proportions transformation Eq. 2.2 in Table 2. We then proceed at each time step to use these probabilities in the Monte Carlo drawings followed by computing next values using the updating equations as specified below:

$$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} && {\text{SIRS+DTV stochastic model}} \\ \left(\hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t)\hat S_{\mathrm{V}}(t)\right) & \sim & \texttt{MULTINOMIAL}[S(t);p_{\text{SI}}(t)p_{\text{SV}}(t)] \\ \left(\hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) \hat I_{\mathrm{T}}(t) \hat I_{\mathrm{D}}(t)\right) & \sim & \texttt{MULTINOMIAL}[I(t);p_{\text{IR}}(t)p_{\text{IT}}(t)p_{\text{ID}}(t)] \\ \left(\hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) \hat R_{\mathrm{V}}(t)\right) & \sim & \texttt{MULTINOMIAL}[R(t);p_{\text{RS}}(t)p_{\text{RV}}(t)] \\ \left(\hat T_{\mathrm{R}}(t) \hat T_{\mathrm{D}}(t)\right) & \sim & \texttt{MULTINOMIAL}[T(t);p_{\text{TR}}(t)p_{\text{TD}}(t)] \\ \hat V_{\mathrm{S}}(t) & \sim & \texttt{BINOMIAL}[V(t)p_{\text{VS}}(t)] \\ S(t+1) & = & S(t) - \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t)- \hat S_{\mathrm{V}}(t) + \hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) + \hat V_{\mathrm{S}}(t) \quad S(0)=N_{0}-1 \\ I(t+1) & = & I(t) -\hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) - \hat I_{\mathrm{T}}(t) - \hat I_{\mathrm{D}}(t) + \hat S_{\mathrm{I}}(t) \quad \ \ \ I(0)=1 \\ R(t+1) & = & R(t) -\hat R_{\mathrm{S}}(t) - \hat R_{\mathrm{V}}(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{R}}(t) + \hat T_{\mathrm{R}}(t) \quad R(0)=0 \\ T(t+1) & = & T(t) - \hat T_{\mathrm{R}}(t)- \hat T_{\mathrm{D}}(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{T}}(t) \qquad \qquad \ \ \ T(0)=0 \\ V(t+1) & = & V(t) - \hat V_{\mathrm{S}}(t) + \hat S_{\mathrm{V}}(t)+ \hat R_{\mathrm{V}}(t) \qquad \qquad \ V(0)=0 \\ D(t+1) & = & D(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{D}}(t) + \hat T_{\mathrm{D}}(t) \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \ \ \ D(0)=0 \\ T^{\text{total}}(t+1) & = & T^{\text{total}}(t) + \hat I_{\mathrm{T}}(t) \hspace{3cm} T^{\text{total}}(0)=0 \\ V^{\text{total}}(t+1) & = & V^{\text{total}}(t) + \hat S_{\mathrm{V}}(t) + \hat R_{\mathrm{V}}(t) \hspace{1.7cm} V^{\text{total}}(0)=0 \end{array}$$ (24)

Once the simulation is complete we will have generated time series for all the disease class variables X(t) t=0...t fnl  X=S I R T and V as well as an incidence time-series \(\hat S_{I}(t)\) and new deaths time-series \(\Delta D(t)=\hat I_{\mathrm {D}}(t) + \hat T_{\mathrm {D}}(t)\) over t=1...t fnl .

RAMP implementation

Here we provide a brief description of the structure and operation of our four RAMPs each of which is an HTML file the implements the reference models as a Numerus Model Builder RAMP application

SIRS_Det.xml implements the continuous-time deterministic model represented by Eq. 5 with œÅ ID fixed at 0

SIRS_Sto.xml implements the discrete-time stochastic model represented by Eq. 15

SIRS+DTV_Det.xml implements the continuous-time deterministic model represented by Eq. 20

SIRS+DTV_Sto.xml implements the discrete-time stochastic model represented by Eq. 24

SIRS+DTV continuous-time deterministic and discrete-time stochastic RAMPs while the structure and operations of our simpler SIRS continuous-time deterministic and discrete-time stochastic RAMPs are just a subset of descriptions of the more complicated RAMPs once elements relating to death (D) treatment (T) and vaccination (V) processes are removed. The RAMPs are built with the Numerus Model Builder Designer (NMB Designer). Once built the NMB Designer is used to generate a RAMP as an HTML file with a user provided name. This file can then be read and implemented by using NMB Studio. This application is available for free at the Numerus Website (URL). The reader and the RAMP HTML files for the continuous-time deterministic and discrete-time stochastic SIRS+DTV RAMPs are available at our Numerus Model Builder Website where more information on using these RAMPs is available at the Numerus Website.

Deterministic RAMP dashboard

Once NMB Studio has been download from the Numerus Model Builder Website installed launched and the Continuous-time deterministic SIRS+DTV RAMP HTML file has been read in the dashboard depicted in Fig. 2 appears. It is used to load saved or reset parameter values for simulations initiate runs generate graphs and save simulation results in the form of CSV files. We note that every object on the dashboard (parameter sliders RAM rollers and graphs) has a string of three alphanumeric characters (which we refer to as airport codes) associated with it that is used in scripts to control parameter values select runtime alternative module (RAM) options and select among graphing options. The various dashboard windows and their functions are:

Fig. 2 The dashboard of the SIRS+DTV continuous time RAMP is depicted here with graphical results of a run made over the interval [070] using the set of values appearing in the windows of the 13 sliders available for manipulating 13 parameters (also see Table 1) in the model. Note that in the Epidemic Curves (EPC) graph the Dead_(D/N) button is in gray because this graph is switched off though the total number of deaths are plotted (blue curve) in the Accumulated Totals (ACT) graph. Note that the left control roller for Kappa (KAP) is in green because the Constant mode (roller value 1) for this RAM has been selected rather than the Default (which would be in blue and the roller value would be 0) which is the Adaptive Contact mode expressed in Eq. 10 (also see Fig. 4) Full size image

Main window (from left to right and top to bottom)

Parameter sliders Name (Airport Code mathematical symbol) Baseline contact rate (KP0 Œ∫ 0 ) This parameter in Eq. 10 is the contact rate at the start of the epidemic (i.e. Œ∫ (0)= Œ∫ 0 ). Contact rate scaling (KPS P Œ∫ ) This parameter in Eq. 10 is the prevalence (proportion of infectious individuals) at which the baseline contact rate is reduced by a half (i.e. Œ∫ ( t )= Œ∫ 0 /2 when I ( t )/ N ( t )= P Œ∫ ). Transmission parameter (BET Œ≤ ) This parameter interpreted as the ‚Äòforce of infection‚Äô appears in Eqs. 7 and 8 as seen in Eq. 12 when multiplied by the contact rate Œ∫ ( t ) essentially determines the probability of infection per contact. Recovery rate (RIR œÅ I R ) This is the flow rate from the infectious to the immune disease class: it also is the inverse the infectious period (see Eq. 1.2 in Table 1). Loss-of-immunity rate (RRS œÅ I R ‚â° œÅ I V ) These are the rates at which individuals return from disease classes R and V (for simplicity assumed equal in our model) to become susceptible again in disease class S. Their inverse is the period immunity remains effective (see Eq. 1.2 in Table 1). Disease induced death rate (RID œÅ I D ) This parameter referred to as the virulence parameter Œ± by mathematical ecologists specifies the per capita prevalence rate at which infected individuals die over time. Treat (TRT œÅ t r e a t ) This parameter is the rate at which infectious individuals are placed under treatment provided the treatment capacity T max has not been exceeded (see Eq. 21 for details of how œÅ IT is defined in terms of œÅ treat and T max ). A key effect of treatment is to reduce the rate of contact of infectious individuals in class T compared with those in class I. In our model we assume that individuals in class T no longer transmit pathogens to susceptible individuals although in more complex models some transmission may occur particularly to healthcare workers (but this is assumed to be negligible in our formulation). Treatment capacity (TRC T max ) This parameter places a limit on how many individuals can be under treatment at any one time. When this level is reached then new patients are limited by the rate at which individuals leave treatment because of death or recovery. Treatment discharge rate (RTR œÅ TR ) This is the rate at which individuals under treatment are released to join the immune class R. Death rate under treatment (RTD œÅ TD ) This is the rate at which individuals under treatment die from the disease. This rate may be greater or less than the disease-induced death rate for individuals in disease class I‚Äîthe former when only the most severe cases are treated and the latter when treatment is at least somewhat effective. Vaccination onset time (VOT \(\phantom {\dot {i}\!}t_{\mathrm {V}_{\text {on}}}\) ) This is the time that the vaccination rollout program begins on the interval [0 t fnl ] (i.e. it may be the start of the simulation or some way into the simulation). Vaccination regimens available (VAM V max ) This parameter sets an upper limit to the total number of vaccination regimens that can be administered (whether a regimen consists of one two or more shots in a defined space of time the number of regimens rather than shots are counted) Vaccination rate (VAR v ) This rate only applies for \(\phantom {\dot {i}\!}t\ge t_{\mathrm {V}_{\text {on}}}\) and as long as V max has not been reached.

RAMs Code name Descriptive name (Airport code mathematical symbol) in blue when default option is selected (roller value 0) and in green when an alternative value is selected (roller value 1 corresponds to constant values over the simulation interval roller values > 1 will be user supplied options; text in red if the reset button needs to be toggled) Kappa Adaptive Contact (KAP Œ∫ ( t )) The Default (roller 0) for this expression as given by Eq. 10 involves the baseline contact rate Œ∫ 0  the contact rate scaling constant P Œ∫ and the transmission parameter Œ≤ . Alternate roller 1 labeled Constant is the constant value Œ∫ 0 . Treat_Rate Treatment Flow Rate (RIT œÅ IT ) The Default (roller 0) for this expression as given by Eq. 21 involves the baseline treatment rate œÅ treat and the treatment capacity parameter T max . Alternate roller 1 labeled Constant is the constant value œÅ treat . rSV Vaccinate S (RSV œÅ SV ) The Default (roller 0) for this expression as given by Eq. 23 involves the baseline treatment rate v  treatment onset time \(\phantom {\dot {i}\!}t_{\mathrm {V}_{\text {on}}}\) and the treatment regimens available parameter V max . Alternate roller 1 labeled Constant is the constant value v . rRV Vaccinate R (RRV œÅ RV ) The Default (roller 0) and alternative Constant (roller 0) as exactly the same as Vaccinate S. This option has been provided in case the user wants to vaccinate disease class R in a different manner to disease class S. This would require the classes R and S can be distinguished by the healthcare establishement.

Graphs Name (Airport code) Epidemic curves (EPC) This graph allows the user to plot the proportion of individuals in disease classes S I R and D over the chosen simulation interval or to select one of these four variables to create a comparative graph over multiple runs. Accumulated totals (ACT) This graph allows the user to plot the accumulating number of deaths ( D ( t )) vaccinated ( V total ( t )) and treated ( T total ( t )) individuals as time progress or to select one of these three variables to create a comparative graph over multiple runs. Epidemic progress (EPP) This graph allows the user to plot the effective reproductive rate ( R eff ( t )) or prevalence ( I ( t ) repeat of second graph in EPC) over time or to select one of these two variables to create a comparative graph over multiple runs.



Stochastic SIRS+DTV RAMP dashboard

As with the Continuous-time SIRS+DTV RAMP the latest available version of the Stochastic SIRS+DTV RAMP can be downloaded at our Numerus Model Builder Website where more information on using the RAMP is available. The dashboard of the Stochastic SIRS+DTV RAMP is the same as its continuous time counterpart except the dt window is now replaced as follows:

Seed window This window (center of top ribbon) anchors the sequence of pseudo random numbers used to in the simulation to a particular starting point: if this window is empty then the starting point is random otherwise it can be specified by a number ranging for 0 to 264‚àí1.

There are also one additional slider in the stochastic dashboard

Parameter sliders Name (Airport Code mathematical symbol) Popsize (PSZ N 0 ) This parameter is the initial population size N 0 that appears in Eq. 24 where the initial number in disease class S is S (0)= N 0 ‚àí1.



The reason why population size does not appear in the Continuous-time SIRS+DTV RAMP is that the solution to continuous time model Eq. 20 is scale free relative to the size of N 0 (i.e. every equation in this model can be divided by N 0 to obtain a system of equations on the time course of the proportions S/N 0  I/N 0  R/N 0  T/N 0  and V/N 0  so that the equations are now independent of our choice of N 0  provided the initial conditions are set to the corresponding set of fractional values. On the other hand the variance associated with demographic stochasticity depends on absolute values (viz. the variance associate with multinomial sampling is inversely proportional to the square root of population size) which implies that the behavior of the initial outbreak is nearly (i.e. provided S(t)/N(t) remains very close to 1) independent of population size provided the transmission is purely frequency dependent (i.e does not have a density dependent component to it).

Every run of the stochastic RAMP for a given set of parameter values will be slightly different unless these runs are made with the same value inserted in the Seed slot in the middle of the top ribbon of the stochastic SIRS RAMP (Fig. 3). To make sure that the same seed is used at the start of a new run the Restart RNG on Reset square below the seed window can be checked. To answer many questions it is often likely to be more useful to make multiple runs and provide statistics related to quantities of interest than to make and present a single run. This idea will be further developed in the ‚ÄúStochastic SIRS dynamics‚Äù section. In terms of visual interest repeated runs can be compared by selecting the Comparison mode slot above each graph and making sure that all by one of the graphs that can be plotted with each graph (see lists below each graph in Fig. 2 which can be selected or deselected by clicking on the appropriate small circular button. In the two graphs in Fig. 3A. the proportion of immune individuals and number of infectious individuals are plotted for 10 comparative runs for set of values indicated in the slider windows and in Table 3 when not available for slider selection.

Fig. 3 Ten comparative runs of the stochastic SIRS RAMP using the parameters values depicted by the sliders (or fixed according to values listed in Table 1). In panel A. the population size is 1000 in panel B. it is 10000 while in panel C. a vertically magnified version of prevalences for the three runs that failed to take off in panel A (Runs 6 7 and 9; such runs are expected as discussed in the Results Section in the context of Eq. 25) are plotted on their own Full size image

Operation of runtime alternative modules (RAMs)

The four RAMs all operate in the same manner. The Default modes (value 0 on roller selectors and text in blue) for the Adaptive Contact Treatment Flow Rate Vaccinate S and Vaccinate R modules are respectively coded by Eqs. 10 21 23 and again 23. Along with these a Constant alternative mode (value 1 on the roller selectors and text in green though text is in red when still to be included by pressing the reset button on the top ribbon of the Dashboard) is available for each of these. Information on these alternatives is provided in the window opened by toggling the Op On button second from the left on top ribbon of the dashboard (Fig. 2). This window (Fig. 4A.) allows the user to select the RAM of interest (bottom left hand list). Once selected (in Fig. 4A. for say the Adaptive Contact RAM the Default Kappa option is shown) the window provides an option to select the Default RAM (left text inner window contains general information; the right top text inner window contains specific information pertaining to the particular alternative selected; and the bottom right inner window contains the coded expression that will be used). Panel B Fig. 4B.) depicts selection of alternative 1 for the Kappa RAM along with the its specific information inner window and coding inner window. Next to the buttons to select the alternatives 0 and 1 is a ‚Äú+‚Äù button (bottom of panel B Fig. 4) that users can be use to add as many alternatives numbered 2 3... etc. as desired.

Fig. 4 When the Op On button (second button from the left on the top strip of an SIRS+DTV RAMP as depicted in Fig. 2 is selected the window depicted here opens (panel A.). At the bottom left hand side we see that we have four RAMs (runtime alterable modules) options pertaining to the formulations of the functions Kappa (Œ∫(t)) rIT (œÅ IT ) rSV (œÅ SV ) and rRV (œÅ RV ). We also see that the Kappa RAM has been selected. The Default option (number 0) of this RAM is the adaptive form given by Eq. 10 (it appears in the window on the left of panel A. with some specific details pertaining to this mode provided in the window on the right of panel A.). Inset B. shows the alternate form (number 1) for Œ∫(t) which is simply setting it equal to the constant Œ∫ 0 . The user may insert an additional alternate form for this RAM by selecting the ‚Äòplus‚Äô button bottom middle of panel B. and then adding the desired from in the Code window on the left-hand side Full size image

Scripting windows

Two types of scripting windows are available. The S On and JS On buttons (first and third buttons on top ribbon in Fig. 2) can be used to write or load in scripts respectively written in RPL (RAMP Programming Language; Fig. 5) or JavaScript. These scripts enable the user to control individual runs either by changing parameter values and RAM settings or make multiple runs (Fig. 4) and plot these using the comparative window facility (Fig. 6). Accessing the window in which this script can be entered or loaded from a saved file is described in Fig. 4‚Äôs legend as is accessing the window containing a list of the RPL commands that can be used to write such scripts.

Fig. 5 Here we depict three panels or windows associated with the scripting utilities of our RAMPs. Panel A (black bordered panel): When the S On button (first button from the left on the top strip of a RAMP as depicted in Fig. 2) is selected this window opens. In the bottom left corner of this window is a Command Reference button (covered here by panel C) when pressed opens panel B. Panel B (blue bordered panel): RPL Reference window containing a list of commands that can be used to automate multiple runs or make changes to component values or modes during runs. The second column of text in the Script window (panel A.) contains 17 lines of instructions (saved as MultiPrevScript.txt as seen in the top right hand window slot of the S On window) that codes the RAMP to make six repeated runs of the model where in each of the runs the value of KP0 (Œ∫ 0 ) is increased in value from 0.5 starting with the value specified in the model and described further in Fig. 6. Panel C (orange bordered panel): When the JS On button (third button from the left on the top strip of the RAMP as depicted in Fig. 2) is selected this window opens.

Fig. 6 The script depicted in Fig. 5 is used to run the deterministic SIRS+DTV RAMP 6 times using the parameters values depicted by the sliders (or fixed according to values listed in Table 1). The KP0 (top left-hand) slider in this figure shows a value of 4.5 which implies the 6 runs ranged from a start value of 2.0 to 4.5 in increments of 0.5. Note that each of the three graphs available on the dashboard has only one its several possible options selected (available options can be seen below the graphs in Fig. 2) and the small rectangular comparison window above each graph has been selected to ensure that graphs generated during each of the 6 runs remain plotted once all runs are complete. The c Clear button above each graph allows earlier graphs to be erased when desired Full size image

Help file and airport codes

When the Help menu of a RAMP is selected information about the RAMP will appear together with a list of all the objects in the RAMP that can be referred to using airport codes (Fig. 7). In the parameter list on the left of Fig. 7) any parameter that has not been turned into a slider will have is Fixed Value listed in red. In our two SIRS RAMPs though not in the our two SIRS+DTV RAMPs the value of Œ≤ (Airport code: BET) has been fixed 0.3 because only the product of Œ∫Œ≤ is relevant in determining the disease transmission rate œÅ SI for a particular prevalence level I(t)/N(t) (Eq. 7). The value of this product is thus manipulated using the Œ∫ 0 slider because Œ∫ 0 scales the value of Œ∫ at time t as expressed in Eq. 10.

Fig. 7 When the Help menu of RAMPs is selected information about the RAMP is provided. Here we see the information provided about the stochastic SIRS+DTV RAMP. This information includes the airport codes for the parameters variables and graphs as well as descriptions associated with the sliders which can also be accessed by mousing over the relevant sliders on the Dashboard Full size image

Saving the data from each run

A file location can be set up for the automated saving of CSV files (see Fig. 8 for details) which is particularly useful when the RAMP is used to make a series of runs each differing in some sense (e.g. but changing a slider value and then rerunning the RAMP). The user can select what values should be saved using the CSV Settings... window. As indicated in Fig. 8 each file is saved with its own date stamp. Each CSV file is automatically headed with the set of parameter values and RAMP selections that were used to generate the data in the file.

Fig. 8 A. (black bordered panel) Each run can be saved at a user selected location that is set up using the pull down CSV menu on the top left-hand corner of the dashboard window (also see Fig. 2). B. (blue bordered panel) Once the CSV Settings option is selected a window opens that allows that user to select which disease states and computed time-series should be included in the CSV file which will be saved at the specified directory (example given here in the window at the bottom of the CSV Selection window.

Using RAMPs within the r statistical and data analysis platform

The exposition here applies to the use of Numerus Model Builder RAMPs as virtual packages in the implementation of R on the RStudio platform. The following steps should be followed to accomplish the match up between RStudio and NMB Studio (the Numerus Model Builder RAMP player) to implement the desired analyses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGVzdGF0ZS9uYW1lL3dpbGxpYW0taG9mZi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjIxNTIzNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,William Hoff Obituary (1952 - 2022) - Eastvale CA - The State,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/thestate/name/william-hoff-obituary?id=36215235 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGVzdGF0ZS9uYW1lL3dpbGxpYW0taG9mZi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjIxNTIzNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Dabbling in grocery couponing might seem tedious and overwhelming but it‚Äôs a way to keep more money in your pocket when you venture to the grocery store.

You may also be relieved to know that collecting grocery coupons doesn‚Äôt have to become a hobby (or obsession) to save money. Below is a newbie guide to couponing to help you get started.

Grocery coupons: what they are and how they work

At a very basic level a coupon is a discount that shoppers can use to pay less for an item. In the world of grocery coupons these are the main coupon types:

Store coupons: Store coupons have to be redeemed at their corresponding store. For example you can only use a Giant or Kroger coupon at Giant or Kroger.

Store coupons have to be redeemed at their corresponding store. For example you can only use a Giant or Kroger coupon at Giant or Kroger. Manufacturer‚Äôs coupons: Manufacturer‚Äôs coupons come from the manufacturer and could be used in many different types of stores. For example a General Mills coupon could be used to buy General Mills products at any grocery store that accepts the coupon.

For example a General Mills coupon could be used to buy General Mills products at any grocery store that accepts the coupon. Catalina coupons: Catalina coupons are the coupons that print off of your receipt when you check out which could be manufacturer coupons and other store-related discounts.

Catalina coupons are the coupons that print off of your receipt when you check out which could be manufacturer coupons and other store-related discounts. Loyalty coupons: If you‚Äôre a member of a particular store you might get special coupons and discounts exclusively for members.

The discount opportunity of a coupon can vary. For example some coupons will give you a certain dollar amount off for buying one item or two items.

In other cases you may get to buy one item and a second one free. Reading the terms and conditions for each coupon could help you spot exclusions of items not covered by the discount.

Where to get coupons

We all know you can get coupons in the Sunday paper but that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg. Shoppers can also get coupons online through sites like Coupons.com Redplum.com TheKrazyKouponLady.com and SmartSource.com.

Besides going to coupon websites that aggregate coupons you may be able to go directly to a grocery store‚Äôs site to find coupons. Below is a snapshot of what Harris Teeter has to offer.

Lastly manufacturers may have their own coupon and rewards sites. For example PepsiCo has its Tasty Rewards website where you can find offers on beverages and a wide range of PepsiCo food products such as Doritos Quaker Oats and more.

How to maximize coupons

Now this is where the magic happens. You may have seen episodes of reality TV shows where people are buying groceries and actually getting money back instead of paying for their large haul.

How do they do this? Here are a few ways:

Use multiple coupons on one item. Some retailers will let you use multiple coupons on one product and pairing a manufacturer's coupon with a store coupon could help you pay next to nothing for products. If the coupon equals more than the item's price you could even get a credit toward your bill.

Some retailers will let you use multiple coupons on one product and pairing a manufacturer's coupon with a store coupon could help you pay next to nothing for products. If the coupon equals more than the item's price you could even get a credit toward your bill. Use coupons on discounted products. If a store is running a special on an item whipping out a coupon for that product could help you pocket even more money.

If a store is running a special on an item whipping out a coupon for that product could help you pocket even more money. Some stores will double coupons. Sometimes stores will double the value of your coupons. For example if you have a coupon for 25 cents they'll bump up that value to 50 cents. The website Grocery Coupons Guide lists grocery stores in each state where you may be able to get double value. There's no mention on the list when the information is updated so you could use it as a starting point but you may need to confirm offers with the retailers mentioned.

Reading the fine print can help you avoid having your coupons denied at checkout when trying tactics like using multiple coupons at once.

And if your coupons get denied don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthink of it as practice and get clarification on how you can use them next time.

Putting a coupon strategy into practice

Couponing can get overwhelming if you have a bunch of paper lying around that‚Äôs hard to find when you want to make a purchase. Here are a few tips that could help you start couponing with less stress:

Audit your pantry. Take note of the products and brands you buy so you can keep an eye out for relevant coupons and make a point to check out manufacturer websites for deals on brands you regularly use.

7. Oreo X Pokemon cookies

Many people may have heard about this crossover as there was a slight panic when it came out. These packs were flying off the shelf to find the rarest Pokemon in the Oreo collaboration: Mew. All the packs have randomized Pokemon on the cookies and the Mew Oreo was fetching high prices when it first released. Now the craze has blown over a bit but it‚Äôs still cool to eat Oreos featuring some of the greatest Pokemon in the series. Get them here.

6. Converse X Pokemon sneakers

What‚Äôs more iconic than Pokemon collaborating with some of the most recognizable shoes of all time?

BMW‚Äôs recent move to charge car owners in several countries $18 per month to turn on the heated seats in their own vehicles sparked a public outcry with some would-be buyers calling the move a ‚Äúdealbreaker.‚Äù

But it‚Äôs not just BMW: industry watchers and consumer advocates warn that the nickel-and-diming threatens to become standard as automakers chase a recurring revenue model pioneered by Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla.

General Motors recently started requiring buyers of Buick GMC and Cadillac Escalade vehicles to pay $1500 for the mandatory ‚Äúoption‚Äù of buying three years of OnStar service which includes features like voice control and the ability to unlock vehicles from a mobile app. OnStar had previously been optional since GM introduced it in 1996.

3 Toyota started charging for its key fob ‚Äî a feature that had previously been free. Bloomberg via Getty Images

Toyota meanwhile started charging $8 a month to remotely start vehicles using a key fob ‚Äî a feature that had previously been free. Volkswagen Porsche and Audi lately have explored similar subscriptions.

It‚Äôs just the beginning industry experts say as manufacturers look to transform cars from simple goods for sale into bases for recurring revenue that could fill coffers for years or decades.

General Motors has told investors it aims to generate up to $25 billion in software and services subscription revenue annually by 2030 ‚Äî up from an estimated $2 billion in 2021. Stellantis formerly known as Fiat Chrysler is shooting for $23 billion by 2030.

‚ÄúMost automakers in the last couple of years have started talking about generating huge increases in revenue over the next decade primarily off the backs of software and other subscription services‚Äù Guidehouse Insights‚Äô e-mobility analyst Sam Abuelsamid told The Post.

3 BMW fans have raged at the automaker charging for access to already-installed heated seats. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images

‚ÄúThe approach that these companies are taking so far is certainly not customer friendly‚Äù he added singling out GM‚Äôs mandatory OnStar as effectively a ‚Äúbogus‚Äù and a ‚Äúhidden price hike.‚Äù

The subscription push was pioneered by Tesla. Elon Musk‚Äôs electric automaker charges $9.99 per month to access music streaming satellite maps and other features. It also asks a whopping $200 per month or a $12000 one-time payment to access its experimental ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving‚Äù option.

On Sunday Musk announced on Twitter his company will hike the price of the FSD option by 25% to $15000 starting Sept. 5.

Abuelsamid said that other automakers are ‚Äúfooling themselves‚Äù with their plans to juice revenue through subscription plans ‚Äî and predicted they will run into consumers‚Äô ‚Äúsubscription fatigue‚Äù a trend recently evidenced by Netflix bleeding about 1.2 million subscribers in the first half of 2022.

Just 25% of American car buyers say they would potentially be willing to pay extra for subscription car features according to a Cox Automotive survey from April.

BMW‚Äôs moves toward a subscription model which Abuelsamid called ‚Äúparticularly aggressive‚Äù have especially angered fans and would-be customers.

After news reports circulated in July about BMW‚Äôs $18-a-month heated seats charge in the United Kingdom Germany South Korea and other markets the luxury automaker was roundly roasted online.

One TikTok video with more than 24000 likes showed a BMW locking basic features like the speedometer and radio demanding cash for the renewal of a ‚Äúpremium membership.‚Äù

Another video with more than 160000 likes showed a BMW careening off a cliff with the caption ‚ÄúPOV: new BMW owners after they forget to pay their monthly steering subscription.‚Äù

Safety concerns aren‚Äôt entirely a joke according to Consumer Reports‚Äô associate director of safety policy Will Wallace. BMW currently requires car owners in some countries to pay roughly $12 per month to access a safety feature called ‚ÄúHigh Beam Assistant‚Äù which automatically turns off a car‚Äôs high beam lights when it senses another car to avoid blinding other drivers at night.

‚ÄúSafety should come standard‚Äù Wallace said of adaptive headlights. ‚ÄúSome automakers might think that those are simply a convenience feature but there‚Äôs a demonstrated safety benefit.‚Äù

Both Wallace and Abuelsamid said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should require automakers to put adaptive headlights in every car just like airbags and seatbelts.

While luxury auto brands are taking the most flak for subscription features mass market automakers will increasingly embrace the strategy in the coming years predicts National Association of Consumer Advocates executive director Ira Rheingold.

‚ÄúIt will definitely work its way down market‚Äù Rheingold said of subscriptions. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way that this is not coming to your basic car.‚Äù

He compared the change to how airlines have increasingly hit consumers with fees for services that were previously free such as carry-on baggage and seat selection.

‚ÄúDrip by drip people become more accepting of it‚Äù Rheingold said.

The joint venture has filed a tax abatement application there which it hopes will be approved this month she said. The fourth plant is expected to be very similar to the other three battery factories and will require an investment of more than two billion US dollars.

Production at Ultium Cells‚Äô first US battery cell plant in Ohio is expected to begin this month. Ultium Cells‚Äô second factory is reportedly being built next to GM‚Äôs vehicle plant in Spring Hill Tennessee. In January 2022 another battery cell manufacturing facility was announced in Lansing Michigan where General Motors also operates two vehicle plants. At the end of July it became known that the US Department of Energy would grant the battery joint venture of General Motors and LG Energy Solution a loan of 2.5 billion dollars.

According to Reuters the loan is still a ‚Äúconditional commitment‚Äù that is expected to be finalised in the coming months. Interesting detail: the money comes from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan programme which has not funded a new programme since 2010. The last AVTM borrower was Tesla but the ‚Äì then ‚Äì very small start-up had repaid the loan early in 2013. Ford and Nissan had also previously benefited from the favourable loan conditions from the programme. According to Reuters if the loan is finally approved and disbursed it would be the first loan from the US Department of Energy to exclusively fund a project for the production of battery cells for electric cars.

According to Reuters GM and LG Energy Solution are considering a site in New Carlisle Indiana. The joint venture had submitted a tax abatement application which is expected to be approved this month.

""Ultium Cells LLC ""is developing a competitive business case for a potential large investment that could be located in New Carlisle Indiana"" a spokeswoman said adding that Ultium had submitted a tax abatement application that it hopes will be approved later this month.""

The fourth Ultium Cells' factory most likely will be another large investment (potentially over $2 billion like the previous three plants) bringing a four-digit number of new jobs to the state.

Details remain unknown but we can assume that the manufacturing capacity might be at least 35-50 GWh with the potential for more.

Meanwhile the first Ultium Cells factory - in Lordstown Ohio - is expected to start production this month and is actively looking for more workers.

The plant in Spring Hill Tennessee is under construction (the main steel structure has been completed in June) while the site in Lansing Michigan announced in January is just starting construction.

With all plants online General Motors should easily exceed 100 GWh of annual lithium-ion battery cell production which will be crucial for the ramp-up of the Ultium-based electric vehicles.

GM's efforts to build battery plants might be supported by a loan granted by the federal government. In July the US Department of Energy (DOE) announced that intends to offer a $2.5 billion loan o Ultium Cells to help finance the construction of battery cell manufacturing plants in Ohio Tennessee and Michigan (see official details here).

Overall GM is gradually progressing on the electrification path. The company has a six-digit number of reservations for its all-new electric models (including 150000 Chevrolet Silverado EV and 80000 GMC Hummer EVs) and a growing number of new models launched or in the pipeline (like Cadillac Lyriq Chevrolet Blazer EV and Chevrolet Equinox EV to name just a few).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjAvZ20tZm9yZC1hbmQtZG9kZ2UtZWxlY3RyaWMtbXVzY2xlLWNhcnMtZmFjZS1sYXRlc3QtZXYtdHJhbnNpdGlvbi10ZXN0Lmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9nbS1mb3JkLWFuZC1kb2RnZS1lbGVjdHJpYy1tdXNjbGUtY2Fycy1mYWNlLWxhdGVzdC1ldi10cmFuc2l0aW9uLXRlc3QuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Motor City meets a new test in the EV transition: Keeping gearheads behind the wheel,"Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis unveils the Charger Daytona SRT electric muscle car concept on Aug. 17 2022 in Pontiac Mich. Michael Wayland / CNBC

PONTIAC Mich. ‚Äì At an event featuring headbanging '80s music and $2 beers this week Dodge unveiled a concept for its first electric muscle car that included an exhaust system and multi-speed transmission. The features aren't needed for an electric vehicle ‚àí but could be key for winning over die-hard fans of performance vehicles. ""Sound is a critical component"" Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis said. ""And the shifting is critical ‚Ä¶ we went round and round for the longest time. It does not make the car faster ‚Ä¶ but it's way more engaging and way more fun to drive."" As Detroit's legacy automakers race to work to transition to electric vehicles they're also trying to win over the long-time auto fans who love the sound of rumbling V-8 engines and the feel of shifting gears that gives them a visceral connection with cars. The sales heydays of muscle cars are decades in the past but the vehicles have become cultural touchstones that create massive awareness for brands and their customers remain loyal ambassadors. That hype can create a halo effect for other models that translates into sales.

In recent years Tesla has created a cult following for its EVs through its sleek tech-savvy vehicles and humming motors. But Detroit's Dodge Chevrolet and Ford brands have loyalty dating back family generations and the legacy automakers are still figuring out how to bring those enthusiasts along as they electrify their fleets.

Dodge shows its hand

Dodge this week became the first of Detroit's traditional performance brands to announce its plans on how to retain its muscle car customers. At the event in Pontiac Michigan the company showed off its Charger Daytona SRT concept ahead of its first production electric muscle car in 2024. Kuniskis called it one that regulators and environmentalists who support EVs ""don't want you to have"" because of its performance modernized retro styling and new patent-pending technologies. ""It was important to bring back something visually that they were going to look at and go holy s--- they did this right!"" Kuniskis told CNBC this week. Some design aspects of the concept car including an exhaust system and multi-speed transmission are expected to negatively impact the electric range of the vehicle ‚Äì but Kuniskis said that's not something Dodge cares about. He said the point is to make the car feel and drive like a traditional muscle car.

That's critical for auto fans like Josh and Darla Welton who own several vehicles including the infamous Dodge Challenger SRT Demon which some condemned when it was produced because of its power as a street-legal drag racing car. ""To keep the enthusiast you're going to have to have the driver engaged as opposed to having some self-driving autonomous car"" said Josh Welton 44 who was wearing limited-edition ""SRT Demon"" sneakers that were made in partnership with Dodge and Warren Lotas. ""They want to be involved with what's going on."" Pete Seguin a 62-year-old auto technician from Ottawa Ontario was also at the event showing his support for Dodge's SRT Hellcat with an ""SRT"" and a Hellcat logo tattooed on his right forearm.

""I just liked it"" he said of the more than 700-horsepower cars. Still Seguin said he is very supportive of electric vehicles and interested in the Dodge concept car. Dodge confirmed at its events this week that it will discontinue its gas-powered Charger and Challenger muscle cars at the end of next year.

Ford Motor and General Motors have yet to disclose plans for their respective performance brands and vehicles. GM has confirmed it plans to produce hybrid and all-electric models of its famed Chevrolet Corvette sports car in the years to come but Detroit's largest automaker has been mum on the future of the Chevy Camaro which has experienced dwindling sales since a redesign of the vehicle in 2016. Performance enthusiast websites such as Muscle Cars & Trucks have said the company is expected to end production of the Camaro in 2024.

Ford is expected to reveal the next generation of its iconic Mustang car next month but it has not given any notion that the car will be electric as part of its strategy to electrify its ""most iconic nameplates."" Since 2020 Ford has offered an all-electric crossover called the Mustang Mach-E which is the only production vehicle other than the sports car to wear the company's prancing horse logo. ""Dodge really played to its own strengths with its concept"" said Paul Waatti manager of industry analysis at research firm AutoPacific. ""It will be interesting to see what Ford and GM have up their sleeves for this as well. I think Dodge has laid out a pretty good roadmap for these types of cars.""

He said a big challenge for automakers in the shift from today's muscle cars with rumbling V-8s and creating the same type of emotional connection. Representatives for GM and Ford declined to discuss plans beyond what has been announced.

Shrinking market

Sales of Detroit's mainstream performance cars are falling. The current cars enjoyed popularity after the Great Recession peaking at more than 394000 vehicles in 2015 according to industry researcher Edmunds. But sales have declined since including a nearly 50% drop for two-door coupes such as the Challenger Camaro and Mustang.

Many of the vehicles have evolved to offer smaller engines with less power but they can still carry a stigma as noisy gas-guzzling cars. There's also increased competition from automakers outside Detroit including EV makers; a move by consumers away from cars to more practical crossovers; and a potential change in performance culture. ""Performance has definitely felt like it's taken a backseat in recent times in this move to electric cars which have a different type of performance"" said Jessica Caldwell executive director of insights at Edmunds. Combined sales of the Ford Mustang Chevrolet Camaro and Corvette and Dodge Charger and Challenger were down about 35% last year compared with 2015. They were down by 25% from then in 2019 ‚Äì the last year of pre-pandemic automaker sales before they were impacted by ongoing global supply chain problems including a shortage of semiconductor chips.

To keep attracting buyers Detroit automakers will need to ""find a niche and a brand image"" Caldwell said. Ford's Mustang Mach-E for example has done well for the automaker despite taking the form of a larger crossover rather than the sleek muscle car of its gas-powered predecessor. And Dodge's plans at least for now appear to have satisfied at least some of its most loyal fanbase with the Charger Daytona SRT concept. ""When it came rolling out and then you got to see all the lines in the body and design I got chills"" said Darla Welton 43. As a lifelong Detroiter whose family worked in the auto industry she noted the excitement of getting to witness the transition of the muscle cars like the Demon to EVs. ""I can't wait to get behind the wheel"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYXRlc3RseS5jb20vc29jaWFsbHkvd29ybGQvc2hhcmVzLW9mLWdlbmVyYWwtbW90b3JzLXJvc2UtYWZ0ZXItdGhlLWF1dG9tYWtlci1zYWlkLWl0LXdvdWxkLXJlaW5zdGF0ZS1pdHMtcXVhcnRlcmx5LWxhdGVzdC10d2VldC1ieS1yZXV0ZXJzLTQxMDI4NTIuaHRtbNIBqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYXRlc3RseS5jb20vc29jaWFsbHkvd29ybGQvc2hhcmVzLW9mLWdlbmVyYWwtbW90b3JzLXJvc2UtYWZ0ZXItdGhlLWF1dG9tYWtlci1zYWlkLWl0LXdvdWxkLXJlaW5zdGF0ZS1pdHMtcXVhcnRlcmx5LWxhdGVzdC10d2VldC1ieS1yZXV0ZXJzLTQxMDI4NTIuaHRtbC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shares of General Motors Rose After the Automaker Said It Would Reinstate Its Quarterly ... - Latest Tweet,"Shares of General Motors rose after the automaker said it would reinstate its quarterly dividend for shareholders more than two years after suspending the payouts to conserve cash amid a global health crisis https://t.co/cqm3orrqQ7 $GM pic.twitter.com/RZpoKj6IJa‚Äî Reuters (@Reuters) August 19 2022

Ether satisfies all three major criteria for a currency: store of value medium of exchange and unit of exchange. Any currency fits the bill as a payment unit if it fulfills the above three features of money. Store of value is an asset that retains its purchasing power in future. The value could be stable or increase over time but it won't go down. Risk aversion is a key concept behind a store of value and prices rise steadily if there is a perpetual demand for the asset. As a medium of exchange money serves as an instrument that facilitates the sale purchase or trade of goods or services between parties. For settling economic transactions currency is the most common medium of exchange. As a unit of account money should be divisible fungible and countable. Divisibility refers to the division of a unit of account into its component parts which equal the original value. Fungibility is the property where a unit of currency has the same value as any other unit. Ether scores well on all these parameters. ETH is a scarce digital money that is held and exchanged over a blockchain. Units of Ether can be used for measuring the value of goods and services and later for purchase. An individual can use Ethereum for investment purposes as well. They could buy ETH and hold it to redeem in future hoping for an increase in its value.

How to accept payment in Ethereum? Any merchant looking to accept payment in Ethereum needs to take certain steps. A merchant looking to receive payments in ETH needs to set up a payments infrastructure that facilitates transactions in an easy and convenient way. They can create a business account with a payment processor like BitPay Flexa or CoinRemitter and begin accepting ETH through their app. The process usually includes Sign up for a business account. Enter an Ethereum address. Create an API key. Add an integration method (API plugins invoices payment widget or a payment link) to checkout. Start accepting payment in Ethereum. Web infrastructure platform Cloudflare supports the deployment of Ethereum for taking payments through its Ethereum and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) gateways. One can log into the dashboard and configure a zone for Ethereum. Cloudflare‚Äôs Ethereum Gateway enables users to read and access all information validated by the existing nodes on the blockchain without restrictions.

Where to store ETH? Merchants as well as users need a secure and convenient place to store ETH. Depending on factors such as security and convenience one could store ETH in hot or cold wallets. A ‚Äúhot‚Äù cryptocurrency wallet is accessible online and facilitates transactions with the help of public and private keys. On the other hand a ‚Äúcold‚Äù wallet also termed a hardware wallet is a physical item that keeps cryptocurrencies offline. Cold wallets are considered more secure than hot wallets while the latter are more convenient. Most people holding ETH tend to store it in hot wallets which are basically software programs capable of interacting with Ethereum blockchain. Hot wallets include desktop mobile and most exchange custody wallets. Though these wallets make transferring crypto easy they are vulnerable to hackers. For anyone holding ETH in large amounts keeping the bulk of their crypto in a cold wallet while keeping just enough in a hot wallet to execute regular transactions might be an ideal solution. Cold wallets not connected to the internet are at a lesser risk of being compromised compared to hot wallets. A USB drive device used for storing ETH and other cryptocurrencies stores a user's private keys. Anyone holding ETH could also keep it in custody through a paper wallet which they can generate on certain websites. A paper wallet has public as well as private keys regarding ETH on hold.

What are gas costs in Ethereum? Gas costs in Ethereum were exorbitant before the Merge with the Ethereum consensus layer. What has been the impact on gas costs? The concept of gas was introduced in Ethereum to compensate for the computing energy the ecosystem requires to process and validate transactions. All computing requirements for processing a transaction are sourced from miners and the gas fees associated with specific transactions is distributed among the miners involved in block formation. A gas limit indicates the maximum amount of gas one is willing to spend on a particular transaction. A higher gas limit means one needs to spend more to execute the transaction. The cost of gas goes up and down with the supply and demand for processing power. The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) can execute a diverse kind of smart contracts including swaps options contracts coupon-paying bonds bets and wagers employment escrow and more. This enables businesses to collect funds in an automated manner without any human interference. Earlier gas costs in Ethereum shot up when demand was high often to exorbitant levels. After the introduction of the Ethereum consensus layer the issue eased up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDgyMTAwNTAyNC9lbi9FTUwtUmVwb3J0cy1SZWNvcmQtR0RWLU9mLTgwLjItQmlsbGlvbi1BbmQtUmV2ZW51ZXMtT2YtMjM0LjEtTWlsbGlvbi1Gb3ItRlkyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EML Reports Record GDV Of $80.2 Billion And Revenues Of $234.1 Million For FY22,"BRISBANE Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EML Payments Limited (ASX: EML) today released its FY22 Financial Results and Annual Report.

Today‚Äôs result demonstrates the substantial growth opportunities across both EML's global markets and its range of payments solutions and services. However the respective 4% and 1% lower underlying EBITDA and NPATA performance for FY22 underscore the importance of the Strategic Review (''Review'') to be driven by EML's newly appointed Managing Director and CEO Emma Shand.

Ms. Shand who commenced in the role in July this year will lead the Review through September and October with a particular focus on business growth strategy development of a more customer-centric streamlined and strengthened operating model including enhanced compliance and regulatory processes. The Board recognises that improvement is needed particularly in these aspects of the business to underpin reliable growth in both revenue and earnings for shareholders over the next three to five years.

Ms. Shand will present the outcomes of the Review to shareholders at EML's Annual General Meeting in late November this year.

Highlights for the year ended 30 June 2022 include:

Gross Debit Volume ('GDV') of $80.2 billion up 308% on PCP

GDV represents the volume processed by the Group through its proprietary processing platforms indicating demand for its payment services. In the year it saw both organic growth in all segments alongside acquisition growth as it consolidated the Sentenial Group into the Digital Payments segment from 1 October.

General Purpose Reloadable ('GPR') segment organically grew global volumes by 27% to $12.4 billion (PCP: $9.7 billion);

Gift & Incentive ('G&I') segment organically grew volumes by 21% to $1.3 billion as it recovered from the impacts of Covid-19 (PCP: $1.1 billion);

Digital Payments ('DP') segment grew volumes by 654% predominantly through the acquisition of Sentenial which was consolidated from 1 October 2021 to $66.6 billion (PCP: $8.8 billion);

Revenue of $234.1 million up 21% on PCP

The Group achieved record revenue of $234.1 million1 which is growth of 21% on the PCP. The Group benefitted from the introduction of new Account Maintenance Fees ('AMF') on certain European GPR programs where the account has been inactive for more than 12 months. This resulted in revenue of $23.5 million of new AMF income stream and $17.9 million of this is non-recurring related to the inactive cards' back book. Revenue came from:

GPR revenue grew 30% to $148.1 million benefitting from the new AMF revenue stream;

The G&I segment generated $68.4 million of revenue down 3%. This was a positive result noting that the prior comparable period included $11.1 million in elevated breakage rates in the North American business;

The DP segment increased revenue through the acquisition of Sentenial to $17.6 million up 71% on PCP. The Open Banking product Nuapay is strategically important and expected to demonstrate a strong growth profile over the next 10 years;

The Group generated a gross profit margin of 68% up 1% on the PCP

EML's Gross profit margins were 68% as the contribution of General Purpose Reloadable increased relative to the other segments with 57% of gross profit generated from the General Purpose Reloadable segment.

EML expects to benefit in the short to medium term from the expected continuation of interest rate increases by central banks generally. EML holds $2.2 billion in stored value (FY21 $2.1 billion) generating interest income. EML has been impacted by negative interest in Euro balances in the current and previous periods.

Underlying overheads increased 41% to $108.4m (PCP: $76.8 million)

Underlying overheads increased as the Company invested in its European operations to meet regulatory resourcing expectations. Consolidation of Sentenial overheads for 9 months from 30 September 2021 also contributed to this increase.

Underlying EBITDA $51.2 million2 down 4% on PCP

The Group has seen a reduction in underlying EBITDA of 4% to $51.2 million largely reflecting increased investment in EML's European operations.

Strategic Review

Over the six weeks since stepping in as MD and CEO Ms Shand has visited EML's global operations to get first-hand observations on the company's strengths and weaknesses as perceived by both long term and newly appointed management and staff members as well as customers shareholders business partners and importantly key regulators.

''My early conversations with key stakeholders have been very constructive and helpful in shaping my immediate focus. It validates to me that whilst we have a strong base it is time for a proactive strategic review of all aspects of the business'' Ms Shand said.

''From what I have already learned I am highly enthusiastic about EML's growth and value potential. However we won't successfully deliver improved value of those opportunities for our shareholders if we don't take a good hard look at how best to set our operating structure and align our capabilities systems and processes to execute effectively for growth.

We have already taken some early steps to improve operating focus elevate a culture of regulatory compliance to support sustainable growth and in optimising balance sheet strength.

I look forward to reporting the outcomes and initiatives from our strategic review to shareholders at the AGM in November'' Ms Shand said.

The retail landscape is undergoing a seismic shift largely propelled by technological advancements. The global pandemic and the ascent of eCommerce have only intensified the influence of technology. Retailers have leveraged technology innovations to enhance efficiency while remaining steadfast in their commitment to customer centricity. The result? Total experiences that delight both customers and employees.

However the retail journey doesn't stop here. The evolution of customer behavior and technology continues unabated. Retailers are mandated to stay attuned to this evolution to stay ahead of the curve in terms of sales and customer satisfaction.

The future of retail is poised to ride the technology wave further bridging the physical and digital realms. Retailers are looking beyond mere product sales on shelves aspiring to build comprehensive ecosystems that encompass services spanning health finance entertainment and more capitalizing on digitization and technology's ability to offer enhanced accessibility to consumers. In this era of technological transformation barriers between industries are blurring enabling retailers and other operators to seize opportunities rapidly by engaging directly with consumers.

Some of the technologies that are scripting this transformation and will continue to do so in the future are Artificial Intelligence (AI) Augmented Reality (AR) Virtual Reality (VR) Blockchain Internet of Things (IoT) and others. These multifaceted technologies promise to revolutionize both physical and virtual operations and reshape customer relations. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at these modern-day technologies that will undoubtedly shape the future of retail catering to a digital-first digital-only consumer base.

Generative Artificial Intelligence will Drive Customer Benevolence

The ability of Generative AI to work with Large Language Models applying in-context learning to learn from analogy and generate responses based on enhanced understanding of context improved reasoning inference skills and tailored problem-solving capabilities has come out as a potent force for businesses.

Generative AI is a powerful technology that leverages vast datasets to create personalized experiences and optimize various aspects of retail operations. It's not limited to one area but offers multiple benefits across different functions. In content creation and optimization Gen AI autonomously generates and improves product descriptions and copy reducing the need for extensive human involvement. It also excels at providing personalized discounts by analyzing purchase history.

Gen AI extends its capabilities to customer interactions through the development of intelligent bots. These bots go beyond traditional AI bots by generating relevant responses in various formats such as text and visuals based on real-time data. They are efficient in handling customer inquiries and can identify upselling and cross-selling opportunities.

In the context of inventory management Gen AI analyzes multiple data sources including consumer sentiment and competitor data to predict demand accurately. This helps retailers drive sustainability by optimizing supply and delivery preventing inventory deficits and avoiding wastage.

In the instance of supply chain management Gen AI can assist with product configuration in transport ensuring the best possible use of space and safe handling of goods apart from suggesting the most viable transport routes. This ability to optimize the operational aspect of logistics not just saves costs but also augurs well for sustainability reducing carbon footprints and ensuring minimum wastage of perishable and high-value goods.

Gen AI's real-time capabilities also extend to pricing optimization where it can adjust prices based on competitor pricing demand trends and market conditions.

Gen AI can also play a crucial role in fraud detection by identifying counterfeit products unauthorized sellers and fraudulent activities helping retailers save valuable resources and drive sustainability. Similarly the technology can be utilized for product and packaging design optimization reducing material use and encouraging recyclable materials.

The versatility of the technology is already a talking point among retailers around the globe with 92% planning to ramp up their investments in Generative AI as per a GlobalNewswire release.

Immersive Reality will No Longer be a Novelty

Retailers bet big on experience as a major differentiator and try using technology to drive experience as a differentiator. The evolution of Augmented Reality (AR) Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality has thrown open a new paradigm in experience that seamlessly marries the physical with the virtual. The ability to experience furniture fashion and more from the comfort of the drawing room is a relatively new experience one that customers are eagerly absorbing and consuming. According to a survey by PWC India China and Qatar are most keen on VR. The survey states that 32% of users buy products after checking them out on VR platforms. A similar report on AR from NielsenIQ highlights that 56% of customers feel more confident about the product using AR while 61% said they prefer to shop with retailers offering AR experiences.

AR/VR and MR empower retailers to:

The evolving wave of spatial computing that utilizes a range of technologies including AI ML AR and IoT to establish an awareness of the three-dimensional (3D) environment surrounding an object enable it to interact seamlessly with its surroundings is a fast-developing technology poised to take the experience quotient to another level and promise an immersive engaging future for retail consumers and better returns for retailers. The growing influence of immersive technologies is charting the way for retailers into the evolutionary world of the Metaverse. Retail giants like Nike Gucci and Adidas among others have already made a foray into the virtual world by buying real estate building digital stores conducting fashion shows and hosting concerts. The future state of this space holds a lot of promise for retailers as it is expected to create a digital connection between the customer and the brand like never before. Retail brands are excited about the opportunity as it provides them with direct access to zero-party data of customers enabling retailers and service providers to establish a hyper-personalized connection with the customers. The customer is enthusiastic and buoyed by the surreal experience that is being rendered across these new digital platforms which promises to better all previous experiences from the past.

Expanding the Expanse with Omnichannel Integration

Powering the futuristic omnichannel retail ecosystem at the front end will be a headless commerce architecture that delivers a distinctive consistent customer experience across channels and supports all touchpoints with shared functionalities such as wish lists appointment booking and payments. This architecture is also expected to be more scalable and flexible than a traditional monolithic architecture as it is decoupled from the backend giving retailers the ability to drive changes faster. The world is steadfastly embracing IoT in the shape of wearables home automation and more. The headless architecture will help retailers deliver content across each device type without reinventing the wheel keeping the experience consistent. Talking of the backend the move towards a microservices-based architecture at the backend can also be a game changer for retailers. This decoupling of the monolithic architecture at the backend will help retailers to upgrade or revamp a specific function quickly for example integrating biometrics into the sign-in function or integrating gesture recognition for payment. These new-age capabilities can be separately developed and deployed in a modular fashion. This is unlike how it is done in the traditional monolithic architecture where the complete system would need a revamp for the addition of any functionality.

Blockchain Safeguarding Digital Assets Across the Virtual Terrain

Blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger system that provides robust security and transparency for safeguarding digital assets in the retail sector across the digital landscape. Through its immutable and distributed nature blockchain ensures the integrity of transactions and data reducing fraud and enhancing trust. For example in supply chain management blockchain can trace the origin and journey of products allowing customers to verify the authenticity and quality of goods. It also acts as a powerful tool for driving sustainability within the retail sector by providing retailers insight into their supply chains promoting responsible sourcing and reducing waste. By verifying product authenticity blockchain helps combat counterfeiting ensuring that consumers receive genuine quality products discouraging the production of environmentally damaging fakes.

In e-commerce blockchain-based payment systems like Bitcoin offer secure and borderless transactions eliminating the need for intermediaries. Blockchain can also be a game changer in driving loyalty programs enabling retailers to offer customers rewards securely while smart contracts an agreement based on blockchain technology that kicks in automatically once certain conditions are met can enforce credible transparent agreements on product authenticity warranties or refund policies ensuring a seamless and trust-driven retail experience. Blockchain holds significant value in a rapidly digitizing world that is embracing Non-Fungible Tokens or unique digital identifiers recorded on a blockchain ledger as an identification of ownership and authenticity for digital assets such as art music fashion or any other collectible owned by an entity. One of the main advantages of NFTs is that they allow people to own and intellectual property. NFT cannot be replicated a strong reason why fashion labels and multinational retail conglomerates are exploring the use of NFTs to secure ownership of digital assets and thwart counterfeiting.

Embracing the Future of Retail Technology Today

As inflation and fears of an economic slowdown weigh heavy on the minds of consumers curtailing their spending retailers will need to embrace the advances in technology to attract convince and drive sales to build an all-encompassing retail ecosystem. Retailers will need to deploy new-age strategies powered by contemporary technologies such as artificial intelligence blockchain augmented and virtual reality and more to get up close and personal with their customers building long-lasting trust and value. Retailers will have to look at technology not just for delivering convenience and experience but also as a medium to drive sustainability and security. The time is ripe for retailers to embrace the future of technology to catapult from digital transformation to digital ascendance.

Earlier this year I had a heart attack aged 49 completely and utterly out of the blue. And I haven‚Äôt stopped laughing since.

Okay I haven‚Äôt been laughing exactly. But I‚Äôve definitely found humour in my situation which has helped to raise my flagging spirits as I wrap my mind around what happened to me and my newly emerging reality ‚Äì a reality that I share with far more people than I would ever have imagined.

It‚Äôs been almost comical to look back for example on how the doctors fixed my failing heart by inserting a deflated balloon in my right coronary artery through a large vein in my groin using a thin catheter. Once in position they inflated the balloon so that it could clear the offending mess of organic matter that had completely clogged my artery.

The mind reels in wonder and awe.

I was awake during the whole procedure chatting amiably with the lead cardiologist. It turns out we‚Äôre both into cycling. So we talked about the local riding scene while I teetered between life and death.

If that weren‚Äôt enough the doctors then inserted two tiny expandable mesh coils into my freshly plumbed artery. These stents as they are called are there for life. They will keep the blood flowing.

Who needs magicians when these guys are around?

To be sure medical science has come a long way. Had this happened to me 40-50 years ago I‚Äôm told that there is a very good chance I‚Äôd be dead. There‚Äôs humour in that statement somewhere. I‚Äôm sure of it. I certainly laugh nervously when I recount my story to friends and family.

Here‚Äôs another fun fact. I am among about 20 per cent of heart attack patients with none of the classic cardiac risk factors such as high blood pressure obesity diabetes or high cholesterol. Which means nobody can give me a clear answer on why any of this happened. Hysterical.

Turns out that for some people heart attacks are an inevitable life event like birthdays. They come around whether you want them or not. I could have been eating rabbit food from birth and it would have made little difference. Doing so would have only served to deprive me of the singular pleasure of devouring the occasional poutine laden with Montreal smoked meat.

Of course poutine is now completely off the table for me because I can no longer take chances with what I eat. As are all fried foods such as chips and doughnuts. My new diet is a source of great amusement to my 11-year-old who has a gentle teasing nature. I darkly remind him that he shares my genes.

I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reading about my condition which is most commonly referred to as coronary artery disease or CAD. CAD is the buildup of plaque in the heart‚Äôs arteries. Many people have it. The Public Health Agency of Canada says that about 1 in 12 (or 2.4 million) Canadian adults age 20 and over have been diagnosed with the disease.

CAD starts developing early in life. It is in fact so prevalent that some of the cardiologists I have been listening to in podcasts joke around that as a public service the water supply should be secretly spiked with drugs that lower cholesterol. Those guys are funny.

Joking aside I recognize the gift I‚Äôve been given. I‚Äôm still alive which is awesome.

It might be a clich√© to say it but I‚Äôm learning to live in the moment. For me that can mean being more attuned to what‚Äôs happening right there in front of me. It can be as simple as finding pleasure in humdrum activities such as driving my daughter to her early morning swim practices which start at 6:00 a.m. I look forward to teasing her in the car. She‚Äôs not a morning person and always very groggy. This shared moment brings us closer.

I‚Äôm also suddenly enjoying life in ways I didn‚Äôt before and I‚Äôm bringing others along for the ride sometimes reluctantly such as my immediate family. We do post-dinner walks around the neighbourhood which we hardly ever did before. My wife has started calling them the Francoli Family Death March.

I‚Äôve also joined a survivor‚Äôs group. Members like to post uplifting messages. Many are a version of the ‚Äúhang in there‚Äù cat meme that is so common on social media. I decided to post a joke I came across that goes like this: ‚ÄúI had a heart attack in a European bathroom but it wasn‚Äôt major. The doctors say I‚Äôll live to see another bidet.‚Äù

Yup that‚Äôs a serious groaner. But it speaks to my current outlook on life which is to take things day-by-day and to focus on the immediate things I need to do to increase my chances of seeing my next birthday and well beyond.

But ultimately my disease is a very serious matter. It‚Äôs the second leading cause of death in Canada after cancer. So while it‚Äôs fun to look at the lighter side it must be treated with the respect it deserves.

For me that means listening to my body. Don‚Äôt do what I did which was to ignore the symptoms of angina for weeks (e.g. chest pain during exercise) until I ended up being carried out the front door of my house by paramedics in the middle of the night as my wife and kids looked on. That was as far away from funny as you can get.

The opening ‚ÄúBad Romance‚Äù found the singer encapsulated within what seemed to be a combination of a fitted cloak a cocoon and a sarcophagus. She did almost nothing beyond creeping her arms out at odd angles as a phalanx of dancers scurried below her and she still commanded focus with impossible ease.

Lady Gaga doesn‚Äôt have to prove anything to anyone. In a decade and a half she‚Äôs proven her hand at club pop the Great American Songbook and singer/songwriter confessionals and shown her mastery of image creation and provocation before stripping back down to the basics in ‚ÄúA Star Is Born‚Äù all while laying claim to the weirdos art nerds and queer kids of the world. So what‚Äôs left for her to conquer? If Friday‚Äôs sold-out Chromatica Ball Tour date at Fenway Park didn‚Äôt offer any easy answers it certainly showed one of this century‚Äôs greatest pop stars flexing her muscles after four years and several pandemic-fueled false starts.

Unafraid of making herself grotesque for effect she took on the persona of an imperious extraterrestrial queen and snarled her way through ‚ÄúJust Dance.‚Äù The house throb that has fueled much of her most recent material generated an insistent undertow that amplified her power even when she was lying on a concrete slab tilted at 45 degrees like a mad scientist‚Äôs monster for ‚ÄúAlice.‚Äù

She was so tightly wrapped in her ferocious stage persona in fact that when she called out her band at the very end of Act II of her four-act show it was the first time all night that she presented as recognizably human. By the time she reached a satellite stage in the middle of the field for Act IV the fa√ßade had dropped as much as it ever would. She was still Gaga naturally going avant-garde ‚Äî wearing futuristic harlequin garb while playing at a piano molded into twisted surrealistic sculpture ‚Äî for her most vulnerable material like ‚ÄúShallow‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlways Remember Us This Way.‚Äù

The latter song very possibly the great lost Lady Gaga power ballad was built on sympathetic (rather than forced) unity the theme that made her Mother Monster to her fans in the first place. And the spell of that a free-time cabaret-styled ‚ÄúBorn This Way‚Äù and a solo ‚ÄúThe Edge of Glory‚Äù dedicated to everyone affected by the constricting of reproductive rights carried over even through the warbling synth-house jam of ‚ÄúFun Tonight‚Äù and electro-dance rush of ‚ÄúStupid Love‚Äù back on the main stage. Gaga closed with her airplane-movie song ‚ÄúHold My Hand‚Äù over the top in exactly the right rock-ballad ways as she dropped to her knees and shredded herself to bits on the floor. Then she headed to the exit paused to do a Michael Jackson kick and spin and vanished.

GS,Goldman Sachs,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL2luc2lkZS1nb2xkbWFuLXNhY2hzLXNob2NraW5nLXNleGlzdC1idWxseWluZy13b3JrLWN1bHR1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Goldman Sachs' shocking sexist bullying work culture,"When Jamie Fiore Higgins had twins in 2008 she assumed Goldman Sachs would support her breastfeeding. After all an entire Goldman floor was a lactation center with hospital-grade equipment and nursing consultants available around the clock.

The reality was that Higgins‚Äô boss Mike threatened that she might lose a desired promotion if she spent too many hours at the lactation center instead of her desk. Eager to succeed though heartbroken Higgins agreed. ‚ÄúNo breastfeeding‚Äù she said through tears.

But when Higgins had her fourth child in 2015 she chose to use the lactation center to store her breast milk. Goldman didn‚Äôt try to stop her but her coworkers made their lack of support clear.

The first time she returned to her desk after using the lactation center Higgins found a carton of milk placed on her computer. The second time there was a stuffed cow. Another time when she went to breastfeed Higgins heard the distinct sound of a ‚Äúmoo‚Äù coming from male coworkers.

‚ÄúJerry leaned back in his chair his hands cupped on either side of his face as he called out in a deep voice while Vito sat next to him and gestured like he was squeezing breasts‚Äù Higgins writes in ‚ÄúBully Market: My Story of Money and Misogyny at Goldman Sachs‚Äù (Simon & Schuster) out Aug. 30.

Higgins was a reluctant Wall Streeter having graduated from Bryn Mawr in 1997 and hoping to become a social worker. But her Italian-American family in New Jersey nixed that explaining they wanted a return on their investment after paying Higgins‚Äô college tuition. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt take out loans to pay $35000 a year for you to get a $20000 job‚Äù Higgins‚Äô mother said.

She knew what she had to do. Higgins survived the grueling Goldman Sachs training program in 1998 passed her licensing exam and became an analyst. She worked tirelessly the first year doing so well Mike called her the ‚Äúbest . . . we have‚Äù and doubling the bonus she was promised to a staggering $80000.

Between the money and her family‚Äôs insistence she stay on Wall Street her career path was set. But that didn‚Äôt mean she understood Goldman or its employees. She was the hardworking daughter of hardworking immigrants who struggled financially so Higgins was amazed by the ‚Äúpure decadence‚Äù of the company‚Äôs required social gatherings: Cocaine was snorted in bathroom stalls and top-shelf liquors gulped greedily. Employees snacked on $200 seafood towers of lobster tails and king crabs and wolfed down ‚Äúfilet mignon New York strips and double Porterhouses so big they hung off the sizzling plates.‚Äù

8 Higgins was told by her boss that he needed ‚Äúa commercial killer not a class mom.‚Äù

Plus there was sex. One late night in the office her first year Higgins went looking for a report but instead found a young female analyst on her knees fellating a coworker in the printer room. It angered Higgins that she worked so hard to escape her New Jersey past while many Goldman employees treated the job like a birthright. ‚ÄúThey were able to literally d‚Äìk around while their country club parents held their safety nets‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúHere I was cramming for my pitch and they were having sex.‚Äù

At the first Goldman holiday party she attended Higgins saw a drunken division head slouched on a couch straddled by his grinding secretary. On the dance floor her coworker Jerry shimmied with his assistant his wedding ring sparkling as he squeezed her gyrating bottom.

8 ‚ÄúThe Fearless Girl‚Äù statue was meant to symbolize the challenges women face in corporate America. Shutterstock

Higgins found Goldman‚Äôs culture not just oversexed but misogynistic. Her first year Jerry and Vito loudly put together an Excel spreadsheet rating the ‚Äúf‚Äìkability‚Äù of the company‚Äôs newest female employees. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs throw some quantitative analysis on this‚Äù Jerry said. ‚ÄúResearch needs to be done on these ladies. I want tit size ass shape and leg length . . .‚Äù

Such behavior was never punished. Nearly 15 years later one of Higgins‚Äô new bosses was equally demeaning when searching for a new assistant.

‚ÄúNobody too old too ugly too flabby‚Äù he announced to the laughing men on his team. ‚ÄúI want ‚Äôem young high and tight!‚Äù

‚ÄôHere I was cramming for my pitch and they were having sex.‚Äô Goldman alum Jamie Fiore Higgins on her randy coworkers

While Higgins was appalled by the behaviors she witnessed at Goldman Sachs she also flourished there. Mike made his star employee ‚ÄúHigs‚Äù a manager a VP and eventually even a managing director (a position only 8% of Goldman employees reach). At one point her yearly bonus surpassed $1000000.

The first promotion in 2006 seemed to come with a caveat though that Higgins quit having kids. ‚Äú‚ÄòI need total devotion from you‚Äô Mike said. His large brown eyes were on my waist like they were trying to send my womb a message.‚Äù

Meanwhile not everyone was supportive of Higgins‚Äô initial promotion. ‚ÄúThe only reason you got it is because of your vagina‚Äù Vinny snarled.

8 The logo for Goldman Sachs is seen on the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange. Reuters

It was a line Higgins often heard. ‚ÄúMost guys at Goldman assume that women who get promoted either filled a quota or screwed . . . someone.‚Äù

Goldman‚Äôs female employees shared a different story. One told Higgins she was quitting because all the meaningful work was given to the men in the office while another complained about being told she wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúpolished enough‚Äù though the office was filled with brutes telling dirty jokes. Most women shared stories of senior men staring at their breasts offering unwanted shoulder massages or suggesting they get a ‚Äúroom‚Äù for the night.

It wasn‚Äôt even easy being a successful female at Goldman Sachs. When Higgins once took an employee named Eric off an account because he was having an affair with the client he grabbed her by the throat and pressed her into a wall. Her toes were off the ground.

8 Higgins‚Äô job often required nights out with clients.

‚ÄúIf I could I‚Äôd rip your f‚Äìking face off!‚Äù he thundered.

Alerting Mike to the situation Higgins found her boss sympathetic ‚Äî to a point. Mike said he‚Äôd talk to Eric but had no intention of firing him. Eric was a champion golfer and knew all the best courses in the world.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford to lose his golf connections‚Äù Mike plainly told Higgins.

After years of professional success at Goldman Sachs Higgins‚Äô career was sidetracked with the arrival of a new boss Justin in the early 2010s. While bad behavior was common in the Goldman offices one night in Chicago at a work event a drunken Justin slurred a racial epithet at a black bar employee. It was too much even for a loyal worker like Higgins. Back in New York she registered what was supposed to be an anonymous complaint with HR but one which was quickly relayed back to Mike ‚Äî and then Justin.

Never again would Higgins find a sympathetic ear at the office. Even when she told Justin she needed time off after suffering a miscarriage he didn‚Äôt care. ‚ÄúYou were hardly pregnant and it‚Äôs been three days already‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen my wife had a miscarriage she was fine after a few days.‚Äù

When she complained that after nearly 20 years at Goldman she‚Äôd been given her first poor performance review (and her first reduction in bonus money) in 2015 Justin suggested she take down her kids‚Äô pictures from her desk. ‚ÄúI need a commercial killer Jamie not a class mom‚Äù he said.

When she later discovered her review included comments that she was too ‚Äúmotherly‚Äù and had incorporated the opinions of Jerry and Vito Higgins realized what was happening.

8 Higgins writes that it wasn‚Äôt even easy being a successful female at Goldman Sachs.

‚ÄúIt was official: My career and reputation were being sabotaged.‚Äù While she had thrived at one of Wall Street‚Äôs biggest firms for almost two decades she‚Äôd done it against the odds. Bosses like Justin were frequently bonding with their male peers at strip joints on Vail skiing weekends or in Vegas bacchanals but no women were allowed ‚Äî not wives and not even female Goldman employees.

‚ÄúThere was an intentionality behind this madness: to keep the strongest relationships with management and the largest clients and therefore the influence with these types of men. It maintained the old boys‚Äô club and solidified its power‚Äù Higgins writes.

Seeing the writing on the wall Higgins made a plan to work at Goldman long enough to bank two more bonuses. After doing so in 2016 she quit to get more involved with her children‚Äôs lives.

The first morning she didn‚Äôt return to Wall Street Higgins stayed home with four violently ill kids. It was gross she thought ‚Äî but not as gross as Goldman Sachs.

When reached for comment a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe strongly disagree with Ms. Higgins‚Äô characterization of Goldman Sachs‚Äô culture and we decline to respond to anonymized allegations.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vcmVhc29uLmNvbS92b2xva2gvMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9yYW1hc3dhbXktaG8tYW5kLWdvbGRtYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ramaswamy Ho and Goldman,"In Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam lawyer and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy talks about his internship at Goldman Sachs‚Äîan internship that he starts by saying was coveted because Goldman was ""the most elite financial institution in America."" ""You didn't join Goldman as a summer intern for the $1500-per-week paycheck though that wasn't bad. Or for the possibility of a $65000-a-year full-time offer for a 100-plus-hour-a-week job. You did it for the privilege of saying: 'I work at Goldman Sachs.'"" But he soured on Goldman in part because of things like the following incident:

The hallmark event at Goldman Sachs the summer I worked there wasn't a poker tournament on a lavish boat cruise followed by a debauched night of clubbing as it had been at the more edgy firm where I'd worked the prior summer. Rather it was ""service day""‚Äîa day that involved dressing up in a T-shirt and shorts and then dedicating time to serving the community. Back in 2006 that involved planting trees in a garden in Harlem. The co-head of the group at the time was supposed to lead the way. I welcomed the prospect of a full day spent at a park away from Goldman's cloistered offices. Yet when I showed up at the park in Harlem very few of my colleagues seemed interested in ‚Ä¶ well planting trees. The full-time analysts shared office gossip with the summer analysts. The vice presidents one-upped each other with war stories about investment deals. And of course the head of the group was nowhere to be found.

It was supposed to be an all-day activity yet after an hour I noticed that very little service had actually been performed. As if on cue the co-head of the group showed up an hour late‚Äîwearing a slim-fit suit and a pair of Gucci boots. The chatter among the rest of the team died down as we awaited what he had to say. ""Alright guys"" he said with a somber expression as though he were going to discipline the team. A moment of tension hung in the air. And then he broke the ice: ""Let's take some pictures and get out of here!"" The entire group burst into laughter. Within minutes we had vacated the premises. No trees had been planted. Within a half hour the entire group was seated comfortably at a nearby bar that was well prepared for our arrival‚Äîpitchers of beer ready on the tables and all. I turned to one of the younger associates sitting next to me at the bar. I remarked that if we wanted to have a ""social day"" then we should've just called it that instead of ""service day."" He laughed and demurred: ""Look just do what the boss says."" Then he quipped back: ""You ever heard of the Golden Rule?"" ""Treat others like you want to be treated"" I replied. ""Wrong"" he said. ""He who has the gold makes the rules."" I called it ""the Goldman Rule."" I learned something valuable that summer after all.

And Ramaswamy then returns to use this phrase elsewhere in the book.

Of course ""He who has the gold makes the rules"" is a familiar line often labeled ""the Golden Rule"" as a play on the other quite different Golden Rule. Ramaswamy labeled it ""the Goldman Rule"" likewise as a play on Golden Rule.

Then this past Thursday the Ramaswamy formulation appeared in Judge James Ho's concurrence in denial of en banc in Sambrano v. United Airlines. The specific legal dispute at this stage of the case is as so many legal disputes about procedural questions (such as when preliminary injunctions are available in religious discrimination cases when opinions should be labeled precedential and when courts should rehear cases en banc) but the underlying substantive question relates to United Airlines' vaccination mandate and its absence of religious exemptions. Here's an excerpt from Judge Ho's opinion:

If the dissent is right and this case is indeed pathbreaking it's important to understand why. What's new here is not the law but the behavior of industry. Historically corporations typically focus on increasing shareholder value‚Äînot on imposing certain cultural values on others. But that is rapidly changing. I began by imagining a hypothetical employer who doesn't care how productive an employee you might be‚Äîhe insists that you abandon certain religious beliefs he finds offensive whether it's abortion marriage sexuality gender or something else. But here's the thing: What was once hypothetical is now rapidly becoming reality. Examples of this abound. [Citations omitted. -EV] So this case may be the first but I suspect it will not be the last. [* * *] A prominent commentator and former CEO recently expressed ""deep[ ] concern[ ]"" about this ""new model of capitalism"" calling it ""a dangerous expansion of corporate power that threatens to subvert American democracy."" Vivek Ramaswamy Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam 18 (2021). As he explained ""America was founded on the idea that we make our most important value judgments through our democratic process where each citizen's voice is weighted equally rather than by a small group of elites in private. Debates about our social values belong in the civic sphere not in the corner offices of corporate America."" ""[T]here's a difference between speaking up as a citizen and using your company's market power to foist your views onto society while avoiding the rigors of public debate in our democracy."" ""When companies use their market power to make moral rules they effectively prevent ‚Ä¶ other citizens from having the same say in our democracy."" In sum ""it's the Goldman Rule in action. The guys with the gold get to make the rules."" Id. at 18. Not surprisingly many Americans bemoan the impact that this new form of capitalism is starting to have on our Nation's culture. Cf. Oliver v. Arnold 19 F.4th 843 843‚Äì44 853‚Äì54 (5th Cir. 2021) (Ho J. concurring in denial of rehearing en banc); Villarreal v. City of Laredo _ F.4th _ _‚Äì_ (5th Cir. 2022) (Ho J. concurring). My point today is less ambitious: We know what this new corporate trend is doing to employees. It's violating the religious convictions of workers across the country. And in cases like this the injuries are irreparable.

So here's the controversy: Some are claiming that referring to this as the ""Goldman Rule"" is ""antisemitic"" (on the theory that ""Doesn't really matter if he meant to be antisemitic. It is and there's a reason this kind of rhetoric is bubbling up now."") See also here and here (""completely internalized antisemitism"") and here.

I take it the theory is that the label ""Goldman Rule"" is an attempt to condemn Goldman as a Jewish-founded company or presumably to tie the universal principle (""The guys with the gold get to make the rules"") specifically to Jews‚Äîrather than as the passage from the opinion suggests to condemn certain behavior by large corporations generally (such as the not-particularly-Jewish-linked United Airlines).

This strikes me as quite mistaken. One great consequence of America's longstanding relative openness to Jews has been that many Jews have thrived and reached prominence‚Äîin business in politics and elsewhere. When you become prominent enough things become named after you: businesses statutes sayings and more.

Some of them are positive for instance using Einstein as the paragon of genius (though even that might be used sarcastically and negatively). Some of them are neutral or perhaps negative but in a way that doesn't reflect on the author for instance the other Goldman Rule named after screenwriter William Goldman: ""Nobody knows anything"" when it comes to predicting which movies will be successful. Some of them are negative in a way that's critical of their namesakes such as Ramaswamy's Goldman Rule. Some of them are purely descriptive but may be loathed by those who disapprove of their substance. (There's a gun control statute for instance called the Lautenberg Amendment after Senator Frank Lautenberg.)

More broadly some will criticize prominent people and institutions that happen to be Jewish much as they may criticize prominent people and institutions that happen to belong to other groups. That will include people and institutions that are associated with businesses that for various reasons have been disproportionately Jewish (including for instance finance) precisely because lots of Jews have become prominent in those fields and there are thus more Jewish-linked institutions in those fields that merit comment whether negative positive or neutral. Recall Ramaswamy's story: He went to Goldman precisely because it was seen as so ""elite.""

And of course such institutions shouldn't be immune from criticism any more than institutions associated with other groups. It's just as legitimate to criticize Mark Zuckerberg as Jack Dorsey and just as legitimate to criticize Goldman Sachs as any other business (or as some people back in the day criticized the Rockefellers or J.P. Morgan or the like). And unsurprisingly Goldman Sachs is routinely harshly criticized at least as often from the Left (see e.g. this Bernie Sanders anti-Goldman-Sachs ad and many of these articles in The Nation to choose just one Left publication) as from the Right. Ramaswamy's ""Goldman Rule"" is pretty tame compared to some such criticisms. Will some anti-Semite listeners or readers endorse such criticisms because of their own preconceived anti-Semitic notions? Doubtless so. But the stupid reactions of some stupid people don't make it improper for us to engage in legitimate criticism (though of course one can always disagree with that criticism on the merits).

Now to be sure someone who hadn't read Ramaswamy's story might wonder ""Why is Ramaswamy calling it the 'Goldman Rule'?"" But thankfully we live in an era where all human knowledge is on a small box in each of our pockets. A few keystrokes will let you search for ""ramaswamy 'goldman rule'"" and there you have the answer: Ramaswamy thought Goldman was elite decided his idol had feet of clay and then used the coincidental similarity of ""Goldman"" and ""Golden"" as a way of criticizing what he saw as overstepping by business generally (and not by the way just financial businesses which are more associated with Jews than corporate America generally). Judge Ho quoted part of Ramaswamy's criticism in the process quoting Ramaswamy's label.

Seems quite reasonable to me (though again one can argue whether that criticism is indeed apt in this situation). There really is real anti-Semitism out there regrettably. This isn't it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2lmdGVkLmV1L2FydGljbGVzL2V2cmVuc2VsLWNhcGl0YWwtcGFydG5lcnMtYXRoZW5hLWFudGhvbnktbW9vcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LinkedIn influencers a ‚Ç¨5bn loan and the goddess of wisdom: the story of the mystery fund that never delivered,"Last August Claire Walsh was looking for support for her startup an ethical investment platform when Louise McCarthy‚Äôs profile caught her eye.

When she reached out to ask advice from the 56-year-old businesswoman ‚Äî who lists Bain HSBC and Aviva on her CV ‚Äî she got an even better response than she expected. McCarthy was setting up a fund to back female-founded companies and Walsh‚Äôs startup looked like a match.

‚ÄúI sent a pitch deck and within three weeks Louise said they would fully fund us"" Walsh said. ""It felt too good to be true and I'm the first to say if something sounds too good to be true it probably is.‚Äù

Nearly a year later that money has still not arrived.

What follows is the mysterious story of how Walsh and more than a dozen other female founders and extremely qualified advisers got caught up in the plans for a new ¬£10m fund that ultimately hasn't delivered any money at all.

The bizarre scheme leads back to an ex-Goldman Sachs septuagenarian living in Istanbul and an investment company with an opaque track record and interests from gold to hospitality. It‚Äôs a cautionary tale about due diligence ‚Äî and a sad reminder that the most vulnerable founders are often the ones left in the lurch.

The birth of Athena

When it comes to diversity tech is in the stone age. In Europe just 1.1% of funding goes to startups led by only women ‚Äî a percentage that‚Äôs actually grown worse in recent years. The VC industry‚Äôs systemic bias against women is well-documented.

It‚Äôs a number that McCarthy is very passionate about as she told Sifted on the phone in early August. The self-described LinkedIn influencer ‚Äî she has more than 35k followers ‚Äî has worked at many international corporates and currently serves as a non-executive director and adviser for several companies.

‚ÄúAs a woman in business and an entrepreneur myself I understand the huge challenges that female entrepreneurs face because I have experienced them throughout my entire career‚Äù she told Sifted later in an email.

She met investor Anthony Moore (who has nearly 23k followers himself) through LinkedIn more than a year ago. Turkey-based Moore is a financier whose current company Evrensel Capital Partners (ECP) says it invests in sectors like the environment and hospitality.

ECP's areas of focus taken from the ECP website.

He told her he would back her in setting up a VC fund to invest in female founders. No matter that McCarthy didn't have any investment experience ‚Äúher business experience was vastly more important‚Äù Moore told Sifted in one of more than 16 emails sent to our reporters in August. McCarthy who Sifted also spoke to on the phone and over email told Sifted she has 35 years of experience working with female entrepreneurs.

The female founders are found

Quickly women like Walsh were introduced to the nascent fund some through shared work experience with McCarthy and others through mutual connections starting in August 2021. The 11 people that Sifted spoke to for this piece say that founders and advisers were reassured by McCarthy‚Äôs LinkedIn connections and the quality of the founders and advisers ‚Äî with backgrounds in investing startup building and at multinational corporates ‚Äî who were joining the group.

The majority of the people Sifted spoke to declined to be named for fear of the consequences and over concerns that it might make it hard to raise money.

According to a presentation seen by Sifted the fund planned to invest ¬£10m across more than a dozen companies at seed to Series A stage and would write cheques from ¬£500k to more than ¬£1m. People that Sifted spoke to say that the source of the funds was not made clear. Moore told Sifted that it was supposed to come from a loan to ECP ‚Äî more on that later.

‚ÄúI felt that Louise McCarthy in the beginning was very credible. She was a well-known real person and she had also worked previously with two of the people involved who I felt were credible people. I thought that she had no reason to put forward something that isn‚Äôt real‚Äù said one founder who was offered funding that she ultimately declined.

Before details were given about funding the participants were added to a WhatsApp group. McCarthy encouraged everyone to help come up with a name and a logo for the fund. They settled on Athena Ventures ‚Äî after the goddess of wisdom.

The Athena Ventures logo taken from a pitch deck.

Weekly check-ins began. So did talks by industry experts in risk management insurance and executive coaching according to people Sifted spoke to all of which ran throughout late 2021 and early 2022. No one had an Athena email address including women that McCarthy had slated to take investment committee positions. McCarthy hadn‚Äôt even signed a contract with Moore‚Äôs asset management company she said. And barely any due diligence had been done on the startups themselves.

‚ÄúIf you had a positive conversation with [McCarthy] she would immediately put you in a WhatsApp group and she‚Äôd put you in the pitch deck. She‚Äôd make it real‚Äù said the founder who ultimately declined Athena funding.

But the somewhat ragtag setup didn‚Äôt matter because things were happening.

‚ÄúLouise had this fancy-looking PowerPoint deck [about Athena]. If it all came to fruition it sounded fantastic‚Äù said Walsh. She said that at the beginning of September 2021 she was told that she would get the money and then signed terms that included clauses limiting her ability to raise from other investors for some time.

Term sheets ‚Äî the document signed by an investor and founders setting out the terms of the investment ‚Äî can include temporary exclusivity clauses. The people Sifted spoke to said that term sheets issued by Athena restricted their ability to speak to other investors about investment for as long as three months.

McCarthy insists that the documents were memorandi of understanding and thus not legally binding. (Term sheets are indeed not binding.) Moore told Sifted that he was not aware of exclusivity clauses. ‚ÄúAnyone can raise money from whomsoever they wish. That said we will not invest alongside VCs.‚Äù In a call with Sifted Moore said that he felt VCs brought little value to companies.

Athena promised the founders more than just money according to the people who spoke to Sifted and a presentation seen by Sifted. It implied that Athena would provide the portfolio an additional ¬£5m to be spent on support services in areas such as legal and accounting ‚Äî some provided by Athena and some by friendly suppliers.

‚ÄúShared services were on the agenda but nothing was agreed as Athena did not receive funding‚Äù Moore told Sifted.

While some other early-stage VCs and accelerators also refer portfolio companies to friendly suppliers it can be difficult for startups to verify whether or not the cost of the services quoted is in line with the market or is high quality investors say.

Concerns and uncertainty about the money

Some participants in the Athena group became uneasy about the funding once they started looking for more information about Moore's company ECP. Several even started to drop out as early as September and October 2021.

McCarthy said that Moore kept reassuring her that the money was coming but used excuses like delays with the source of the funding including Know Your Customer checks. Moore told Sifted that the failure to deliver funding was ‚Äú100% due to a lender breaching a legally binding agreement‚Äù.

One piece of information that concerned some Athena participants was the fact that ECP had promised to invest ¬£250k in a UK medical device company TruSpine Technologies which said in April 2021 that the capital never came through.

Sifted reached out to TruSpine for comment but the firm declined to add anything more than is publicly known. Moore said that the reports about TruSpine were ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù and that the funds never came through ‚Äúfor various reasons of which the company is well aware‚Äù.

Meeting Moore

Other things made the Athena participants wary such as legal documents and a hectic first meeting via video call with Moore in Istanbul in autumn 2021. Four people who were present said that the investor dialled in from a noisy outdoor location in Turkey. He could barely hear the participants and they could barely hear him.

Moore said he was not aware of the circumstances of the meeting and that he ‚Äúwould have apologised for the noise"".

‚ÄúI had several calls with Athena people. They were most enjoyable and feedback was very good.‚Äù

Walsh said: ‚ÄúWhen you did question things we were told we were a small part of something bigger. We were told they were looking at much bigger deals of hundreds of millions.

‚ÄúI had concerns all the way along but it was hard to see why they would lead us on and Louise was adamant Athena would get things sorted by Christmas. My cofounder and I scheduled Christmas dinner together to celebrate getting the money.‚Äù

But by the end of 2021 the money had still not come.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt draw the line. It was a sunk cost fallacy. Because I was six months pregnant and thinking 'What other options do I have to raise?' And they were still saying that the money would come through‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúLike a fancy bottle of wine‚Äù

76-year-old Moore is a larger-than-life character who's been described by Indian media as a ‚Äúking in the financial market‚Äù who is ‚Äúlike a fancy bottle of wine that is only more treasured with time‚Äù. Moore also sent Sifted reporters a photo of a limited-edition coffee table book about him from his Huawei phone. He said hard copies are being dispatched but aren‚Äôt for sale.

Those familiar with Moore say he talks frequently about his Goldman career where he was a VP from 1983 to 1991 though he never rose to the ‚Äúexecutive suite‚Äù at the firm. Goldman confirmed the years of his employment.

Moore‚Äôs company ECP was registered in Jersey in 2019 and invests in dozens of disparate areas and across continents according to its website and to Moore himself.

‚ÄúECP is not a fund and therefore has no AUM [assets under management]. We are a global corporate advisory investment and trading company. We seek to raise loan capital into ECP which we then invest ‚Äî equity or debt ‚Äî at our discretion. Startups are a limited area of interest for us and media even less so. Renewable energy waste management hotels and hospitality and mining are far higher on our list of priorities‚Äù Moore said in an email.

ECP‚Äôs website says there are 21 companies in the ECP group. Athena is one of them. The others span everything from ECP Hydrogen dedicated to hydrogen research; ECP LatAm which owns and manages South American rainforests; ECP-CCX a crypto exchange; and ECP Mongolia a gold mining operation.

One person worked as a project manager for ECP after being drawn in by the impressive roster of advisers listed on the website ‚Äî 29 at last count before they were removed from the website once Sifted started reporting. The person asked to remain anonymous for fear of consequences. Moore put this person in charge of multiple projects and promised them a budget.

Just like in the Athena case none of it materialised. ‚ÄúFrom my knowledge ECP has not done a single deal‚Äù the person said. ‚ÄúThey promised me shares in the company I was promised a salary that never came.‚Äù

Moore told Sifted that he did promise funding for projects but that it was dependent on a loan to ECP being agreed upon. He said many ECP employees have received shares in the company.

The project manager said he was told that money for the projects was coming from a Saudi investment firm. When the wait went on too long he said he grew suspicious and eventually left the firm. Moore told Sifted that ECP had been in talks to secure funding from Saudi Arabia but that the investor declined to pursue the deal.

When asked about deals that ECP has completed Moore said that there were ‚Äútoo many to list here. We are currently in the middle of three very significant gold trades‚Äù. He said that ECP does not pay salaries ‚Äî to anybody ‚Äî but that ‚Äúeveryone is there to share in the upside‚Äù.

Another person Sifted spoke to said that Moore had asked them to be an adviser and had added them to the website without asking. Moore denied that he had ever added anyone to the ECP website without their permission.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen proof that Evrensel has a fund. It‚Äôs talked about and it‚Äôs hyped up and they have many many advisers a very surprising amount of advisers actually but I haven‚Äôt seen anything of substance‚Äù another person familiar with ECP told Sifted. Moore denied that ECP is a fund.

Advisers listed on the ECP website currently include people with work experience at Macquarie and Huawei.

Sifted did speak to one founder who received funding from ECP. The person said they were pleased with the work ECP had done though added that there were times when funds came through late.

A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing from more than a decade ago shows Moore was ordered to pay $25k to the US Treasury for violating certain sections of securities law. At that time Moore was running another fund MCC Global NV which was listed in Frankfurt.

‚ÄúWe were reprimanded. Importantly I was not banned from being a director of a public company or indeed a company in the same industry. The fine in SEC terms was very small. For those who understand SEC rulings it indicates that the punishment was minimal. There is no dispute and the matter is now beyond the 10-year statute of limitations. No criminal offence and I have assumed many directorships since that time‚Äù Moore responded.

The ‚Ç¨5bn that didn‚Äôt arrive

Many of Athena‚Äôs early participants pulled out in the autumn of 2021 but others held on until spring this year. They said that McCarthy continued to assure them that the funding would come through though deadlines kept changing.

On April 1 McCarthy cancelled the weekly check-ins and told participants they should look for other funding options according to text messages seen by Sifted.

When asked by Sifted why the money didn't come through she said that ECP had ‚Äúa change in their financial conditions and they lost their funds‚Äù.

Later that month McCarthy was featured in a podcast talking about Athena: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not giving them a bit of money it‚Äôs giving them all the money they need wrapping our arms around them and providing them with mentorships support coaching and everything they need to make their business a success.‚Äù McCarthy declined to answer whether the podcast was recorded before or after she told the Athena founders to seek alternative forms of funding.

Moore said that a lender had promised to provide a 10-year loan of ‚Ç¨5bn part of which would have gone to fund the Athena companies. He said that the first funds were due in mid-November but did not arrive.

‚ÄúVarious reasons were given for non-delivery. As the lender expressed feelings of guilt embarrassment and made commitments and promises to make amends I let the matter ride for several months‚Äù said Moore in an email adding that ECP is ‚Äúabout to launch a claim of alleged breach of contract‚Äù.

Moore declined to confirm the identity of the lender. Moore told Sifted that ""no guarantees were ever given about delivery and that it was always clear that the ability to provide funding was dependent in raising investment capital into ECP"".

Moore said ECP was trying in the meantime to raise $50m in debt. Sifted saw a fact sheet included below advertising the raise to high-net worth individuals corporates family offices and private banks to invest in Series A and Series B startups ‚Äî slightly later stage than the startups involved in Athena.

The months of delay meant that Athena founders who had chosen to stick it out had lost valuable time they could have spent fundraising elsewhere. Some even hired suppliers and staff based on the assumption that they would receive funding.

The experience of Athena Ventures highlights the vulnerability of early-stage founders who often struggle to find funding. Even more concerning: the Athena Ventures experience doesn't seem to be an isolated one. Sifted spoke to at least seven women who had similar experiences where they were promised money by investors that never arrived.

‚ÄúIf you get the sense that something may not work for you you can‚Äôt be afraid to withdraw from it. That‚Äôs a tough decision to take. But actually many of us did take that decision‚Äù said the founder who chose not to go ahead with Athena funding.

‚ÄúThis is not a story of how all the women got fooled. This is a story of: the homework worked the due diligence worked. Some people stayed in and some people had a very unfortunate outcome.‚Äù

As for Claire Walsh she has since moved on from her startup and is busy raising her child. But the question remains over what all those hours of calls with lawyers and camaraderie-building meetings with female founders meant.

‚ÄúI feel angry and disappointed"" she said. ""They obviously lied to us. I don‚Äôt know why or what they were doing.‚Äù

McCarthy told Sifted she was disappointed and saddened that ECP had not been able to secure the funding it had been promised. She told Sifted on the phone she would be going to support women in Indonesia later this year.

‚ÄúI feel totally let down my route now to tackle (the problem) is through charity work.‚Äù

As of August 19 her GoFundMe had raised ¬£415.

Moore on the other hand denied he had lied to anyone and still contends that the Athena money will come through.

Quantum research today means big business. What was once seen as a scientific curiosity quantum computing now promises to transform many aspects of everyday life from cybersecurity to drug development and weather forecasting. In recent years work in quantum computing has begun to move out of universities and into corporate research labs with large multinationals as well as start-ups and venture capitalists entering the race to commercialize quantum technologies. But for all the record funding announcements and hype some warn that this is fostering a ‚Äúquantum bubble‚Äù that may soon pop.

The heart and soul of a quantum computer are quantum bits or qubits. These are different from standard computer bits which can be either 0 or 1. Qubits on the other hand can be both. Using this feature for complex computational problems means it could be possible to calculate solutions much faster than today‚Äôs fastest computers by scaling computing to calculate with many qubits resulting in exponential increase in computing power. Qubits can be made from different hardware platforms such as superconducting qubits or trapped ions. Other upcoming methods are photonic quantum processors that use light instead.

Experts say that a real ‚Äúquantum advantage‚Äù can only be expected when quantum computers operate with a million qubits. And with the current record still below 100 qubits there is still some way to go. But what is mostly hindering progress is the decoherence of the qubits themselves. To avoid this they usually have to be operated at near 0 K and shielded from each other and the environment. Scientifically however there is nothing stopping the creation of large-scale quantum computers but there are some tough engineering problems to solve.

Some of those challenges are being met by huge government programmes. In the US the government is putting $1.2bn into its National Quantum Initiative programme that is aimed at both academia and the private sector while the UK government is nearing the end of its 10-year ¬£1bn National Quantum Technology Programme which began in 2013. Meanwhile the Netherlands funnelled ‚Ç¨615m last year into the umbrella organization Quantum Delta NL to foster the development of quantum technologies. This all stands in the shadow however of China‚Äôs $10bn estimated funding for its national programme.

From big tech to small tech

Quantum computing is currently dominated by tech giants such as IBM Amazon Hewlett Packard Honeywell Google and Microsoft with some of these investing heavily in quantum initiatives. Google has a 53-qubit quantum processor named Sycamore while IBM unveiled its plans to produce a 433-qubit chip later this year and a 1121-qubit chip in 2023. IBM quantum devices have already been made available for use by more than 200000 clients via a cloud-based service.

Indeed many large corporations are exploring quantum applications. Goldman Sachs is developing quantum optimization algorithms to price assets based on the inherent risk associated with for example different options or stocks. It says that financial operations could already benefit from quantum computers in the next five years. Car manufacturer Daimler meanwhile is investigating how quantum computers can simulate new materials for the development of higher-performing and lower-cost car batteries. HSBC bank announced last April a partnership with IBM to study the potential of quantum computing in banking.

And it is not just the big players that are in the game. The number of quantum-based start-ups has been on the rise for several years with 265 according to the latest estimate from Quantum Computing Report. And some are making big steps forward. US-based start-up ColdQuanta launched a 100-qubit processor based on cold atoms this year and hopes to upgrade to 1000 qubits in the next three years. Another US company ‚Äì IonQ ‚Äì was the first quantum start-up that began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange last year which allowed it to raise well over $600m in investment funding. Another significant deal features PsiQuantum which secured a $450m round this year based on its promise to build a full-scale photonic-based quantum computer by 2025.

Given that there is a solid scientific foundation underpinning the potential of quantum technology the question is not if it will happen but when Freeke Heijman

Quantum-based start-ups are also attracting the interest of venture capitalists. This is slightly counterintuitive as venture capitalists typically bet on ‚Äúsafe horses‚Äù which is not the case with commercial products that are expected to hit the market a decade or so from now. Nonetheless according to the consultancy firm McKinsey venture capital and other private capital now make up more than 70% of quantum technology investments. And where only $93.5m was invested in 2015 in 2021 that figure had risen to a staggering $3.2bn.

The danger of all this investment is that it leads to a bubble but that it not worrying some at least for now. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe there will be a general crash of investment because in the next few years we will see successes being announced and organizations using quantum computing for real-world commercial or scientific applications‚Äù says Doug Finke who runs Quantum Computing Report.

Freeke Heijman director of ecosystem development at Quantum Delta NL adds that a little bit of hype is not necessarily bad as it will help to excite people to go into quantum technologies. ‚ÄúGiven that there is a solid scientific foundation underpinning the potential of quantum technology the question is not if it will happen but when‚Äù she adds.

With 20 seconds left on the clock with Lakota West leading by three points against St. Xavier the 2023 Ohio State football safety commit was called for targeting lowering his shoulder and his head and knocking down the St. Xavier target for an incomplete pass.

After the play Hartford collected his helmet which fell off during his tackle and walked off the field as four flags were thrown giving St. Xavier 15 yards on the penalty.

""I feel bad for the young man at the end"" Lakota West coach Tom Bolden said. ""The hit it was uncalled for. Malik's just trying to play hard but you can't do that in football.""

St. Xavier missed a 47-yard field-goal attempt at the end of regulation leading to the Firebirds' first win of the 2022 season.

Hartford one of seven captains on Lakota West heading into the 2022 season is following in the footsteps of former teammates Tegra Tshabola Jackson Kuwatch and Jyaire Brown and will join Ohio State in January as an early enrollee.

Across town at Wolcott Park Les Milch hit the courts donning a shirt that read ‚ÄúSome grandpas take naps real grandpas play pickleball (then take a nap).‚Äù

After finishing a game Chuck Pirrello shared that he chose his West Hartford home based on its proximity to the pickleball courts.

For enthusiasts pickleball is more than a pastime ‚Äî it‚Äôs a culture.

As pickleball‚Äôs popularity grows West Hartford has emerged as a hub for public play in the capital region. This month the town opened six new pickleball courts doubling its available play space.

On sunny mornings and lamp-lit evenings West Hartford‚Äôs pickleball courts draw teenagers to octogenarians. Some live in town others travel from nearby to enjoy camaraderie and competition.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a really inclusive sport. You find people of all ages and many different ethnic backgrounds‚Äù said Peter Qoo. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to arrange a date with anyone. I don‚Äôt need to book a court. I can just show up and play‚Äù

Qoo said that he started playing pickleball last year after his wife‚Äôs uncle introduced the couple to the sport.

‚ÄúHe became sort of a zealot and so he proselytized us which I think is kind of common among pickleball players‚Äù Qoo said.

For the last two years the Sports and Fitness Industry Association has recognized pickleball as the fastest growing sport in the country. In February the SFIA estimated that the U.S. has more than 4.8 million pickleball players.

West Hartford Pickleball Club President Ben Reder credits pickleball‚Äôs surging popularity in Connecticut to the pandemic.

‚ÄúThere was an amazing confluence between the rise of the sport and COVID‚Äù Reder said. ‚ÄúI had never played pickleball. I was a squash player as were a lot of the individuals that I started playing pickleball with and all indoor facilities were closed. ‚Ä¶ So we sort of said ‚ÄòHey let‚Äôs try this pickleball thing.'‚Äù

When Reder started the West Hartford Pickleball Club two years ago he said that if he could get 25 people to join it would be a success. Today the club has nearly 300 members.

Reder said that the club which charges a $20 annual membership fee focuses on increasing access and equity in the sport. The club actively works with the town to offer clinics and programs for players looking to expand their skill set.

Reder stressed that the club is open to players at every level not just elites. He said that the sport‚Äôs accessibility is part of the beauty of the game.

‚ÄúIf someone has never touched a paddle and they have a little bit of athleticism you can spend 30 minutes teaching them the game and they can be playing that same day‚Äù Reder said. ‚ÄúI think from that standpoint it has really helped the sort of cult following just because it‚Äôs so easy to get into and the barrier to entry is very low.‚Äù

According to the USA Pickleball Association the sport was invented in the summer of 1965 by Congressman Joel Pritchard and businessman Bill Bell of Washington State.

Determined to quell their families‚Äô summertime boredom they set out to an old badminton court on the Pritchards‚Äô property. But with no racquet or shuttlecock Pritchard and Bell instead picked up what was on hand ‚Äî ping pong paddles and a perforated plastic baseball ‚Äî and the sport was born.

According to the official lore pickleball derives its name from the rowing term ‚Äúpickle boat‚Äù which describes a thrown together crew.

For Cersosimo and Wanda Jones had they not started playing pickleball three years ago they never would have met their new crew ‚Äî a group of women who call themselves the BABs or Bad-Ass-Babes.

‚ÄúWe have this group of 13 and had it not been for pickleball we would not have been together‚Äù Cersosimo said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre from all different backgrounds and different interests. And when the 13 of us are together it‚Äôs like we‚Äôve been together forever. We‚Äôre like sisters.‚Äù

Cersosimo and Jones said that the group has extended its activities to bowling trivia nights and pool parties but they still go out to the courts nearly every day to play with the rest of the West Hartford pickleball community.

‚ÄúIt is a culture. It‚Äôs a healthy happy atmosphere of a culture that you should embrace if you want to learn to play‚Äù Cersosimo said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just fun.‚Äù

So so I can see why they did menasor first the combiner Wars 1 wasn't available outside a lot of places apart from the US in Canada and people have gone to the cartoon looking one from hastak for years. SSo it would only make logical sense the next one would be superior on although the combiner Wars one is pretty good and like menasor I think my only bone of contention is the the ear prongs I really need to get an upgrade kit. WHY ANSWER HOWEVER Where's I think they will either class this little volcanicus as as the next combiner and then get lazy and do a repaint+reetool for road Caesar we've already got so many characters already which while they still look like an awesome toy if it was just looking at them on the shelf not knowing the history clampdown point blank burnout road rocket Minerva crasher leo convoy (prime) with this direction I can easily see a road Caesar happening it might be exclusive but I can see it happening and we won't see another big combiner until the third part of this trilogy. So so it would make perfect sense to do do superion and I would buy again happily even after all the hassle I had to go to any UK to get hold of it air raid (god's waves 1 and 2 of combiner water a cluster **** in the UK) II don't really know whether I want to be right or wrong on this. Speaking of repaints I wish they'd grab that Kingdom rodimus or maybe that holiday Optimus or maybe we can bind them together and do their magic on it and turn it into a thunderclash. Is another thought if that holiday Optimus really is a new mould does anyone think it's going to be by the mouldy used for studio 86 Optimus prime

18 hours ago BenD said: While I like Menasor been there done that. Lets get updates of Monstructor/Dinoking Liokaiser Road Ceaser or even Landcross. I would also welcome something completely new. How about a new theme/team. Autobot water team to stand up against Prianacon or Autobot counterparts for Devestator or Predaking. There was supposed to be one more Scramble City style combiner that never got made. It was based on dinosaurs. It had a T-Rex for the body a pterodactyl and dimetrodon as arms with an ankylosaurus and styracosaurs as legs The retro G1 Fansproject combiner was kind of very loosely based on it. Or at least just the concept of one more combiner in that style and the ankylosaurus. There were also other combiners that didn't get made as well but that was the only Scramble City style. So Hasbro could go back to some of those unused original ideas and make a new combiner out of them. They're described at the bottom of this page: />

The Autobot counterpart to Devastator is technically Omega Supreme. However that kind of sucks as it means they have to be roughly in scale with each other like I said in my comment. I think Raiden was truly meant to be the rival to Devastator in Diaclone. They were made at the same time and are very similar with both being six member teams that use a lot of kibble. They're rivals in The Headmasters too. Trains vs construction vehicles make a lot of sense.



For Predaking his rival is officially Sky Lynx but again that sucks for the same reasons it sucks for Devastator and Omega Supreme. I know people hate the idea for whatever reason but this is where a Dinobot combiner should be used. They're a team with no rival and there's five of them. Devastator was kind of their rival but not really. So make them combine and they can take on Predaking. Weren't they rivals in the Prime Wars Trilogy? I never watched the shows but I think the bios had them as rivals.



And reissuing a character has never stopped Hasbro or Takara from remaking them. Making them has never stopped Hasbro or Takara from remaking them. Ironhide is a very good example of that right now. What about Impactor too? Dude got four figures all from the same base mold in the same base colors. That was entirely uncalled for. G1 Arcee is another one. Platinum edition T30 Arcee wasn't that long ago then we got Earthrise/Kingdom Arcee and now SS86 Arcee.



As for anything not appealing to an audience that's not really the problem. Hasbro still insists that the fans are a small part of the sales. So all Hasbro would need to do is just to market them correctly. If they go back and use an ""obscure"" combiner then make sure to put it in some current media that they're trying to push. Be it the comics or one of the new shows. As it is all combiners for the most part are ""obscure"" as they're not really pushed or featured heavily. People are currently loving Cybertron Metroplex so ""obscure"" is in right now. Hasbro is officially going ""obscure"" with Legacy for the future too. So now's as good a time as any.

Lore Keeper 2022-08-22 @ 2:49 am

Definitely want to see a proper Liokaiser. All the Scramble City guys have been done well enough. The only one I felt was severely lacking was Menasor and we just got a new version of him. A proper Liokaiser with all six members (bonus points for a swap-in Deathcobra) would be an absolute grail for me.

Hasbro recently became quite fond of releasing figures on old Toy Biz-styled cards and now it‚Äôs Ghost Rider‚Äòs turn. Though this figure doesn‚Äôt glow in the dark like every figure in that line used to. This Ghost Rider figure appears to use body parts from prior figures like the AIM trooper but comes with alternate gloved and skeletal hands flaming Johnny Blaze head and the fiery chain that‚Äôs his signature weapon.

This Ghost Rider also comes with flame effects to wrap around his wrists. Given that that‚Äôs way more than the usual two accessories he‚Äôll probably come at a premium price. For now though all we know is preorders begin sometime next month.

At Comic-Con Hasbro‚Äôs Marvel team strongly hinted that the next HasLab will have ties to Ghost Rider somehow. So getting Johnny Blaze out ahead of the big-ticket item seems smart. Fans currently speculate that the Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider with his flaming car seems the likeliest contender. Other Ghost Riders generally ride cycles that can sell at affordable retail prices.

The round brings Incredible Health‚Äôs total funding to date to $97 million and raises its valuation to $1.65 billion.

Founded in 2017 the company ‚Äúputs nurses in the driver‚Äôs seat‚Äù Iman Abuzeid Incredible Health‚Äôs CEO and co-founder said in an interview. Hospitals apply directly to nurses rather than the other way around.

On the platform hospitals get matched with permanent nurse hires in an average of less than 14 days compared to the industry average of 82 days according to Abuzeid. She said an interview request is sent from a healthcare employer to a nurse every 30 seconds.

Abuzeid also claimed that Incredible Health is the only platform that uses automation to help screen nurses‚Äô credentials and employment preferences. The company‚Äôs algorithms recognize more than 70 specialties and 250 skills including specific intensive care unit and operating room skills.

The San Francisco-based startup charges employers for the use of its platform but nurses use it for free. About 10000 nurses join Incredible Health every week Abuzeid declared.

BioPharma BioLabs Pegasus Park Cultivates Life Science Ecosystem Gabby Everett the site director for BioLabs Pegasus Park offered a tour of the space and shared some examples of why early-stage life science companies should choose North Texas.

She added that 600 hospitals use Incredible Health for staffing including Kaiser Permanente Stanford Health Care HCA Healthcare Providence Johns Hopkins Medicine Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and NYU Langone Health. Each hospital location that uses the platform saves at least $2 million per year in costs for travel nurses overtime and human resources according to Abuzeid.

While Incredible Health indirectly competes with job boards such as Indeed and LinkedIn Abuzeid claims her company is the only healthcare job matching platform that considers nurses‚Äô credentials and preferences before matching them with an employer. She also said that Incredible Health has an advantage over traditional nurse recruitment agencies that do not use automation software for scale and speed.

The company also differentiates itself from other venture-backed healthcare staffing companies such as Nomad Health and IntelyCare because it is focused on filling permanent positions instead of temporary staffing Abuzeid said.

The company‚Äôs funding comes at a critical time ‚Äî more than 10000 registered nurses left the workforce in 2021 the worst exodus the profession had seen in more than four decades. Even though this employee deficit is dire Abuzeid argues ‚Äúthe processes tools and technology for hiring permanent nurses have not changed in 20 years.‚Äù That is what Incredible Health aims to change she said.

Incredible Health will use the funds it raised to enhance its screening and matching algorithms and expand its services to reach 90% of the country‚Äôs nurse workforce Abuzeid said. The company will also utilize some of the funds to strengthen the professional resources it offers to nurses including educational scholarships skills growth courses and relocation support. Abuzeid added that these features make Incredible Health not just a place for nurses to find jobs but also a place for them to manage their careers.

Going forward Abuzeid said Incredible Health has plans to extend its staffing capabilities beyond nursing to other types of healthcare workers facing critical staffing shortages such as home health aids and laboratory technicians. The company also aims to widen its customer base beyond hospitals to surgical centers and urgent care facilities.

The Hampden Township resident was the inspiration for an action figure designed recently by Cotswold Collectibles of the Dallas Texas area. The organization owned by Greg Brown also coordinated the Hershey Action Figure & Toy Show at the Hershey Lodge and Convention Center on Saturday where the limited-edition action figure was debuted.

The action figure is the latest in an Elite Brigade line of action figures produced by Cotswold Collectibles Brown said. But this is the first one based on a real-life hero.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been super fun‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my favorite project I‚Äôve worked on. I‚Äôve worked on sets for almost 17 years. This was kind of close to the heart.‚Äù

Beck accepted the honor quite humbly. He shies away from considering himself a hero. Instead he sees himself as representing his friends and fellow soldiers ‚Äì especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice.

‚ÄúThat action toy is a symbol‚Äù he said ‚Äúfor all my buddies that fought over there. If it wasn‚Äôt for my buddies giving their lives for me we wouldn‚Äôt have a Bill Beck action figure. If it wasn‚Äôt for their sacrifices I‚Äôd just be another number at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C.

Beck an Army machine-gunner in the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry Regiment fought in the battle of Ia Drang in November 1965. It was the first major military engagement between U.S. Army troops and the North Vietnamese Army and the U.S. troops greatly outnumbered sustained heavy losses.

Beck said he still lives with the harrowing memories of watching his best friends get killed in front of him. He was awarded the Silver Star and Bronze Star for his bravery during the battle.

The story of the battle was told in a 2002 movie starring Mel Gibson which was based on the book ‚ÄúWe Were Soldiers Once‚Ä¶And Young.‚Äù

In 2017 Beck also received the Living Legend Award from the Army Heritage Center Foundation.

The action figure set is titled ‚ÄúBattle of Ia Drang (SP4 Bill Beck).‚Äù Beck saw it for the first time Saturday and said he was impressed with the authentic detail. The set includes fatigues T-shirt insignia boots helmet with cover web belt harness pistol with holster bayonet with sheath field pack canteen with cover hand grenades ammo pouches ammo box and a M-60 machine gun with ammo belt.

The figure comes in a box adorned with an oil painting of Beck and the 7th Cavalry Regiment created by artist Larry Selman of Waynesboro whom Beck calls ‚Äúone of the most gifted illustrators of our time.‚Äù

A Pennsylvania native Selman has had a highly successful career in illustration working with major publishers receiving prestigious awards and being featured in galleries. Among his claims to fame is illustration work on much of the GI Joe Classic Collection packaging.

Selman was raised in a military family which left a lasting impact on him and his work.

‚ÄúI painted every period of American military history and every branch of history‚Äù he said.

Selman has worked with Medal of Honor recipients and other military veterans as he seeks to depict their role in American history.

During one project he was working on about five years ago Selman connected with several surviving soldiers from Ia Drang including Beck. Selman then connected Beck with Brown. The action figure set and box design have been about five years in the making.

‚ÄúBill‚Äôs project is kind of a personal thing‚Äù Selman said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always sort of leaning toward Vietnam because that‚Äôs the era I grew up in.‚Äù He said he reached out to Beck many times during the project to make sure everything was as accurate as possible.

Of all the sets he‚Äôs worked on over the years Brown said he plans to keep this one for himself.

While other sets were more general homages to the different branches of military he said ‚ÄúThis is somebody that we got to really know.‚Äù

The figure comes in a white box that is much like the exclusive line of GI Joe boxes of the 1960s designed by David Howard.

Cotswold Collectibles produced 30 sets for the show and plans to produce 70 more. Options to buy the set should appear on its website GIJoeelite.com early next week.

The toy show has been held in the area since 2018. Brown said this year that vendor spaces had been sold out for a month and there was a substantial waitlist. The show features local vendors as well as vendors from throughout the country. The show focuses on toys and action figures from the 1950s through the 1990s.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very diverse selection‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúVery nostalgic.‚Äù

As he looks forward to continuing his work Brown said he and Selman have already been working on another figure set featuring a Vietnam War veteran in Texas.

‚ÄúWe want to honor these guys‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf this one with Bill takes off maybe we‚Äôll do one a year.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzI3LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvZnJpZGF5LW5pZ2h0LWZvb3RiYWxsL21pbHRvbi1oZXJzaGV5LWJ1eWluZy1pbnRvLXByb2dyYW0tMjAyMi1mbmYtcHJldmlldy_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmMyNy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2ZyaWRheS1uaWdodC1mb290YmFsbC9taWx0b24taGVyc2hleS1idXlpbmctaW50by1wcm9ncmFtLTIwMjItZm5mLXByZXZpZXcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Milton Hershey buying into program 2022 FNF Preview,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.abc27.com/sports/friday-night-football/milton-hershey-buying-into-program-2022-fnf-preview/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzI3LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvZnJpZGF5LW5pZ2h0LWZvb3RiYWxsL21pbHRvbi1oZXJzaGV5LWJ1eWluZy1pbnRvLXByb2dyYW0tMjAyMi1mbmYtcHJldmlldy_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmMyNy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2ZyaWRheS1uaWdodC1mb290YmFsbC9taWx0b24taGVyc2hleS1idXlpbmctaW50by1wcm9ncmFtLTIwMjItZm5mLXByZXZpZXcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbm5saXZlLmNvbS9nYWxsZXJpZXMvQldXSkxTR1FERkJaTlA0UlpKWERQSDdKS0kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Veteran Bill Beck and the Hershey Toy Show - pennlive.com,"6 / 7

This will make Prosus the sole owner of Brazil-based delivery platform iFood.

The acquisition is worth up to EUR1.8 billion. ‚ÄúThe consideration represents an equity multiple of over 5 times on the investments over the life of the joint venture‚Äù Just Eat highlighted.

‚ÄúThe contingent consideration may become payable if the food delivery sector re-rates on a GMV and gross profit multiple basis over the next twelve months‚Äù said Prosus.

As part of the transaction Just Eat will buy IF-JE Holdings BV‚Äôs 49% interest in El Cocinero a Cuerda SA for no additional consideration.

El Cocinero a Cuerda is a holding company of Sindelantal a restaurant delivery app run by iFood that ceased its operational activities in December 2020.

Prosus said: ‚ÄúThe transaction is consistent with Prosus‚Äô strategy to invest where it has high conviction and is a natural next step in the long-standing relationship between Prosus and iFood. Prosus believes this represents a great opportunity to secure full ownership of a high performing cornerstone asset in the attractive Brazilian Food Delivery sector.‚Äù

Just Eat said the deal needs shareholder approval and believes the sale to be in the best interests of the firm.

‚ÄúJust Eat Takeaway.com remains focused on improving its profitability and on a disciplined allocation of capital. It will retain the transaction proceeds to maintain its balance sheet strength and to service repayments of its upcoming debt maturities‚Äù Just Eat said.

The chain has around 7000 properties across six continents and all of them ‚Äî even the most luxurious Conrad and Waldorf Astoria properties ‚Äî can be booked with points.

You're not just restricted to hotel stays. There are other ways to redeem Hilton Honors points that can provide value. So I'll review your options for redeeming Hilton Honors points in this guide.

Redeem Hilton points for hotel stays

Hilton Honors is a hotel loyalty program so naturally you can redeem your points for hotel stays in the Hilton portfolio. Unfortunately the program doesn't provide a published award chart so your only way to know the award price is to search for your dates.

A good starting point though is the program's Points Explorer tool. This tool highlights the maximum award rate of a property as well as the lowest price recently booked by other members. However these ""discounted"" prices tend to come up when cash prices are lower.

TPG pegs Hilton Honors points at 0.6 cents per point. However given the form of variable pricing the program uses this valuation will vary from hotel to hotel.

For example I found a night at the Conrad Washington D.C. that is bookable for $309 with the Hilton Honors semi-flex discount rate or for 80000 Hilton points. You'll get a redemption value of just 0.38 cents per point if you redeem points.

On the other hand some hotels will give you more than 0.6 cents in redemption value. This usually happens when you get to a property's maximum standard award rate (which is now as high as 120000 Hilton points per night). An example on New Year's Eve the Hampton Inn Grand Central in New York City costs $969.69 per night using the Honors discount rate.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

Alternatively you can book the same king room for 70000 points per night giving you a valuation of 1.39 cents per point.

To book an award room start at hilton.com and click ""Sign in"" at the top right. Enter your credentials then click ""Sign in.""

After typing in your city and dates select ""Special rates"" and ensure that you tick the ""Use points"" option. You could also start your search directly from the Hilton Honors homepage and log in later. Again check the ""Use points"" box to see award rates in the search results.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

Select the property you'd like to book from the results page and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the reservation. Just be sure to pay close attention to the individual hotel's cancellation policy. Most award stays are free to cancel until a couple of days before arrival but some properties have stricter policies.

There are a few other options that you can utilize when redeeming Hilton Honors points for a stay. As you go through the booking process keep your eyes out for the following booking options.

Customize your award with the points and money slider

In addition to booking stays completely with points the Hilton Honors program allows you to use a combination of points and money.

Unlike many other programs that use a fixed number of points and cash for this award option Hilton lets you customize the amount using a slider on the final page before confirming your reservation. You'll still select the full award price from the search results but then you can drag the slider to whatever points and money combination you want:

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

Note that there is a 5000-point minimum for points and money redemptions. The combination of points and money you select is final once you book. However you will earn Hilton Honors points on the cash portion of these stays. So if you're short on points or don't want to burn all your points on one stay this can be a nice option.

Redeem points for premium room awards

One of the best things about Hilton Honors redemptions is that you're not restricted to one room type. You can redeem points for premium rooms including those with better views club lounge access or suites.

The booking process is the same. Once you've selected your desired hotel you can choose between a standard room reward and premium room rewards like this example at the Conrad London St. James.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

As you can see premium rooms will cost more points than standard rooms. In some cases (like the above) it's likely not worth it.

However if you're looking for extra space for your family it's great to have the option to burn additional points for a suite or larger room instead of hoping your Hilton elite status will score you an upgrade at check-in.

Fifth night free for Hilton Honors elite members

Anyone with Hilton Honors Silver status or higher gets every fifth night free when booking a standard room reward stay. This perk extends to stays of up to 20 nights ‚Äî during which you'd enjoy four free nights. If you don't have Hilton Honors status consider applying for one of Hilton's American Express cards for automatic status.

Redeem Hilton points for event credits

You can also use Hilton Honors points for a discount on your next Hilton event (but please don't). This can be a wedding corporate event or other types of meetings. When redeeming Hilton points for these discounts you can choose from different denominations of vouchers. Here's how much they cost:

25000 points = $50.

50000 points = $100.

75000 points = $150.

125000 points = $250.

250000 points = $500.

These vouchers provide just 0.2 cents per Hilton point. This is well below TPG's valuation of Hilton points (0.6 cents per point) and isn't a redemption we recommend.

How to redeem Hilton points for experiences

You can also redeem Hilton Honors points for travel experiences through Hilton Experiences.

Available experiences often include tickets to sporting events dinner at top restaurants concert tickets and more. Some of these can be purchased immediately with points while others require you to bid against other Hilton Honors members.

There are some pretty neat experiences available as of writing this piece including the ultimate Sunday brunch at Conrad Centennial Singapore and a Gintastic tasting with a Czech gin aficionado in Prague.

While you're generally best off redeeming hotel points for hotel stays snagging a unique experience using your points can make for a fantastic redemption. This is how TPG's Katie Genter recently enjoyed a 60-minute couples massage and a 4-course dinner for two with just 20000 Hilton Honors points.

Look through the Hilton Honors Experiences page to see if anything strikes your fancy.

How to transfer Hilton points to airlines

Hilton Honors has 27 loyalty partners to which you can transfer your Hilton Honors points.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

However note that Hilton Honors has less-than-ideal transfer ratios. For example you can exchange 10000 Hilton Honors points for a mere 1000 Delta SkyMiles. Transfer ratios vary from one airline to the next so check Hilton's transfer site for your airline of choice.

Redeem Hilton points on Lyft rides

Hilton has a partnership with Lyft which is a fantastic way to earn some extra Hilton points on your Lyft rides. On the redemption side however it's not so pretty.

(Screenshot from lyft-loyaltywallet.points.com)

You can convert your Hilton points to a Lyft credit ‚Äî similar to a gift card. Regardless of how much you convert to a Lyft credit you'll get a piddly 0.22 cents per dollar.

Redeem Hilton points for car rentals

Hilton has a partnership with National Alamo and Enterprise so you can redeem your points for a car rental. However this option doesn't provide a good return on your hard-earned points. In our tests using points for a rental car consistently provided 0.2 cents per point.

For example a four-day intermediate car rental with National at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) costs nearly 250000 points.

(Screenshot from hilton.loyaltytravelrewards.com)

You can reserve the same car for around $90 per day (and significantly less with a university code).

Redeem Hilton points for Amazon purchases

Finally you can redeem Hilton Honors points to cover Amazon purchases. Just link your Hilton Honors account to your Amazon account and select Hilton Honors points as your payment method at checkout. Amazon will tell you how many points it takes to cover your order and you can use your points to cover the entire order or just part of your purchase.

Should you use Hilton Honors points for Amazon purchases? Our research found that Hilton Honors points are worth 0.2 cents per point when redeemed toward Amazon purchases. This means you're effectively cutting the currency's valuation by two-thirds.

I'm all for having additional options for using your points and miles but in general you should never use Hilton points (nor any other currency) at Amazon.

How to earn Hilton points

Of course all of the above redemptions require you to have Hilton points in your account. Fortunately there are various ways to earn more Hilton Honors points. One of the quickest ways to do so is by adding a new Hilton Honors card to your wallet. Here are the currently available options and their welcome offers:

The information for the Hilton Aspire card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Bottom line

As you can see there are many interesting ways to redeem Hilton Honors points. However we recommend sticking with hotel stays ‚Äî this generally provides the most value getting you closer to (or even higher than) TPG's valuation of 0.6 cents per Hilton point.

The other option I'd recommend considering is Hilton Honors Experiences especially if you're looking for a unique event that may not be otherwise available to you.

(Holger M. Obenaus)

The Heritage Golf Group which owns and operates Hilton Head Island-based Oyster Reef Port Royal and Shipyard Golf Clubs recently acquired Palmetto Golf and Country Club expanding its island folio to 117 total holes of golf. Opened in the early 90s the 36-hole venue features layouts designed by Arthur Hills and Robert Cupp. The Arthur Hills Course was the first to welcome golfers in 1991 and was named one of Golf Digest‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest New Courses.‚Äù The Robert Cupp Course followed in 1993 with a slope rating of 152 ‚Äì the highest in the state at the time ‚Äì and a series of geometrically shaped bunkers Cupp designed via CAD (computer-aided design).

‚ÄúWith the resurgence in golf travel and the number of choices golfers have for golf getaways it‚Äôs crucial that we promote our region‚Äôs amazing golf lodging and culinary assets‚Äù says Mark Burnett President and CEO of Heritage Golf Group. ‚ÄúWe are thrilled with the recent addition of Palmetto Hall Golf and Country Club to our portfolio and excited for its inclusion in Hilton Head Golf Island alongside Oyster Reef Port Royal and Shipyard.‚Äù

As part of the acquisition Heritage Golf Group has committed to a multi-million-dollar golf course improvement project scheduled to begin in the coming weeks. The Arthur Hills and Robert Cupp courses were long considered among the Lowcountry‚Äôs best layouts and Heritage Golf Group‚Äôs clear-cut objective is to return them to their 90s glory. As a pairing the courses present a compelling contrast ‚Äì the traditional look and feel of the Arthur Hills Course juxtaposed against the ultra-modern shaping and geometric bunkers of the Robert Cupp Course. Both have been continually praised for their ingenuity shot values playability and conditioning.

(Holger M. Obenaus)

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an exciting day when we can welcome one of the area‚Äôs iconic golf brands back to Hilton Head Golf Island‚Äù says Lowcountry Golf Course Owner‚Äôs Association President Brad Mara. ‚ÄúThe addition of Palmetto Hall Golf and Country Club increases our marketing collective to 28 courses including world-renown properties such as The Sea Pines Resort and Palmetto Dunes Oceanfront Resort. With our wide-array of accommodation types and world-class restaurants there‚Äôs never been a better time to visit Golf Island.‚Äù

Getting to Golf Island has never been easier. Hilton Head Island Airport (HHH) on the island‚Äôs north end offers non-stop and one-stop service from multiple hub cities and connections via American Airlines Delta and United. American offers daily non-stop flights from Charlotte and seasonal service from Dallas / Ft. Worth Philadelphia and Washington National (DCA). Delta has daily flights to Atlanta and United provides daily non-stop service to Newark (EWR) and Washington Dulles (IAD).

Golfers can also utilize Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (SAV) with direct flights from numerous East Coast Midwest and Texas airports on several major and discount airlines. For golfers who prefer to hit the open road major metro areas in the Carolinas Georgia and north Florida are under a half-day‚Äôs drive while several Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern cities are seven to nine hours away.

We speak to readers and clients about San Diego hotels daily so know what they‚Äôre booking. This list is also based on their feedback and information from our contacts on each property and personal experience.

1. Park Hyatt Aviara Resort Golf Club and Spa

Location: Carlsbad

Hotel class: Luxury

You want:

to stay in one of our nicest resorts.

play golf at an acclaimed course.

recently-renovated rooms and suites.

daily onsite resort activities.

total rejuvenation during spa treatments.

stunning views of the foothills or lagoon.

Choose: Park Hyatt Aviara

This resort is among our most popular choices for families and is what I consider the top five luxury properties in all of San Diego. It‚Äôs one of our most requested and booked hotels.

The pool area is a big draw and the entire resort is newly renovated. The rooms are sizeable enough that the two bed rooms have two king-sized beds which parents particularly love. Single king rooms have sofa beds should you prefer a seating area by day.

The Arnold Palmer specialty suite has a putting green on its terrace. But even more popular with our clients is the Fireside Terrace Suite which has two patios with a fire pit on one of them.

You‚Äôll easily stay entertained onsite as this full-service resort boasts a variety of indulgent amenities along with daily planned activities. Tee off at the Arnold Palmer-designed golf course or relax in the over 15000-square-foot spa that includes a solarium lounge.

a quieter boutique hotel.

a fire pit room with a large wrap-around sofa.

It is not a sprawling Hyatt San Diego resort but rather an intimate boutique hotel with great service ‚Äî and that‚Äôs exactly what makes it stand out.

Sustainability is a priority here as you‚Äôll quickly notice when dining onsite. Locally-sourced ingredients make each meal wonderfully fresh while the international flavors at the esteemed restaurant Vaga (make reservations in advance because it‚Äôs popular with locals) are sure to please.

The beach below is on the quieter side also but Alila Marea Beach Resort will set up chairs and umbrellas for you. Note that the pool runs on the small side but that‚Äôs typical for our boutique hotels.

Your room or suite has a soothing design that pairs minimalism with natural elements. Many rooms provide gorgeous coastal views and the fire pit rooms are very popular.

As one of the more recent additions to San Diego‚Äôs Hyatt lineup The Seabird Resort brings the best of the coastal vacation experience to Oceanside in the north end of San Diego County.

The resort is conveniently situated not only near the beach but also right next to the Mission Pacific. As sister hotels these Oceanside gems provide full access to one another; if you stay at The Seabird you can take advantage of Mission Pacific‚Äôs amenities ‚Äî and vice versa.

Of course there‚Äôs plenty to keep you happy right at The Seabird Resort. The pool deck invites you to soak in the sun while the library provides a less expected ‚Äî but equally wonderful ‚Äî means of relaxing. Of the two The Seabird is significantly more family-friendly with activities and amenities for kids.

Both Mission Pacific and The Seabird are excellent choices when you want to stay near the beach. In fact the hotel‚Äôs staff can set up your beach chair and umbrella on your behalf so all you need to do is stroll to the beach at your leisure.

This Marina District gem is a favorite among business travelers although it provides plenty to keep vacationers happy.

Despite this hotel‚Äôs convenient location you may never feel the need to travel offsite for meals. Instead you can expect locally-sourced entrees served alongside exceptional California wine at multiple restaurants.

If nothing else you should check out the Top of the Hyatt lounge on the 40th floor where you‚Äôll be astounded by the city panoramas.

As you retreat to your room you‚Äôll observe a minimalist design prompted in part by the hotel‚Äôs effort to develop sustainable accommodations. Do yourself a favor and upgrade to a suite; they are surprisingly affordable at this location.

Which Hyatt Hotels in San Diego are Best for Families?

The best Hyatt hotels on this list that are best for families include:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvaG90ZWxzLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvcGhvZW5peC1ob3RlbHMtcm9vbXMtcHJpY2VzLXN1cGVyLWJvd2wtMjAyMy8xMDM1MTIzMzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Super Bowl 2023: Hotel rooms already running out in Phoenix,"Super Bowl LVII‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã overlaps with the Phoenix Open golf tournament.

Many hotels in metro Phoenix are already sold out for the weekend of Feb. 10-12.

Smaller chains and independent hotels also are displaying higher rates.

Super Bowl LVII won't be played for another six months.

But Phoenix-area hotels already have scarce availability for the big game set for Feb. 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale.

Many hotels in metro Phoenix including Hilton Marriott and IHG properties are sold out for the weekend of Feb. 10-12 plus the days after the game according to a check of hotel reservations websites.

Even hotels in outer areas like Buckeye Happy Valley and Queen Creek showed no availability during a check of the hotel chains' reservations websites in early August.

And the hotels with vacancies will cost you.

The Hilton Garden Inn Phoenix Midtown about 17 miles from State Farm Stadium showed a rate of $1114 per night for a Feb. 10-13 stay. MK Hotels Mesa about 33 miles from the stadium showed $452 per night for the same dates ‚Äì and that's on the lower end of prices we saw.

Smaller chains and independent hotels also are displaying higher rates. Sonder at McKinley about 17 miles from the stadium in downtown Phoenix has a studio apartment with a balcony available for $1367 per night on Super Bowl weekend; the same room is $182 per night Jan. 27-30 two weekends before the big game.

""One of our salespeople was trying to bring a small group for a meeting around Super Bowl time and the cheapest rate was around $1200 per night"" said Eric Kerr vice president of insights and development with Visit Phoenix which promotes tourism to the city. ""We know a lot of places have their sites filled up.""

Does the Super Bowl 2023 overlap with Phoenix Open golf tournament?

Enormous interest in travel to Phoenix in February is not only because of Super Bowl 57.

The WM Phoenix Open golf tournament is scheduled for Feb. 6-12 coinciding with Super Bowl festivities.

This double shot of major sporting events will pack the region's hotels especially the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess the host resort for the WM Phoenix Open.

""We are busy the entire week leading up to Super Bowl Sunday with golf tournament guests who have been staying with us each year for more than a decade"" said John Glynn spokesman for the Princess.

The hotel is sold out Feb. 7-15 and demand for stays around those dates is also high he said. A search of room rates showed that standard rates start at $699 per night for Feb. 1-6 stays and $799 for Feb. 16-18 stays.

Many February guests are showing interest in the resort's upcoming luxury ""hotel within a hotel"" the Privado Villas which has an anticipated fall 2022 debut.

How soon should I book hotel rooms for the Super Bowl LVII?

Interest in Super Bowl hotel bookings traditionally comes in three waves said Jesse Thompson area director of sales and marketing for Hotel Valley Ho in Scottsdale and Mountain Shadows Resort in Paradise Valley.

The first wave from travelers who book rooms in the days after the previous Super Bowl already passed. The second wave is from travelers who book when the NFL season begins he said.

Finally the third wave comes from travelers who book as the playoff season starts to pan out Thompson said. This includes people traveling from the home cities of the teams in the playoffs.

Glendale lists about 12 hotels in the Glendale Sports and Entertainment District that are the closest to State Farm Stadium.

All are sold out for Super Bowl weekend.

These hotels include the Renaissance Phoenix Glendale Hotel & Spa which saw ""very high"" demand and at higher room rates than prior Super Bowls.

Steve Eberhart general manager of the Renaissance Phoenix Glendale thinks the pent-up demand for travel since the pandemic has kept room occupancy and nightly rates high in recent months.

Can you still stay in Phoenix for the Super Bowl?

It's possible. Cancellations could occur in the months and weeks leading up to the game.

Some people who book early will cancel if their team doesn't make it in allowing fans whose teams are going to find a hotel said Eberhart.

""We hope to have some rooms available to be able to accommodate some of these fans as well"" he said.

If finding a hotel in metro Phoenix for Super Bowl 2023 is impossible or out of your price range another option is to stay outside the Phoenix area and drive in on game day.

Hotels are available for the weekend in Prescott about 100 miles from State Farm Stadium and Tucson about 129 miles. Most hotels in Prescott are less than $200 a night for the weekend while most room rates in Tucson fall in the $200s and $300s.

Past Super Bowls also packed Phoenix hotels

STR which tracks hotel data shared this information about how Arizona's three previous Super Bowls affected occupancy levels and average daily rates in the months they were held:

January 1996: 72.6% occupancy $114.46 average daily rate.

72.6% occupancy $114.46 average daily rate. February 2008: 78.3% occupancy $170.78 average daily rate.

78.3% occupancy $170.78 average daily rate. February 2015: 81.5% occupancy $151.54 average daily rate.

However Super Bowl months didn't always translate to peak tourism for the Phoenix area.

STR's data showed that occupancy peaked in March in all three of those years highlighting the metro area's importance as a destination for spring break/spring training tourism. February 2008 was the only Super Bowl month with average daily rates that were the highest of the year according to STR.

Glendale will look to its previous experience hosting the 2008 and 2015 Super Bowls at State Farm Stadium which opened in 2006. The 1996 Super Bowl was played at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe.

Here's How It Went,"We Tried The Cheapest Cordless Power Drill At Home Depot. Here's How It Went

Outside of buying say a 2x4 or a flat of pansies what could be a more prototypical Home Depot shopping experience than picking up a cordless drill? HomeFixated's Mark Lyman says a cordless drill is the handyman's most essential tool (via Art of Manliness). Lyman also says not to be a cheapskate when buying a drill but we aim to do just that.

Shopping for cordless tools at Home Depot can be a frustrating needlessly obscure process often involving locked cages smartphones ladders looks of apologetic puzzlement and much squirting at and re-checking of SKU numbers. Since the locked cages didn't prevent the staff from losing all six of the underpowered Ryobi PDD209s they were supposed to have in stock the Ryobi PCL206 was the cheapest cordless power drill at Home Depot at the same $59.97 price including two 1.5 Ah batteries and a charger. This took our little enterprise from the realm of certain failure to the realm of potential.

Since this is a drill review and not a battery platform review let's deal with the battery thing up front. The Ryobi 18V One+ system seems to be powered by quality lithium batteries. Its chargers are fast enough ... certainly fast enough to charge before you can drain a second battery in most cases. And the One+ power tools are good enough that unless you're religiously opposed to mixing battery platforms there's no reason to discount the Ryobi system even if you've already committed to another.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbGVkb2JsYWRlLmNvbS9sb2NhbC9jb21tdW5pdHktZXZlbnRzLzIwMjIvMDgvMTgvY291cmFnZW91cy1hY3Jlcy1jYW1wLW9hay1vcGVuaW5ncy1tZXRyb3Bhcmsvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyMDgxODE1MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Volunteers bolster renovation project at special camp,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGFtZGFuemlnZXIvMjAyMi8wOC8yMS90cmFlZ2VyLWlzLXRoZS1hcHBsZS1icmFuZC1pbi10aGUtYmF0dGxlLWZvci10aGUtYmFyYmVjdWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In The Barbecue Battle Traeger Is The 'Apple' Brand In Outdoor Cooking,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2022/08/21/traeger-is-the-apple-brand-in-the-battle-for-the-barbecue/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGFtZGFuemlnZXIvMjAyMi8wOC8yMS90cmFlZ2VyLWlzLXRoZS1hcHBsZS1icmFuZC1pbi10aGUtYmF0dGxlLWZvci10aGUtYmFyYmVjdWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYWQtY2l0eS1iZWF0LmNvbS9pY3ltaS0xMC1uZXctdHJpYWQtcmVzdGF1cmFudHMtdGhhdC1vcGVuZWQtcmVjZW50bHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ICYMI: 10+ new Triad restaurants that opened recently,"In the midst/aftermath of the pandemic it can be hard to keep track of what‚Äôs open what‚Äôs new and what‚Äôs gone especially in the food industry where turnover is quick and often quiet.

The applicant sought a change of zoning on the property at 180 Middle Country Road from J Business 4 to J Business 6 with special permits for a major restaurant with accessory drive-thru. That application was granted at the Brookhaven Town Board meeting on Aug. 11 after a public hearing.

A long time coming the project had support from the Coram Civic Association and local officials as the developers worked with the corporation to make changes to the design of the building that were in line with the historical Davis House across the street.

According to the Davis Town Meeting House Society website the home is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is a designated Brookhaven Town Landmark.

Keith Archer Harris Bloom and Archer who represented the applicant at the board meeting said that much consideration was put into the redevelopment of the site first of which was whether the bank building could be adapted for a new use.

‚ÄúA lot of time was spent in determining the appropriate use and if the existing building could be reused‚Äù he said.

Ultimately it was decided that the building would need to be razed and rebuilt but Archer said that input from the community and town officials contributed to a new look and feel for the Popeye‚Äôs restaurant.

‚ÄúThis is not the conventional Popeye‚Äôs restaurant‚Äù he said.

There are architectural changes and the typical corporate colors have been muted. Bonner said that officials wanted to make sure the design and colors paid respect to the historical Davis House on the opposite side of the street.

The 1.36-acre property is next to the Burger King on Middle Country Road to the west and north of the Stop & Shop/Home Depot shopping center. Plans call for 26 parking spots to be provided which includes two handicap spaces. It also shows space for seven cars to queue up in the drive-thru area measuring 9-feet wide by 22-feet long.

Construction is estimated to take four months in total and cost around $1.6 million. A land use intensification mitigation fee of $30960 will be paid by the applicant to the Joseph Macchia Environmental Preservation Fund. Money in the fund is used for land preservation by Brookhaven Town.

Also revealed by Councilwoman Bonner was that the New York State DOT is proposing improvements to the intersection to increase capacity of the road and efficiency of vehicle movements. No specific details on the project are available yet.

Archer said that the Popeye‚Äôs restaurant will be consistent with development in the area but more importantly it is a ‚Äúvery different type of store.‚Äù

Bonner agreed and said that the project will bring jobs to the area while making use of the vacant bank property.

‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs a win for the community‚Äù she said.

""She has seen a lot of stuff"" said son Duane Reed whose mother died Aug. 8 after a monthslong illness.

As a child in Shuqualak Miss. she endured segregation and the Great Depression. She was allowed to attend school just three months a year.

Her mother died when she was 5 and she and six siblings scattered to relatives until the Great Migration and President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal carried her coal-miner father north to a steady job in Chicago. Reed who'd been whisked away to care for her sister's kids in Tennessee was about 12 when the family reunited.

Uneasy at her fast-paced integrated Chicago city school Reed quit after the ninth grade. She worked at Canfield Beverages and later at a plant making ammunition for soldiers during World War II.

Being a ""Rosie the Riveter"" proved hard but Reed liked working and abided the Depression era tenets of her family: Work. Waste not. And ""pool your resources!""

She met Walter Reed at a church social. They married in 1945 and moved to St. Paul which remained her adopted home until she died.

""Everybody loved her. She talked to anybody and everybody and treated everybody the same no matter what you looked like or who you were"" said eldest granddaughter Lisa Reaves.

Lillian and Walter moved in with his brother on Iglehart Avenue when they were new to St. Paul. She found assembly line work at the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant in New Brighton and later at Honeywell while Walter worked as an orderly at the veterans hospital.

They had three sons before buying a home in 1950 on Carroll Avenue in the historically Black Rondo neighborhood. They lived two blocks from Pilgrim Baptist Church where she brought the boys every Sunday and attended herself for 75 years

On Carroll Avenue Reed taught her small sons the tricks of joyful frugality. Walter Michael Duane and Ronald remember with a chuckle that she'd buy them a single ice cream cone and have them take turns licking.

But like ice cream the treats on Carroll Avenue wouldn't last. The city took the Reed house along with 700 other Rondo houses under eminent domain in 1956 to make way for Interstate 94. The Reeds then built a house on Fuller Avenue for $15000. To pay for it she assembled Honeywell thermostats by day and waitressed nights at Road Buddy's Bar-B-Que.

Reed always said she was comfortable not being rich. She religiously balanced the family checkbook to the penny grew and canned all her vegetables and pooled resources to stave off ""Old Man Poverty"" and survive. Beyond that what mattered most she often said was: ""When you treat people right you can sleep at night"" Duane recalled. ""That's what she really believed contributed to her longevity.""

Reed retired from Honeywell in 1974 after 25 years but didn't rest. She adopted her disabled infant grandson Kevin and went back to school to learn ""the new math"" so she could tutor him and be his advocate at school.

Reed instilled in Kevin and the rest of the family a love for the education she never received.

If given the opportunity she would have been a teacher said Reaves who teaches English in the state of Virginia. ""She loved teaching and history and that combination made her love everything about my profession.""

At 85 Reed flew to Virginia to talk to Reaves' seventh-graders about the influences the Depression segregation the Great Migration and Roosevelt's New Deal had on her life.

Reed's talk became an annual history lesson for Reaves' classes for 15 years. ""These 12- and 13-year-old students loved her stories and her struggle. They write her letters that are so heartfelt"" Reaves said. ""Now I don't have that lesson anymore. But I will try and honor her in another way.""

Funeral services have been held. Reed is survived by sons Walter Michael Duane and Ronald six grandchildren eight great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nL2RlbnNvLWNyZWF0ZXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtbW90b3ItbGlsaXVtLWpldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Denso creates electric motor for Lilium Jet,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/denso-creates-electric-motor-lilium-jet on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nL2RlbnNvLWNyZWF0ZXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtbW90b3ItbGlsaXVtLWpldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwNDM0MDkzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Kristy Gayle (Williamson) Kirch,"Kristy Gayle (Williamson) Kirch

State regulators ordered a northeast Iowa grain dealer to stop buying large amounts of grain after it failed to pay for an unspecified amount of grain among other violations of its licenses.

The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced Friday it suspended the grain dealer and warehouse licenses of B&B Farm Store in Jesup just east of Waterloo.

""The suspension is based upon the company's failure to pay for priced grain grain shortage and record keeping violations"" IDALS said.

Don McDowell a spokesman for the department declined to elaborate on those allegations because IDALS has requested an administrative law hearing about the matter. Such hearings can result in financial penalties for grain dealers.

Generally dealers that buy at least 1000 bushels of grain per month are licensed and regulated by the state to help protect grain producers from losses. Dealers are required to have sufficient assets to cover their debts for grain purchases and those that don't can have their licenses suspended.

District court records show that Farmers State Bank filed last week for foreclosure against B&B and an associated company J&D Investors seeking more than $4.6 million in unpaid debts. The businesses avoided foreclosure early this year through mediation but have since failed to make payments that were stipulated by that mediated agreement according to the bank's recent foreclosure petition. Court records did not indicate any other pending litigation against B&B.

The state maintains an indemnity fund that covers up to $300000 worth of losses incurred by individual producers who sell grain to state-licensed dealers but aren't paid.

B&B Farm Store declined to comment for this article. It's unclear when the administrative law hearing will be held.

The business sells outdoor equipment and supplies and it also operates a feed mill according to air quality permit data of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The company's website says it sells feed for cattle dogs goats horses pigs and poultry. Satellite images of the site depict several large grain bins.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui ‚Äî the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani ‚Äî continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

That‚Äôs clear today as they‚Äôve unveiled the most powerful car in their history.



Known as the Bentley Mulliner Batur the model is a luxurious grand touring coupe that features an upgraded version of the company‚Äôs familiar twin-turbo 6.0-liter W12. While the engine is ‚Äúentering its twilight years‚Äù it‚Äôs not dead yet and engineers equipped it with a new intake upgraded turbochargers beefy intercoolers and numerous recalibrations. They didn‚Äôt stop there as the engine was also outfitted with a titanium exhaust which comes complete with 3D-printed titanium finishers.

Thanks to all these changes the engine produces more than 730 hp (544 kW / 740 PS) and 737 lb-ft (1000 Nm) of torque. That‚Äôs at least 80 hp (60 kW / 81 PS) and 74 lb-ft (100 Nm) more than the Continental GT Speed which can rocket from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in 3.5 seconds before hitting a top speed of 208 mph (335 km/h).

While Bentley declined to release detailed performance specifications for the Batur the engine is connected to an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. The model also comes equipped with four-wheel steering torque vectoring and an electronic limited slip differential.

Other performance features include an adaptive air suspension and an electric active anti-roll control system which can provide up to 959 lb-ft (1300 Nm) of anti-roll torque in a mere 0.3 seconds. The model also sports a Carbon-Silicon-Carbide (CSiC) braking system that features ten-piston calipers and 17.3 inch (440 mm) discs up front as well as four-piston calipers and 16.1 inch (410 mm) discs out back.

The Future Of Bentley Design

Besides being the most powerful Bentley in history the Batur is notable for featuring a modernized design that will ‚Äúultimately guide‚Äù the styling direction of the company‚Äôs upcoming EVs.

The automaker didn‚Äôt go into many specifics but noted the car has been equipped with an updated grille that is lower and more upright for a strong and confident appearance. The model also has an ‚Äúendless bonnet‚Äù as well as minimalist headlights that are described as an evolution of those used on the Bacalar.

Moving further back we can see edgy bodywork and a pronounced shoulder line. Designers also moved the car‚Äôs visual mass rearward for a sportier and more muscular aesthetic.

Other notable highlights include a power deployable spoiler and 22-inch wheels that are unique to the model. Buyers will also find a front splitter aerodynamic side skirts and a rear diffuser that can be crafted in either carbon or natural fiber composite.

Production will be limited to 18 units and all of them have already been spoken for despite a base price of ¬£1.65 ($1.95 / ‚Ç¨1.94) million. Each will be ‚Äúdesigned collaboratively‚Äù with its owner and they‚Äôll be able to specify the color and finish of virtually every surface of the Batur. For the exterior alone there‚Äôs the traditional Mulliner color palette as well as fully bespoke options and even hand-painted graphics. Buyers can also choose between light dark satin gloss or titanium exterior brightwork. Another option is a graduated contrast color grille for a ‚Äúvibrant ombre effect.‚Äù

The interior is extensively customizable as well as clients can order everything from natural fiber composite veneers to more traditional wood trim. If that isn‚Äôt special enough certain controls are available in 3D-printed 18K gold.

Once customers create their ideal vehicle it will be handcrafted over the course of several months by Mulliner. If everything goes according to plan the first deliveries should occur in mid-2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG93ZWVrLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Z1dHVyZS1jYXJzL2E0MDk0Njk1OS9jemluZ2Vycy1mb3VyLXNlYXQtaHlwZXItZ3QtY291bGQtYmUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWNvdXBlLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Czinger's Four-Seat Hyper GT Signals the Future,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.autoweek.com/news/future-cars/a40946959/czingers-four-seat-hyper-gt-could-be-future-of-coupe-production/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG93ZWVrLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Z1dHVyZS1jYXJzL2E0MDk0Njk1OS9jemluZ2Vycy1mb3VyLXNlYXQtaHlwZXItZ3QtY291bGQtYmUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWNvdXBlLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2FmZm9yZGFibGUtY2Fycy1wcm9kdWNlLXdheS1tb3JlLXBvd2VyLXRoYW4tdGhlLXByaWNlcy1zdWdnZXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 10 Affordable Cars Produce Way More Power Than The Prices Suggest,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2FmZm9yZGFibGUtY2Fycy1wcm9kdWNlLXdheS1tb3JlLXBvd2VyLXRoYW4tdGhlLXByaWNlcy1zdWdnZXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHMuY29tL25ld3Mvd2Vlay1haGVhZC1jb3VudHJpZXMtdG8tcmVsZWFzZS1mbGFzaC1wbWktZGF0YS11cy1wcmVsaW1pbmFyeS1nZHAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Week ahead: Countries to release flash PMI data US preliminary GDP | markets.com,"It is a week filled with releases of flash Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index (PMI) data as Germany and the United Kingdom will report theirs on Monday and the United States will follow on Tuesday.

German UK & US flash PMI

The German manufacturing and services sector shrunk in July as companies continued to be affected by inflation Germany‚Äôs PMI data for services fell to 49.2 in July from 52.4 one month prior. Data for the countries manufacturing index fell to 49.2 from 52.0. Analysts are forecasting flash services PMI to be at 51.2 and manufacturing PMI at 50.6.

In the UK business activity in July posted its weakest rise in 17 months as the country‚Äôs manufacturing PMI fell to 52.8 from the previous month‚Äôs 53.7 high. This was the lowest reading since February 2021. The services PMI dropped to 53.3 in July from 54.3 in June.

US flash PMI data will be released on Tuesday. The country‚Äôs services PMI data fell to 47.3 in July from 52.7 in June ‚Äì the sharpest fall in output since May 2020. US manufacturing PMI data fell for the first time since June 2020 in July 2022. Manufacturing PMI data fell to 52.2 in July from 53.0 in June.

The finale of earnings season

This is the finale of this quarter‚Äôs earnings season with some of the most prominent companies to report their earnings on Wednesday being NVIDIA (NVDA) Salesforce (CRM) and Snowflake (SNOW). On Thursday HP Inc. (HPQ) and Peloton (PTON) are due to report their earnings and don‚Äôt forget to look out for Intuit (INTU) on Tuesday and JD.com (JD) on Monday.

Preliminary US GDP

The US economy fell for the second straight quarter from April to June. US GDP fell 0.9% at an annualised rate for the period this follows a 1.6% decline in the first quarter and worse than the analyst estimates for a gain of 0.3%.

A second straight negative GDP reading meets a long-held basic view of recession analysts are pointing out but officially the National Bureau of Economic Research declares recessions and expansions and is likely not to judge the period in question.

Preliminary data will be released on Thursday and will help analysts figure out where the economy is headed.

Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports

It appears the Minnesota Golden Gophers are having trouble selling tickets to their first two home games of the season so they‚Äôre turning to a rather embarrassing promotion in order to fill the stands.

The Gophers open the 2022 college football season with two home games against the New Mexico State Lobos and the Western Illinois Leathernecks. Tickets to those games aren‚Äôt very expensive even if bought at face value ‚Äì a fan can get into either game for $30 or less ‚Äì but a new promotion is basically giving the tickets away.

Minnesota is partnering with Red Barron Pizza for an extremely generous promotion. If a fan buys three Red Barron pizzas they can receive two Minnesota football tickets to either the New Mexico State game or the Western Illinois game.

To take advantage of the promotion all fans have to do is purchase any three Red Baron Pizza products at participating stores from Aug. 7 to Aug. 28 then email their receipt to contests@gophersportsproperties.com with a message including your name email address and phone number.

Minnesota‚Äôs Huntington Bank Stadium has a listed capacity of 50805. So it looks like Red Barron will have to sell quite a few pizzas if they‚Äôre going to fill every seat for their first two home games.

Instead of parroting the rest of the observability industry talking about metrics traces and logs we focused on the value the IBM Instana‚Ñ¢ platform brings to users when they use that data.

We never talked about how the IBM Instana platform has metrics traces and logs because that‚Äôs kind of a given. Some took‚Äîor mistook‚Äîthat approach to mean that the IBM Instana solution didn‚Äôt actually provide any log data one of the three legs of the observability stool. In reality The IBM Instana platform has always captured stored and analyzed application log data. Naturally it‚Äôs done within the context of the monitored service the underlying infrastructure all service dependencies overall performance individual traces and the architecture and performance of the application itself.

To actually see that data yourself all you have to do is pop in a trace‚Äîand there it is right on the screen‚Äîlogs. We had our reasons for putting it here mostly because the primary use case of examining log data for our users is troubleshooting which is usually done from within either a trace or from our Unbounded analytics advanced analytics engine.

The value of enterprise observability

Enterprise observability means moving beyond code; ingesting monitoring metrics open-source data (if available) traces log data and even profiles with an understanding of how all these things work together to make better decisions about operating production applications:

Full automation in the monitoring lifecycle

Comprehensive context applied to the entire data set

Intelligent actions taken by both our solution and its users

While traditional application performance monitoring (APM) solutions create visibility where there‚Äôs none within the application code itself enterprise observability creates visibility throughout distributed application services whether or not they contain custom code‚Äîthen correlating metrics logs traces and profiles with an eye on dependencies to get the context of performance in relation to other components. This process helps both the platform and its users take more intelligent action to act proactively and solve problems before they occur.

Where does log data come into enterprise observability?

The IBM Instana platform has been collecting logging data since its early releases. A quick look through our documentation webinar schedule or partner site and you see a set of analysis partners including Humio LogDNA and Coralogix. Most recently IBM exposed logs as a part of the Unbounded analytics section of the IBM Instana to give users data where they need it along with the context to correlate logs to metrics and traces together to make actionable insights faster and more efficiently.

As a bit of background a log is a programmatically produced file that contains a record of events that happen within a system. The point of a log file is to allow a user to keep track of what an application or service is doing inside the computer. Because logs might contain deep data they can be used to debug an application or service when something goes awry. In the most simplistic form log messages are recorded into a single log file though they can also be recorded into any number of files.

In previous releases of the IBM Instana platform contextual log data was available in the context of a trace inside Unbounded analytics which enabled users to quickly and efficiently debug and perform root cause analysis without getting lost in endless screens of log data. Part of the promise of enterprise observability is context and the ability to connect data with other data. While interesting one could argue that data without context is almost irrelevant. To that end and to bring better context to our users we decided to expose the same logging data we already collected on a completely separate and more easily accessible section of Unbounded analytics to make log information easier to absorb and correlate with the other data the IBM Instana platform collects.

Making application logs a first-class citizen of IBM Instana Unbounded analytics

Today marks the availability of logging data through a completely separate section of Unbounded analytics in the IBM Instana platform. It marks the first time IBM Instana users will be able to analyze error and warning logs outside of a trace. Another benefit of being inside Unbounded analytics is the analysis of the log data through our structured query mechanism. By utilizing a structured query mechanism that lets developers and users analyze error and warning logs the IBM Instana solution makes user experience easier by enabling faster and more precise troubleshooting. It will also bring a new perspective to troubleshooting helping identify solve and remove problems.

With this goal in mind IBM still teams with popular log aggregation tools to both integrate with a user‚Äôs existing IT operations ecosystem and provide a more traditional system information and event management experience if a user is looking for even more information. We believe that exposing logging data in the Unbounded analytics section of the platform continues our theme of context and intelligent action keeping our users from getting drowned in a sea of logging data and continuing our promise of delivering a fully automated enterprise observability solution.

That growth is coming from companies looking to automate customer interactions sure but also increasingly in areas like advanced search and document insights so that a user could say ‚Äúpull up last year‚Äôs August sales‚Äù and an assistant could surface the relevant document.

In the long run we believe that all enterprises across industries are poised to benefit from conversational AI solutions. This will only continue to grow as advancements in AI enable these systems to understand the unique language of their industry and business automate tasks and extract even more precise insights from complex documents and data ‚Äì without requiring sophisticated data science skills on the part of users. Additionally advancements that enable companies to build deeper integrations and to break down internal data silos will result in better more personalized experiences.

When it comes to customer care the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated adoption of conversational AI solutions across industries with many early adopters in retail healthcare and financial services. For example to help their customers navigate the Covid-19 vaccine rollout process CVS Health engaged IBM Consulting and began using IBM Watson Assistant to respond a deluge of common customer questions about eligibility side effects needed documentation and more. This freed up their human agents to handle more complicated issues. This is an extreme example but as we shift back to a new ‚Äúnormal‚Äù we see conversational AI playing a massive role in ensuring information direction and overall engagement is streamlined between the brand and the consumer.

Another area that we think is particularly ripe for disruption with conversational AI is in employee experience and productivity. Many organizations today are facing skills and labor shortages and they are looking for ways to free up their employees to focus on higher value tasks. Conversational AI can play a key role in this space. Many employees in fields like HR sales and marketing are constantly bogged down with repetitive tasks like scheduling meetings updating calendars requesting agendas sending reminders etc. With an intelligent automation solution that can be controlled using natural language employees can automate these repetitive tasks and reclaim their time to focus on what matters most.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2F1dG9tYXRpb24vdGhlLWVtZXJnZW5jZS1vZi10aGUtY2hpZWYtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1vZmZpY2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The emergence of the chief automation officer,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/automation/the-emergence-of-the-chief-automation-officer/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2F1dG9tYXRpb24vdGhlLWVtZXJnZW5jZS1vZi10aGUtY2hpZWYtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1vZmZpY2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdydW5nZS5jb20vOTczMDA1L3RoZS13b3JsZHMtc21hbGxlc3QtY29tcHV0ZXItaXMtc21hbGxlci10aGFuLXlvdS10aGluay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The World's Smallest Computer Is Smaller Than You Think,"The World's Smallest Computer Is Smaller Than You Think

IBM and the University of Michigan have had an ongoing competition for who can create the world's smallest computer. As of June 2018 Michigan is winning. That month the university unveiled a new micro-computer 10 times smaller than IBM's. It's about .3 mm in length per side far smaller than a grain of rice (via The University of Michigan).

Despite its tiny size the computer has random-access memory a processor and wireless transmitters and receivers. They receive and transmit data using visible light rather than radio antennae as is conventionally used because they're too small for the antennae to fit (via The University of Michigan). According to Digital Trends the computer also has a base station that along with an LED transmission light gives the computer power. The light is converted to electricity via a process called photovoltaics.

According to the university to achieve this Michigan engineers had to create a new type of circuit that's low-power but can tolerate light. The light from the base station and LED light create the circuit's currents. They also had to make sure the computer's readings were highly accurate despite the low power. Three Michigan professors of electrical and computer engineering worked on developing the computer: David Blaauw Dennis Sylvester and Jamie Phillips."

One way to get QAT is built-into chips. Examples include Rangeley Denverton and Ice Lake-D which all have built-in QAT. Another way has historically been to have an Intel PCH capable of QAT acceleration. For many systems the key has been utilizing effectively PCH‚Äôs on PCIe cards as standalone PCIe accelerators. Finding information on those PCIe QAT adapters seems harder to find than it should. As a result we are creating a little guide to help people understand the generations of QAT technology.

Intel QuickAssist Gen 0

The Gen 0 QAT was announced in 2007 by now CEO Pat Gelsinger in his ‚ÄúTolapai‚Äù product. We have not been able to find any PCIe cards that are based on this technology generation (the Intel EP80579.) Then again it was a very new concept for Intel at the time and was a first-generation technology.

The observation at the time was that encryption and other workloads would be more efficient on accelerators than on general-purpose cores. At the time HTTPS was not even a ubiquitous web technology.

Reader note: There was an older Intel IXP2xxx generation such as the Intel IXP2350 that we can find snippets of information on but this was the first attempt (pre-Tolapai) that was perhaps the ancestor of what has now become QuickAssist. Thank you for the tip!

Intel QuickAssist Gen 1

The codenames for this generation of cards were Granite Hill (8920) and Walnut Hill (8950.) Walnut Hill seems to be the one that there is the most information on and that part integrates a Coleto Creek chip onto a PCIe card.

Intel 8920 IQA89201G2P5 (up to 20Gbps)

Intel 8950 IQA89501G1P5 (up to 50Gbps)

Silicom P22ISCO2

Netgate CPIC 8955

The Intel 8920 utilized the Intel Communications Chipset 8920 while the Intel 8950 utilized the Intel Communications Chipset 8955.

One would find this generation in the Rangeley (Atom C2000) Cave Creek and Coleto Creek platforms. We think of this as more of the Xeon E5 generation technology although Broadwell-DE (Xeon D-1500) was a Gen2 part.

There also a number of third-party cards.

Intel QuickAssist Gen 2

Lewisburg PCH on a PCIe card. This series was focused on enabling the 10GbE/ 40GbE generations of servers storage and networking boxes initially then increased to the 100GbE generation as time moved on. The adapters we found that are part of the Lewis Hill QAT lines are:

Intel 8960 IQA89601G1P5 IQA89601G2P5 IQA89601G3P5 (up to 50Gbps)

Intel 8970 IQA89701G1P5 IQA89701G2P5 IQA89701G3P5 (up to 100Gbps)

Silicom M20E3ISLB is Intel QuickAssist PCH for a 2.5in U.2 Drive Tray

Silicom PE3ISLBTL

Cisco UCSC-P-IQAT8970

One can commonly find these in Broadwell-DE (Xeon D-1500 series) Hewitt Lake (Xeon D-1600 series) Skylake-D (Xeon D-2100 series) and Denverton (Atom C3000 series) parts.

Intel QuickAssist Gen 3

This is the current generation that focused on 25GbE 50GbE and 100GbE acceleration.

QAT Gen3 is found in Ice Lake-D/ Snow Ridge/ Parker Ridge chips. We are looking for others.

Intel QuickAssist Gen 4+

We know that current generation QAT solutions are not fast enough for next-generation Xeons nor adapters like the Google-Intel Mt. Evans IPU DPU. Intel has said Mt. Evans has QAT-based crypto and compression capabilities but it has not said that it is a QAT accelerator. Still Intel must have something coming for the 200Gbps and 400Gbps generations as we know it will continue yet those products have not been formally announced.

We will update this as it becomes available.

Intel QuickAssist Engine / QAT Engine

We are going to make a special note here. Sometimes when Intel discusses QuickAssist it actually is talking about the ‚ÄúQuickAssist Engine.‚Äù Intel has software that can utilize either the extensions built into 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable (Ice Lake) CPUs or QAT hardware acceleration. There is actually a large benefit from using the software QAT Engine with Ice Lake generation processors even without the hardware accelerators.

Final Words

If you find new adapters feel free to list the model number and generation in the forums. We can add them to this list. We are just creating this as a reference piece so that folks have some way to evaluate which card belongs to a given generation. Each generation brings new features like new ciphers that are accelerated. As a result you generally want the newest generation. Still it can be confusing to navigate so we are at least starting this guide.

We will also have a few QAT pieces to help show why and how this is being used in the industry. Stay tuned for those.

In the meantime if you see other cards or parts feel free to drop them in the comments or in the forums in this thread.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaW50ZWwtY29yZS12cy1pbnRlbC1jb3JlLXgtd2hhdHMtdGhlLWRpZmZlcmVuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core vs. Intel Core X: What's the Difference?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vaW50ZWwtY29yZS12cy1pbnRlbC1jb3JlLXgtd2hhdHMtdGhlLWRpZmZlcmVuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9pbnRlbC1tZXRlb3ItbGFrZS1jcHVzLXdpdGgtdGdwdS1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LWZlYXR1cmVzLXJheS10cmFjaW5nLXN1cHBvcnQtc3BvcnRzLWZwNjQtY29tcHV0ZS1idXQtbGFja3MteG14LXVuaXRzL9IBigFodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9pbnRlbC1tZXRlb3ItbGFrZS1jcHVzLXdpdGgtdGdwdS1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LWZlYXR1cmVzLXJheS10cmFjaW5nLXN1cHBvcnQtc3BvcnRzLWZwNjQtY29tcHV0ZS1idXQtbGFja3MteG14LXVuaXRzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Meteor Lake CPUs With TGPU Reportedly Features Ray Tracing Support Sports FP64 Compute But Lacks XMX Units,"In a new commit published on GitHub Intel might have confirmed ray tracing support for their Meteor Lake CPUs with Xe-HPG TGPU. The Intel 14th Gen Meteor Lake CPUs are scheduled for release in 2023 and will come with a range of new features including brand new hybrid cores integrated graphics using tiled- designs and a VPU accelerator which we talked about in our last coverage.

Intel Meteor Lake CPUs With TGPU Design Reportedly Comes With Ray Tracing & FP64 Support But Lacks XMX Units

According to a detailed report published by Coelacanth-Dream it looks like the GPU featured on the Intel Meteor Lake CPUs is detected as a Xe-HPG product within IGC (Intel Graphics Compiler). Considering that we can assume that it will be using the same architecture as the existing DG2 or Alchemist GPUs but that's not entirely the case.

The Meteor Lake GPU which is also known as tGPU (Tiled-GPU) does not support DPAS (Dot Product Accumulate Systolic) instructions executed through the XMX units because it reportedly is not equipped with those. In a previous report we covered how Intel's Meteor Lake CPU's graphics unit would lack XMX resulting in lower feature-level support for technologies such as XeSS but it will instead feature partial FP64 support something that's been missing in Intel iGPUs for the past few generations.

The more interesting detail is that the TGPU (Xe-MTL) on the Intel Meteor Lake CPUs is reportedly going to come with hardware-level raytracing support. The TGPU is said to offer the same level of ray-tracing support as Alchemist and Ponte Vecchio GPUs since there's no change in the design at least as far as ray tracing is concerned.

Regarding support for HW ray tracing on Meteor Lake GPUs IGC/AdaptorCommon/RayTracing/PrologueShaders.cpp  it IGFX_METEORLAKE is believed that they support it because of the addition of . Other than that in the code part that determines his HW ray tracing support it seems that Meteor Lake GPU supports it as well as Alchemist / DG2 and Ponte Vechhio because there is no change. via Coelacanth-Dream

Intel's Meteor Lake CPU tiled-GPU won't be the first integrated graphics chip to offer support for ray-tracing. AMD has been offering it for almost a year now with their Ryzen 6000 ""Rembrandt"" APUs that feature RDNA 2 iGPUs. This will be Intel's first ray-tracing-enabled integrated graphics but we hope that some partial XeSS or AI-level upsampling support is added. As we have seen with AMD's APUs technologies such as FSR 2.0 can really help deliver playable FPS in gaming titles and that would be really awesome for mobile gamers.

From sightings of new code patches for the Intel Graphics Compiler (IGC) the fishy tech poster has revealed that Meteor Lake iGPUs could have ray tracing support in hardware. Unfortunately a potential negative is that the iGPU may lack Intel XMX (Xe Matrix eXtension) units.

Intel‚Äôs 13th Gen Core processors codenamed Raptor Lake (RPL) are next up - and due quite imminently. However in 2023 we think Intel‚Äôs 14th Gen Core processors dubbed Meteor Lake (MTL) will cause quite a stir with several bold advanced steps taken. Regular readers will know that the transition from 13th to 14th Gen Core processors will move from Intel 7 to Intel 4. That isn‚Äôt all though as we will see Intel‚Äôs first disaggregated design with a TSMC N3 tile under the heat spreader. It will be the GPU portion of the chip and thanks to detective work from people like Coelacanth‚Äôs Dream we have an ever-growing clearer picture of this iGPU.

In July this year Coelacanth‚Äôs Dream discovered some Intel Linux patches which suggested MTL‚Äôs graphics tile would feature the Xe-HPG/Xe-LPG architecture and up to 128 EUs produced by TSMC using its N3 fabrication process. Now we have sight of the new code patches for the Intel Graphics Compiler (IGC) some more deductions can be made regarding the GPU tile.

Probably most interesting is the patch indicator that suggests Meteor Lake‚Äôs iGPU will have ray tracing hardware. Intel LGA1700 CPUs like Alder Lake and Raptor Lake come with up to 96 Xe-LP EUs. However Meteor Lake will have a Xe-HPG architecture GPU with more in common with the Alchemist / DG2 discrete graphics cards and might feature up to 128 or even 192 of these EUs. The ray tracing support feature was picked up in IGC where it sets ray tracing support to enabled if iGFX_meteorlake is detected. Moreover Meteor Lake also seems to support hardware ray tracing in any app that helps the feature in Alchemist / DG2 or Ponte Vecchio.

Adding ray tracing support to its iGPUs is a welcome move from Intel but it will only play catch-up with AMD which has had its Ryzen 6000 (Rembrandt) processors with RDNA2 iGPUs on sale throughout most of 2022.

Moving along to the issue of Meteor Lake‚Äôs iGPU architecture missing XMX units. It is observed through the IGC patches that MTL doesn‚Äôt support DPAS (Dot Product Accumulate Systolic) instructions that rely on XMX units. It hints that the iGPU doesn‚Äôt have XMX units which could negatively impact the acceleration of Intel XeSS for example. On the desktop a Xe-core features 16 XMX units which can do 128 FP16/BF16 256 INT8 or 512 INT4/INT2 operations per clock. They also accelerate XeSS but this scaling tech has a fallback to DP4a instructions mode.

Lastly it is worth remembering that Meteor Lake CPUs are quite a significant change for Intel and may face some teething trouble. About a fortnight ago we reported that Meteor Lake‚Äôs 3nm GPU Tile production at TSMC might have been postponed. It could be that Intel has decided to switch to the newer N3E process but it is hard to say from the sources whether this is indeed the case or some trouble is brewing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9pbnRlbHMtc3BlY2lhbC1zYW1wbGUtb2YtMTBubS1jYW5ub24tbGFrZS15LWNwdS13aXRoLTMtZGllLW1jbS1wYWNrYWdlLWhhcy1iZWVuLXNwb3R0ZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Intel's ""Special Sample"" of 10nm Cannon Lake-Y CPU with 3-die MCM package has been spotted","Intel 10nm Cannon Lake spotted on a smaller package

A ‚ÄúSpecial Sample‚Äù of unreleased Cannon Lake CPU has been pictured by YuuKi-AnS.

The hardware collector and reviewer obtained photos of the Cannon Lake-Y a smaller CPU compared to the Core i3-8121U the only processor released from the Cannon Lake series. The series launched in 2018 and discontinued less than two years later. This was in fact the shortest lived Intel architecture in the company‚Äôs history.

The CPU has unusual three die config which is different from 2-die version official released under 8th Gen Core U-series. According to some leaked datasheets for Cannon Lake-Y series the third die is McIVR and it measures 13.72 mm¬≤.

It is not apparent what does ‚ÄúSpecial Samples‚Äù engraved on the CPU really means but it is clear that the CPU had thermocouples attached for power and heat testing.

The Cannon Lake series were only available with 2 Palm Cove cores and launched exclusively for Crimson Canyon NUC and later for some low-power laptops. The engineering board pictured below is obviously not meant for NUC Mini-PC and it looks a bit unusual with such a small CPU in the center. However all these connectors were used for internal validation at Intel labs.

Intel Cannon Lake is no longer supported. Last year the company even removed graphics driver support for the series because no Cannon Lake with integrated GPU has ever been shipped.

He continued to lament that America had ‚Äúnow become one of those countries corrupt at a level not seen before‚Äù.

Trump‚Äôs son Donald Trump Jr chimed in on Twitter with the assessment: ‚ÄúThis is what you see happen in 3rd World Banana Republics!!!‚Äù Never mind that the FBI‚Äôs seizure of secret documents does not fit the ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù bill quite as well as some other characteristics of American democracy: say the fact that non-taxpaying billionaires can be president or that the country is run as a crooked oligarchic corporatocracy.

This is not the first time Trump has likened the US to a ‚Äúthird-world country‚Äù which was also his epithet of choice when he lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden. But Trump & Co are not the only members of the US ruling elite to exercise this vocabulary. The January 2021 attack on the US Capitol prompted a surge in pejorative ‚Äúthird world‚Äù and ‚Äúbanana republic‚Äù comparisons from everyone from Biden to George W Bush former US leader and civilised ravager of Afghanistan and Iraq.

Indeed it is impossible to understate the bipartisan imperial hubris that is on display in the casual deployment of such lingo. By implicitly and unironically mocking underdeveloped nations the US political establishment appears to have conveniently forgotten the country‚Äôs own historical role in creating the ‚Äúbanana republic‚Äù phenomenon in the first place ‚Äî and in ensuring that the ‚Äúthird world‚Äù remains you know ‚Äúthird‚Äù.

The term ‚Äúbanana republic‚Äù was coined in 1904 by American writer O Henry in reference to the Central American nation of Honduras which like neighbouring Guatemala was an early victim of predatory US capitalism and corporate exploitation. The economic and physical wellbeing of the inhabitants of such lowly nations was naturally of no concern to the hemispheric behemoth which ensured its unfettered access to regional resources by backing right-wing coups bloody civil wars corrupt dictatorships and death squads ‚Äî in other words stuff that was slightly more devastating than an FBI search of Mar-a-Lago.

The Cold War of course provided a handy alibi for US-backed killing worldwide from Nicaragua to Angola ‚Äî while also spawning the ‚Äúthird-world‚Äù designation that would go on to accrue patronising connotations. Once the communist menace had been replaced with the terrorist menace as the primary US excuse for lethal international interference the remaining global superpower continued to extend a charitable hand to the impoverished ‚Äúthird world‚Äù ‚Äî often via a form of corporate neocolonialism cast as ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù.

And while Trump‚Äôs recent tantrum about the US as a ‚Äúbroken third-world‚Äù country can certainly be filed under the expansive category of Distastefully Kooky Things Trump Has Said there is also an unintended element of truth to it. Like it or not the US fits the third-world stereotype in many respects ‚Äî and not just in terms of its oligarchic style of governance.

The US advertises itself as being at the vanguard of global ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù but the nation‚Äôs healthcare poverty and other indicators suggest a policy of wilful counterdevelopment instead. Back in 2017 Philip Alston the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights visited the US for two weeks. At the end of his trip he issued a statement on how he found the country ‚Äúexceptional in ‚Ä¶ ways that are shockingly at odds with its immense wealth and its founding commitment to human rights‚Äù.

Despite managing to spend more money on ‚Äúnational defence‚Äù than China Russia the United Kingdom and a bunch of other big spenders combined the US had some ‚Äú40 million people‚Äù living in poverty amid glaring ‚Äúcontrasts between private wealth and public squalor‚Äù.

As Alston noted the US was also ‚Äúalone among developed countries‚Äù in insisting that human rights did ‚Äúnot include rights that guard against dying of hunger dying from a lack of access to affordable healthcare or growing up in a context of total deprivation‚Äù. So much for that line from the US Declaration of Independence about ‚Äúinalienable‚Äù rights to ‚Äúlife liberty and the pursuit of happiness‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard to pursue anything if you‚Äôre dead.

Speaking of death infant mortality rates in the US are higher than in Cuba an island that has spent more than 60 years under an asphyxiating US embargo. Trump himself imposed no fewer than 243 new sanctions against the Cubans ‚Äî as punishment for their crime of pursuing national sovereignty over the ‚Äúbanana republic‚Äù model ‚Äî and for good measure threw Cuba back on the US list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Back in the land of the free meanwhile homelessness has reached ghastly levels unseen even in many ‚Äúunderdeveloped‚Äù countries and the US has long maintained the highest incarceration rate in the world ‚Äî although it may have recently been surpassed by El Salvador another place where US support for ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù has involved backing right-wing state terror.

Such is the ironic nature of imperial power it seems that the global hegemon responsible for oppressing much of the third world must also keep a significant portion of its own populace in third-world conditions.

As per Trump‚Äôs twisted logic any attempt to hold him accountable for anything is evidence that the US is a ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù and ‚Äúbroken third-world‚Äù country. And while there‚Äôs no sense in wasting time on Trumpian delusion we might nonetheless take the opportunity to recall that old saying about the broken clock ‚Äî and to acknowledge that the US is definitively broken.

Exchange traded funds are proving a rare ray of light for under-fire active fund managers as mutual funds are decimated by a toxic cocktail of investment losses and unprecedented outflows.

Globally investors pulled a net $640bn from actively managed mutual funds in the first half of the year according to figures from Morningstar a far cry from inflows of $943bn in 2021. Combined with market falls these outflows sent total assets spinning 19.6 per cent lower to $23.9tn.

However the far smaller but more nascent active ETF industry managed to attract a net $51.8bn in the same period according to Morningstar in line with its 2021 run rate. Even factoring in market losses aggregate assets have still managed to tick up 1.2 per cent to $385bn.

Demand for active ETFs is holding up even better than for passive funds with global flows into passive mutual funds and ETFs in H1 at $431bn less than a third of 2021‚Äôs full-year tally.

‚ÄúThere has been a general trend away from mutual funds towards equity ETFs more broadly and active ETFs have very much participated in that move‚Äù said Chris Gooch head of ETF and index sales Emea at Citi.

Elisabeth Kashner director of global fund analytics at FactSet a data provider believed that in the US by far the largest market for active ETFs the rise of these beasts was ‚Äústructural‚Äù.

Kashner said growth had been stimulated by the ‚ÄúETF rule‚Äù introduced by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 which was designed to stimulate competition in the industry by streamlining the process of bringing ETFs to market.

A second driver was the SEC‚Äôs approval the same year of non-transparent and semi-transparent structures which allowed active managers to avoid having to disclose the full contents of their funds on a daily basis allowing them to keep some of their ‚Äúsecret sauce‚Äù.

More recently still the rise of active ETFs has been catalysed by some fund houses such as Dimensional Fund Advisors and JPMorgan converting existing mutual funds into ETFs.

Another factor is the adverse tax treatment mutual fund investors investing outside tax-exempt structures receive in the US ‚Äî they not only have to pay capital gains tax when they exit a position but are also taxed when their fund has to sell winning positions because other investors have exited.

Due to a quirk in their structure ETFs are immune to this latter element although this can lead to higher tax bills when investors do sell.

Although the accelerating pace of fund conversions is an increasingly important part of the story in the US they do not explain the full picture.

While the combined assets of active equity ETFs in the US rose by 35.5 per cent in the first six months of 2022 FactSet said growth was still 23.1 per cent when conversions were stripped out.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of asset managers that have determined that the ETF is the path forward the way of growing their business or slowing the decay of their business so there has been a big push from the management side‚Äù Kashner said.

However as she pointed out all of this explains rising supply but it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt explain why people have bought‚Äù active ETFs.

On the demand side of the equation she said Dimensional which attracted 54.4 per cent of net flows into active ETFs targeting the broad US stock market had ‚Äúa very loyal following especially among the adviser community‚Äù.

Dimensional also has lower fees for its ETFs than its comparable mutual funds ‚Äî a common scenario reflecting the lower cost of running an ETF ‚Äî and advisers‚Äô fiduciary duty ‚Äúis to go into the lowest-cost product‚Äù.

Moreover Kashner believed asset managers that offered both types of vehicle were increasingly ‚Äúturning their marketing muscle on their ETF product‚Äù.

‚Äú[Active ETFs] are another space‚Äù said Kenneth Lamont senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar. ‚ÄúActive management has been squeezed. It‚Äôs trying to find new ways to invent itself. There is a lot of incentive and a lot of money behind finding a way to make active work.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new marketing tool a way to present yourself to a new audience. It‚Äôs opportunistic it‚Äôs active managers trying to piggyback on the growth of ETFs.‚Äù

Amin Rajan chief executive of Create Research a think-tank believed ‚Äúa lot‚Äù of the growth was driven by institutional investors.

‚ÄúThey want to remain as liquid as they possibly can. At the same time if there are any themes they want to pursue ETFs really provide a great opportunity to capitalise on any momentum that is happening.

‚ÄúIts very much part of a structural change moving away from mutual funds‚Äù Rajan added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs happening globally but it‚Äôs much more noticeable in the US.‚Äù

Gooch believed the trend had much further to run. ‚ÄúETFs won‚Äôt completely replace mutual funds or other wrappers such as direct indexing but there is much further to go with active ETFs still only representing a small percentage of the overall ETF market‚Äù he said.

The relative success of active ETFs may help asset managers‚Äô bottom lines less than they might have hoped however.

In the US active total equity market ETF sector issuers whose fees averaged 0.16 per cent or less attracted three-quarters of inflows in H1 FactSet found led by Dimensional‚Äôs cheap offerings with those charging 0.4 per cent or more accounting for just 11 per cent of flows.

‚ÄúInvestor preferences for low-cost active equity ETFs show the challenge that today‚Äôs competitive landscape poses for asset managers‚Äù Kashner said. ‚ÄúWhile differentiated strategies may launch at higher costs competition will erode initial profit margins until the investors have captured virtually all the surplus. The only question is how long it takes.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDI5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FjdG9yLWdhcnktYnVzZXktY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLXNleC1jcmltZXMtYXQtbW9uc3Rlci1tYW5pYS1jb27SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gyOS5jb20vbmV3cy9hY3Rvci1nYXJ5LWJ1c2V5LWNoYXJnZWQtd2l0aC1zZXgtY3JpbWVzLWF0LW1vbnN0ZXItbWFuaWEtY29uLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Actor Gary Busey charged with sex crimes at Monster-Mania Con,"article

Gary Busey has been charged with sexual offenses at a New Jersey fan convention this month.

The 78-year-old Malibu California resident was charged Friday with two counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual contact one count of attempted criminal sexual contact and one count of harassment Cherry Hill police said Saturday.

The charges stem from offenses at the annual Monster Mania Convention at the Doubletree Hotel on Aug. 12-14 in Cherry Hill a Philadelphia suburb police said.

The actor was scheduled as a featured guest for all three days of the event.

Police did not identify the suspect as the actor giving an age and hometown that matched those of the actor. An email was sent to them seeking confirmation of the identification and other details.

It wasn‚Äôt immediately clear if the suspect had an attorney and a representative for the actor didn‚Äôt immediately return a message seeking comment Saturday.

Busey is widely known as a character actor largely in supporting roles though he came to attention and was nominated for an Oscar for best actor for playing the title role in the 1978 film ""The Buddy Holly Story.""",,,

Given the widespread global presence of this ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.

In the current era of a tightly interconnected global economy the proficiency of a company to penetrate international markets significantly influences its financial health and trajectory of growth. For investors the key is to grasp how reliant a company is on overseas markets as this provides insights into the durability of its earnings its ability to exploit different economic cycles and its overall growth capabilities.

Being present in international markets serves as a counterbalance to domestic economic challenges while offering chances to engage with more rapidly evolving economies. However this kind of diversification introduces challenges like currency fluctuations geopolitical uncertainties and varying market trends.

Upon examining IFF's recent quarterly performance we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts.

The company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $2.9 billion marking a decrease of 4.2% from the year-ago quarter. We will next turn our attention to dissecting IFF's international revenue to get a clearer picture of how significant its operations are outside its main base.

Trends in IFF's Revenue from International Markets

Europe Africa and Middle East accounted for 33.7% of the company's total revenue during the quarter translating to $977 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of +2.38% with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $954.31 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year Europe Africa and Middle East contributed $876 million (32.4%) and $1.07 billion (35.4%) to the total revenue respectively.

Story continues

Of the total revenue $374 million came from Latin America during the last fiscal quarter accounting for 12.9%. This represented a surprise of +1.47% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $368.57 million to the total revenue. In comparison the region contributed $372 million or 13.8% and $364 million or 12% to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters respectively.

Greater Asia generated $682 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter constituting 23.5% of the total. This represented a surprise of +2.6% compared to the $664.7 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively in the previous quarter Greater Asia accounted for $646 million (23.9%) and in the year-ago quarter it contributed $688 million (22.7%) to the total revenue.

Revenue Projections for Overseas Markets

The current fiscal quarter's total revenue for International Flavors as projected by Wall Street analysts is expected to reach $2.82 billion reflecting a decline of 3.9% from the same quarter last year. The breakdown of this revenue by foreign region is as follows: Europe Africa and Middle East is anticipated to contribute 33% or $928.14 million Latin America 12.7% or $358.47 million and Greater Asia 23% or $646.47 million.

For the full year a total revenue of $11 billion is expected for the company reflecting a decline of 4.1% from the year before. The revenues from Europe Africa and Middle East Latin America and Greater Asia are expected to make up 33.8% 13.1% and 23.6% of this total corresponding to $3.72 billion $1.44 billion and $2.59 billion respectively.

Key Takeaways

The dependency of International Flavors on global markets for its revenues presents a mix of potential gains and hazards. Thus monitoring the trends in its overseas revenues can be a key indicator for predicting the firm's future performance.

In an environment where global interconnections and geopolitical skirmishes are intensifying Wall Street analysts keep a keen eye on these trends particularly for firms with overseas operations to adjust their earnings predictions. Moreover a range of other aspects including how a company fares in its home country significantly affects these projections.

The contingency of warming effects on plant biomass via soil moisture (Supplementary Fig. 5) might be one of the primary reasons for the upregulation of R/S in many study sites except for the tundra and alpine biomes where soils are often frozen1732. Even in the studies with decreased total plant biomass in response to warming we found that belowground biomass allocations were higher than aboveground ones (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7)3334. Such a plant strategy can have important implications for soil carbon dynamics potentially due to a lower turnover rate of root-associated carbon (i.e. carbon in hyphae and root per se) compared to shoot-associated carbon3334. Biomes with lower original R/S at ambient conditions showed greater allocation to belowground biomass when warming most likely had induced greater demand for resources35 agreeing with our hypothesis of horizontal homogenization of R/S across biomes in a warmer world (Fig. 1). We suspect that the upregulated R/S due to warming might alter the carbon transfer between atmosphere and soil2136.

More specifically our results suggest that in areas with mean annual precipitation (MAP) lower than ‚àº900 mm warmed air and soil surface could induce greater belowground biomass allocation potentially for plants to exploit resources in deeper soil layers where water is more readily available and temperature is cooler (Fig. 7a)37. The long-term adaptation of plants to water deficiency e.g. a higher water use efficiency ensures more biomass accumulation under warmed conditions thereby triggering an upregulation of R/S (Fig. 7a and prolonging the C residence time in plants38. In areas with MAP greater than ‚àº900 mm adequate soil moisture could enable positive effects of warming on nutrient turnover and availability e.g. soil NH 4 + and NO 3 ‚àí for AMF and EMF respectively (Fig. 7b)1539. Indeed the allocation to belowground biomass in these areas declined consequently in our meta-analysis but only for terrestrial plants associated with AMF (Fig. 7b)40.

Fig. 7: Illustration of our main finding of warming effects on plant total biomass above- and belowground biomass and root:shoot ratio. a Biomes with low mean annual precipitation (MAP) irrespective of mycorrhizal association. b Biomes with high MAP and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) or ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF).

The up- and downward arrows indicate significant increment and decrement of a response variable (p-value < 0.05) whereas ‚Äúns‚Äù indicates non-significant changes under warmed conditions. ‚Äú~‚Äù corresponds to no change and ‚Äú?‚Äù indicates not known. Full size image

The regulation of MAP on R/S under warmed conditions was mainly through the adjustment of belowground biomass accumulation (Supplementary Fig. 3) which responded to variable effects of warming on soil moisture among plant functional types (PFTs Supplementary Fig. 6)1241. Significant changes in belowground biomass (BGB) in response to warming indeed varied among PFTs compared to other categories used in our meta-analysis (Supplementary Table 5). Woody plants which are characterized by deeper and evolutionarily mature roots42 can redistribute soil water by hydraulic lift supporting an increment in BGB under warmed conditions (Fig. 5)43. Herbaceous plants which are characterized by evolutionarily younger roots relative to woody plants can potentially adjust root traits (e.g. specific root length) more readily than biomass1241. These warming-induced changes in root traits may have contributed to their non-significant responses in terms of BGB under warmed conditions (Fig. 5). In addition to MAP due to interaction between temperature and soil moisture antecedent mean annual temperature (MAT) was another important background climatic factor influencing the response of R/S in our meta-analysis44. For instance MAT displayed a negative relationship with R/S due to a warming-induced significant increment of aboveground biomass (AGB) in most of the biomes with MAT < 13 ¬∞C and plants associated with EMF (Supplementary Table 3)45.

Plant‚Äôs association with mycorrhizal fungi further regulated biomass allocation patterns of terrestrial plants in response to warming. The response of R/S to warming among 164 vascular host plants displayed a significant phylogenetic signal (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2) whereas significant differences were not found between evergreen vs. deciduous trees broad vs. coniferous trees annual vs. perennial plants and angiosperms vs. gymnosperms (Supplementary Table 4). Although both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF-) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF-) associated plants exhibited an overall increase in R/S the underlying mechanisms are likely to be different (Figs. 5 7). Benefiting from hydrolytic and oxidative extracellular enzymes produced by the hyphae of EMF46 EMF-associated plants are capable of growing better under nutrient-deficient conditions relative to AMF-associated plants1345. EMF-associated plants showed an increasing trend of AGB BGB and R/S under warming (Fig. 5) likely due to hyphal-facilitated soil organic matter (SOM) degradation and root nutrient absorption47. By contrast AMF-associated plants are often more abundant in warmer sites (e.g. in temperate grasslands and deciduous forests) with drier soils48495051. Although AMF association correlated with greater water use efficiency in plants under warmed conditions (WUE Supplementary Fig. 7) AMF-associated plants seemed to slow down the shoot biomass accumulation due to warming-induced soil water deficiency (mainly in grasses Supplementary Fig. 9)52 and the potential increment of plant-derived carbon to AMF53. Interestingly the regulation of mycorrhizal fungi types on responses of R/S to warming were mainly related to shoot biomass but not to root biomass (Fig. 6) implying the important roles of mycorrhizal associations on aboveground biomass allocation in terrestrial plants in a warmer world245455.

As for biomes with mixed AMF and EMF (AM-EMF Fig. 5 Supplementary Fig. 8) the complementary resource use (e.g. water and nutrients) between plants with arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi provides a plausible explanation for the observed stability of R/S and higher productivity in response to warming (Fig. 4)5657. As we did not find any significant differences in plant biomass allocation (R/S) or biomass itself (AGB and BGB) to warming between evergreen vs. deciduous trees broad vs. coniferous trees annual vs. perennial plants or angiosperms vs. gymnosperms (Supplementary Table 4) when we ignored the types of mycorrhizal fungi in our analysis it further confirms the importance of plants‚Äô association with mycorrhizal fungi in understanding their biomass responses to warming compared to many other plant biotic characteristics.

We suspect that a stronger association of warming effects on biomass allocation with MAP and mycorrhizal associations could potentially lead to a redistribution of R/S in the horizontal dimension with more homogenization and lower variability of biomass allocation patterns among diverse biomes (Fig. 1)58. Although we found some clear signals in how warming effects were observed through a greater allocation of root biomass in terrestrial plants relative to shoot biomass we caution readers about the variability in effect sizes which could be caused by the distinct effect of warming magnitude and warming duration in a given biome (Supplementary Table 3). For example warming magnitude might negatively affect the response of R/S for biomes with EMF while warming duration could induce negative and positive effects for biomes with woody and herbaceous plants respectively as revealed in our analysis (Supplementary Table 3).

In summary climate warming with a mean magnitude of 2.5 ¬∞C can enhance belowground biomass allocation as a whole but mainly so in drier habitats. The warming of 2.5 ¬∞C also resembles the predicted IPCC warming (2.4 ¬∞C rise of global mean temperature) under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) in the following decades (2041‚Äì2060)59 making our results further relevant for the future of terrestrial carbon dynamics. Our results highlight that habitat dryness (or wetness) and types of mycorrhizal association are crucial factors to consider when we aim to predict biomass allocation strategies in terrestrial plants in response to warming across biomes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc3AubmdvL2Fib3V0LXVzL2luc3Atbm9ydGgtYW1lcmljYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,INSP North America,"INSP North America is a program working to support new and existing street papers in Canada Mexico and the United States.

The weekly chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ shows a strong rally off the June 15 bottom and is now hitting major Fibonacci resistance at both the 50% and 61.8% retracement levels from the recent high and pullback.

The next two weeks will be very important to determine how the NASDAQ 100 and other major indices will play out directionally given the earnings macroeconomic and geopolitical catalysts in the near-term.

The price action is showing there is a twin tower candle pattern setup with the 20-week simple moving average (SMA) that is currently flattening out. If the price action finds support at the 20-week SMA in the next few sessions and bounces then further upside is possible.

However from the opposing perspective this has all the hallmarks of a traditional harmonic ABCD pattern to the downside. The initial ABCD was made from the recent high to low (Jan. 3 ‚Äì June 15) which also corresponds to the longer AB leg and a descending wedge pattern.

More recently the price action is within the longer BC leg. If the price action were to reverse the 200-week SMA (orange line on chart) would act as the first area of support and if the trend continues thereafter traders and investors would see a potential move lower.

Bitcoin has seen 3 legs lower on the daily time frame since its April highs where the 200-day SMA acted as strong resistance. As of late the price action has been in a major consolidation phase since mid-June and Friday‚Äôs price action saw a large red Maruboza candle off the 20-day SMA which history suggest has an over 80% chance of follow through to the downside.

A simple rule of thumb is within a trending market 3-5 legs are created in the direction of the current trend around 70% of the time before a potential reversal.

Taking a peek at the weekly chart Friday‚Äôs price action gave a strong signal for potential further downside as a bearish engulfing candle was made and broke below both the 200-week SMA.

Price is still within the upper 50% of the consolidating range but a continued breakdown below the 200-week SMA could signal a potential free fall and mass liquidation by institutions. The longer term ABCD pattern to the downside is still intact.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL2hiY3UvZm9vdGJhbGwvYnlyb24tYWxsZW4taGlzdG9yaWMtZGVhbHMtc3dhYy1jaWFhLWxvbmctb3ZlcmR1ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Byron Allen: 'Historic Deal' HBCU GO Deals With the SWAC CIAA 'Long Overdue',"HOUSTON TX ‚Äî Byron Allen believes his Allen Media Group's free-streaming digital platform HBCU Go's partnership with the SWAC and CIAA are landmark deals. Few can disagree.

The significance is profound for these governing long-standing HBCU sports entities founded over 100 years ago ‚Äî Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 1912 and Southwestern Athletic Conference in 1920. Corporate America and major broadcast networks have ignored or failed to recognize the economic benefit of affiliating with HBCU conferences.

For example State Farm Procter & Gamble United Wells Fargo Invesco QQQ Tyson Foods and Cricket Wireless are a few corporations that sponsored HBCU-related sporting events. Nevertheless the record with the three and four-letter broadcast networks has an underwhelming track record with HBCUs ‚Äî for many a year.

AN HBCU GO-TYPE PARTNERSHIP 'LONG OVERDUE'

The SWAC arrangement with HBCU GO is a ""long-term partnership to amplify and grow the sports floor program"" Byron Allen told me. ""This is the long overdue support to help them get the exposure the revenue they need to help fund these programs the schools and ultimately the education of these kids. It's a very important deal and historic deal.""

For HBCU conferences history may point back to 2022 as when media outlets began acknowledging the value of partnering with the brands of Jackson State Florida A&M Grambling Southern Howard Southern or South Carolina State. Then again eradicating the years of disenfranchisement by the suits on Madison Avenue would require the commissioners presidents and athletic directors to make transformational decisions for these brands.

HBCUs have had three choices served to them over the years. One we won't do business with you. Two we will pacify you with a spattering of support - just enough to keep you quiet. Third the corporate boardrooms will invite HBCUs to the table and strike new lucrative deals.

Question. Are we there yet?

COMPARE OR NOT COMPARE THAT IS THE QUESTION

After this week's mega-announcement of the Big 10's $7 billion television rights deal with FOX CBS and NBC are the HBCU conferences on the precipice of leaping into similar long-term accords?

The media mogul remarked how he was ""very proud of"" inking the multi-year contract with the SWAC but would not disclose the financial terms of the new alliance. ""I can't share the details. But it is a long-term partnership that we are both [SWAC and HBCU GO] very excited about"" Allen stated.

One source told me it's a 10-year $120 million agreement between the SWAC and HBCU GO. I contacted the SWAC conference office to verify the details. A representative would only confirm that the SWAC signed a multi-year distribution contract with Allen's free-streaming platform.

Allen affirmed a few particulars from our first conversation in February 2022. ""We did a deal with them [SWAC] for over 2000 live-sporting events. That's football men's and women's basketball men's and women's volleyball other sports; it's everything the entire spectrum.""

HOW HBCUs WILL BE WATCHED WITH HBCU GO CBS

On August 16 Allen Media Group officially announced after signing separate distribution partnerships with the SWAC and CIAA that HBCU GO will distribute the conferences' content via CBS-owned-and-operated duopoly stations. Also HBCU GO has secured distribution with group-owned television stations including Nexstar Gray Cox Scripps Tegna Sinclair Lockwood Allen Media Broadcasting Hearst Circle City Broadcasting McKinnon Broadcasting Cowles Graham Block Sun Broadcasting Tougaloo College Sagamore Hill and Marquee.

""These games will be some of the very first games that will be on digital broadcast and cable simultaneously"" Allen noted. ""So this will be on the streaming app HBCU GO and the Grio streaming app Local Now SPORTS.TV and over-the-air broadcast. That's the syndication we've put together to align them for broadcast television stations with CBS being the lead group. Nexstar Gray Cox Scripps Tegna Sinclair Lockwood Allen Media Broadcasting Hearst Circle City Broadcasting McKinnon Broadcasting Cowles Graham Block Sun Broadcasting Tougaloo College Sagamore Hill and Marquee and our cable network. The Grio has 50 plus million homes available to 50 plus million homes.""

A few weeks ago AMG (Allen Media Group) acquired the Black News Channel (BCN) and its assets for a reported $11 million out of bankruptcy. Allen converted and merged BCN into The Grio. ""Anybody who wants to see an HBCU game will not have any problems accessing them via digital via over-the-air broadcast and via cable. It's 100% penetration across the board collectively"" Allen declared.

HBCU GO's IMPACT AND REACH FOR THE SWAC AND CIAA

The SWAC and CIAA grant HBCU GO the rights to their conferences' sporting events to broadcast via cable linear streaming broadcast VOD [video-on-demand} and pay-per-view. Syndication becomes a possibility for HBCU GO to be packaged in future deals for distribution on other networks. For clarity neither AMG Allen nor the SWAC verified with HBCU Legends that the conferences would or would not receive revenue from syndication of their content on HBCU GO.

Byron Allen mentioned the CBS deal would place HBCU GO in ""approximately 60% of all US households and approximately 67% of all African American households.""

The HBCU GO platform will have a global reach for HBCU sports fans to access games and events.

Even Jackson State's head coach understands how this will impact the families of the young men on his football team. Deion Sanders was very candid with Allen and told him ""We need some support. These young kids are here and they want their mamas to see them play. So we're help them to make sure their mamas can see them play"" Allen exclaimed.

ARE HBCUs NOW IN A POSITION OF POWER?

""We've gone from zero to now a deal has been done. Is it a multi-billion dollar deal? It is not. Have they [HBCUs] been there and available for over a century and decades? Yes. Have they been ignored? Yes. We are starting the process of reversing that.""

Allen continued ""The greatest trade deficit in America is the trade deficit between White corporate America and Black America. Why is it that Byron Allen in 2022 becomes the first person to take the sports content put it on digital broadcast and cable and push the conversation to provide distribution and economic inclusion for the HBCUs? Some pretty big corporations out there that didn't seem to care before now.""

He's correct. HBCUs are now sexy for the advertising agencies to seek new partnerships and promote the so-called ""black agenda"" to their clients' consumers. As compelling as it seems business and profitability must become the central concerns for the SWAC CIAA MEAC CIAC and other HBCU conferences and their member institutions.

Should HBCUs and their fans applaud these deals today later or at all?

It's not for me to say.

One thing is clear. Now is the time for the conferences to capitalize and take a position of power to dictate the new partnership terms. If they do not it will be same ol' business as usual for historically black colleges and universities.

In our conversation Byron Allen told me that Dr. Martin Luther King's widow Coretta Scott King once shared this wise statement. ""The greatest weapon we have is the truth.""

Will the truth set HBCUs free to control and navigate the economics of their media rights and future deals? Will commissioners Dr. Charles McClelland (SWAC) and Jacqie McWilliams (CIAA) keep their respective conferences protected and profitable? And will HBCU GO help to revolutionize HBCU sports in the SWAC and CIAA? Once again Byron Allen believes it would.

We shall see.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc3RvY2tuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3FxcS1hYXBsLW1zZnQtdnhuLXZpeC1ob3ctb3B0aW9uLXByaWNlcy1jYW4taGVscC1wcmVkaWN0LWZ1dHVyZS1zdG9jay1wcmljZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,QQQ: How Option Prices Can Help Predict Future Stock Prices,"I highlighted last week some reasons why I thought stocks and particularly QQQ had finally formed a significant top in my latest commentary for POWR Options. One of the biggest reasons why the NASDAQ looks tired and toppy was complacency-which was reflected in the form of option prices.

Most of you are probably very familiar with the VIX-sometimes called the ‚ÄúFear Index‚Äù. The VIX is a general measure of 30-day option prices on the S&P 500. It tends to spike when stock prices fall sharply and usually falls when stock prices rise.

VXN or Vixen is a similar measure of 30-day option prices using the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) instead of the S&P 500 (SPY). Let‚Äôs take a look at how using the VXN as a market timing tool can help call significant short-term tops in the market. It is the equivalent of the Warren Buffett adage that says to ‚ÄúBe Fearful When Others Are Greedy.‚Äù

VXN sell signals are generated when VXN makes at least a 33% pullback from the previous high and then makes a reversal off the lows. Over the past 12 months there have been 6 such sell signals generated (highlighted in aqua on the chart below)

Below is the same time period 1 year chart of the QQQ. Note how the bottoms in VXN correspond precisely with the tops in QQQ (highlighted in red) .

I put together a quick snapshot summary of the VXN based sell signal methodology over the past year shown in the table below.

Price of sell Subsequent low Gain % gain Date of low Days to low 8/31/2021 379.95 352.62 27.33 7.19% 10/4/2021 34 11/5/2021 398.6 380.69 17.91 4.49% 12/20/2021 45 1/4/2022 396.47 341.4 55.07 13.89% 1/27/2022 23 2/10/2022 358.43 318.17 40.26 11.23% 3/14/2022 32 4/5/2022 361.1 291.15 69.95 19.37% 5/12/2022 37 6/8/2022 307.4 271.39 36.01 11.71% 6/16/2022 8 11.32% 29.83

The average pullback over the past six sell signals has been just over 11%. It has taken about a month (29.83 days on average) for stocks to find a subsequent bottom after the sell signal was generated.

Just as importantly the sell signals never really were too early or wrong in calling a short-term top. None of the prior six signals would have caused any subsequent angst by using the VXN methodology as a market timing tool. Indeed only one of the signals had a minor unrealized loss after taking a short position in the QQQ. The other five were pretty much spot on in calling the top.

Using the VXN methodology means the market will tell you when it is time to act. This can be important as many time fundamental analysis and technical analysis can be way too early‚Ä¶which in this market environment makes it difficult to hang on to a losing position for too long.

That‚Äôs not to say that fundamentals and other factors aren‚Äôt important as confirming indicators to take a bearish stance.

Both valuations and seasonality are also pointing to the probabilities favoring a pullback.

The two biggest market cap stocks in the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) are Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Both reached the highest multiples on a Price/Sales basis over the past three months before softening. Plus having 2 trillion-dollar plus market cap companies trading at such lofty valuations seems extreme unto itself. Further upside seems limited at best.

Seasonality supports the bearish argument as well.

Over the past twelve years September has been the only down month for QQQ. Shares have shown gains less than half the time with an average loss of 1%. Every other month is positive on both performance and number of up months versus down months.

Comparative performance is also favoring a bigger pullback for QQQ versus SPY. Normally QQQ and SPY tend to be highly correlated. Over the past few months however QQQ has out-performed SPY to a large degree. Look for this correlation to revert back to the mean with QQQ beginning to under-perform to close that gap.

Comparative lows in the VXN also means option prices on the QQQ are comparatively cheap. This favors buying puts to take a defined risk short position. Exactly the type of strategy we use week-in and week-out in the POWR Options Portfolio.

So traders looking to take a short position for the short-term would be best served buying puts versus shorting QQQ outright. Limited risk with potentially explosive returns. Plus an increase in implied volatility generally will be a benefit to the long put position as well.

Nicknamed ‚ÄúCOVID-pandemic‚Äôs favourite snack‚Äù and the source of multiple social media memes Dolo-650 mg which registered a sales of over ‚Çπ500 crores during the COVID pandemic since March 2020 is back in the news following the public interest litigation in Supreme Court by the Federation of Medical and Sales Representatives Association of India (FMRAI) a national trade union that sought enforcement of Right to Life under Article 21 of the Constitution.

In its petition FMRAI has alleged mounting instances of unethical marketing practices by pharma companies in their dealings with healthcare professionals which in turn has a negative effect on the health of those who are already unwell.

‚ÄúThe existing code is voluntary and unethical practices will continue to proliferate. The ultimate sufferer is the ailing patient for whom we are fighting. We demand that all essential medicines be brought under price control and be made tax free. This will ensure that patients are directly benefited. No one should die for want of medicines‚Äô‚Äô said Santanu Chatterjee of FMRAI.

‚ÄúThis current case is certainly not about Dolo-650 alone. It is just one of the examples cited. Paracetamol is one of the examples that we have referred to in the petition that was filed some years ago. We are working for bringing in regulations that would stop malpractice in the pharma industry‚Äô‚Äô said Aparna Bhat advocate for FMRAI.

The advocate explained that government price control is applicable till 500 mg of the paracetamol salt. ‚ÄúThe idea of Dolo-650 and freebie caught on because it is so widely used especially during COVID. Also it was in the news in July‚Äô‚Äô she added.

As per data available with IQVIA a healthcare research firm Dolo-650 mg registered sales of ‚Çπ28.9 crore in December 2021 up 61.45% from the same month the previous year. Its highest sales figures are from April and May 2021 when it witnessed sales of ‚Çπ48.9 crore and ‚Çπ44.2 crore respectively. The growth was when the country was witnessing the second wave of COVID.

Dolo-650 is one brand of paracetamol also known as acetaminophen and used to treat fever and mild to moderate pain. It is manufactured by Micro Labs Ltd. and is no different from other brands like Crocin Calpol Pacimol etc. However unlike Dolo-650 mg most other brands sell their paracetamol brand with 500 mg salt. Data from IQVIA also show that Dolo-650 and Calpol (manufactured by GSK Pharmaceuticals) are the key brands driving the paracetamol segment.

In all there are over 30 brands of paracetamol that are top-sellers in different regions of India.

Unethical practices

While the Supreme Court is now scheduled to take up the matter on September 29 earlier this month the National Medical Commission (NMC) sought details from the Income Tax Department of doctors who allegedly received freebies from six pharma companies including Dolo-650 maker Micro Labs against whom raids were conducted last month.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) the administrative body for the I-T department in July had accused the makers of the widely-used Dolo-650 tablet of indulging in ‚Äúunethical practices‚Äù and distributing freebies of about ‚Çπ1000 crore to doctors and medical professionals in exchange for promoting its products.

The Income Tax department had on July 6 raided 36 premises of Bengaluru-based Micro Labs Ltd. across nine states.

‚ÄòStill safe to use‚Äô

A recent study by Future Market Insights (FMI) notes that the global acetaminophen market is expected to grow to over US$ 14.1 billion by 2031 from the US$ 9.4 billion in 2021. In such a market Dolo-650‚Äôs popularity comes with the fact that it is one of three-four familiar brands that contain the drug paracetamol what with Dolo having been around for almost three decades said Dr. Rajeev Jayadevan co-chairman national Indian Medical Association COVID task force.

‚ÄúA specific advantage of Dolo 650 is that if a single tablet is taken up to three times a day it comes well under the safe limit of 4 g per 24 hours. (More number of pills might be needed if the 500 mg strength tablet is used). So it is convenient for adults of average build and weight. I understand other leading brands also released ads about their own 650 mg versions apparently after seeing the popularity of this particular dose during the pandemic‚Äô‚Äô he explained.

Meanwhile paracetamol is considered a safe drug to use within the recommended dosage. ‚ÄúHowever in some cases you may experience side effects such as nausea vomiting indigestion diarrhoea stomach pain etc. Consult your doctor if these symptoms stay for a long time or if they become severe‚Äô‚Äô noted experts.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past twenty years Langfonne has dramatically retreated. Its current size is less than 30% of what it was 20 years ago. The retreat is evident from the surroundings. The ice is surrounded by bedrock devoid of lichen and moss and is a light gray color. Three distinct ice patches have formed from the split ice. Only 10% of the Little Ice Age‚Äôs maximum ice cover remains at Langfonne today (AD 1450-1920). The melting of Langfonne is a part of a much larger global warming-related pattern of retreating mountain glaciers that includes glaciers in Norway and other countries.

However the Langfonne ice patch is the ice site in the world with the most arrows.

Photo: The secret of the Ice Facebook page.

The arrow was discovered in a collection of broken rock fragments between larger stones on the lower edge of the icefield.

The team believes that the arrow was lost and deposited downslope by meltwater and that it has since been exposed several times by melting ice over the centuries.

This is indicated by the lack of fletching the fin-shaped aerodynamic stabilization normally made from feathers or bark. Evidence of sinew and tar has also been identified but this survives in a poor state of preservation. The arrow is tapered towards the end and the nock has been thickened for engaging with a bowstring. The remains of the tar would have glued the fletching to the shaft while imprints of the thread securing the fletching are still visible.

In recent years the team has found numerous arrows in the region during the Late Neolithic (2400-1750 BC) and especially during the Late Iron Age (AD 550-1050).

Photo: The secret of the Ice Facebook page.

The team found another arrow earlier this year in the Jotunheimen mountains which dates from around 1700 years ago. This arrow was found complete with its iron arrowhead sinew wrappings and aerodynamic feather fletching.

The project also discovered the best-preserved example of prehistoric skis a Bronze Age shoe and a lost Viking settlement containing sleds dead animals clothing and household items in melting ice patches.

On their Facebook page you can keep up with the project‚Äôs development and updates.

On either side of her an animation of the sun and the earth slowly rotated and the screens swiftly seamlessly closed after she stepped out to sing her first song of the night ‚ÄúNat King Cole.‚Äù

The audience erupted with cheers cell phones popping into the air. Keys instantly commanded the crowd before she sang a note or struck a single piano key at her concert Friday night in Cleveland.

Sure she was standing in front of an audience of 5000 but the singer also found ways to get in front of most attendees. She popped up at a small side stage next to the seated floor crowd for a few songs and later strutted her way around the venue‚Äôs main path to access every section of the audience.

Her unique approach to getting up close and personal with the crowd felt unconventional for a venue like Jacobs Pavilion. She said her philosophy on performing went back to a key piece of advice that Prince once gave her: ‚ÄúKeep it intimate. Keep it special.‚Äù

(I mean any time you see one of the most iconic versatile R&B pop singers of all time it‚Äôs going to be special.)

The 15-time Grammy award winner achieved icon status two decades ago when she released her debut album ‚ÄúSongs in A Minor‚Äù and has only impressed in her seven albums since. That included her pandemic-time releases 2020‚Ä≤s ‚ÄúAlicia‚Äù and 2021‚Ä≤s ‚ÄúKeys.‚Äù

Combined in the celebratory ‚ÄúAlicia + Keys‚Äù world tour Keys brought attention to the new tunes but also spanned plenty of fan-favorite hits from over the years.

There were plenty of years to cover. The last time Keys had performed in Cleveland was in 2004 on the ‚ÄúVerizon Ladies First‚Äù tour and in 2005 supporting 50 Cent according to setlist.fm records.

Alicia Keys performed at Jacobs Pavilion on Friday Aug. 19. (Photo by Judie Vegh special to cleveland.com)

At her recent Cleveland stop Keys sang her impassioned hit songs ‚ÄúNo One‚Äù ‚ÄúFalling‚Äù ‚ÄúEmpire State of Mind‚Äù ‚ÄúGirl On Fire‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf I Ain‚Äôt Got You‚Äù to a crowd that sang (and often screamed) along. She regularly sat at the piano showing off her prowess of the instrument meshing her performance with her talented backing band to create soulful jazz-tinged textures.

Other times her tunes got club-friendly remix treatment. Keys performed the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù and ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù versions of some of the songs from her latest album including ‚ÄúSkydive‚Äù and ‚ÄúOnly You.‚Äù The flashy air horn-filled versions gave entire new flavors to Keys‚Äô original songs. As the bass-heavy renditions thumped the singer twisted her arms into the air under flashing lights as though she herself were dancing in a nightclub.

Keys is an artist who‚Äôs always been able to command a lot of genres and a lot of audience. (Who could forget her show-stopping 2019 Grammys performance where she played two pianos at one time?)

The only puzzling part of Friday‚Äôs show was why Keys wasn‚Äôt playing somewhere bigger as she had in the past. The light show itself would have been perfectly at home in a venue like Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse or the Wolstein Center and the packed audience could have shown up at one of those venues with more force.

But then as she made her second reference to Prince of the night (‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to celebrate this thing called life‚Äù) it became clear that Keys cared more about creating a memorable one-of-a-kind connection not only for her fans ‚Äì but also for herself.

R&B singer Pink Sweat$ paired with an acoustic guitarist performed a mix of summery R&B songs ahead of Keys‚Äô set. Often milking his time slot he asked the crowd to sing back to him clap with him and wave their arms in the air almost as much as he played music while a videographer hovered around him to capture every moment. Check out photos from his set below:

Contributed/Tom Stromme

GRAND FORKS ‚Äì The merlin earned its place as bird of the week. On Tuesday evening when I was stewing about what bird to choose a merlin suddenly appeared. This was not surprising. Merlins have been increasing in Grand Forks and other cities on the Plains. Nevertheless its appearance was fortuitous because I must decide on a bird feature by Tuesday night in order to meet a deadline for a drawing and a column. That deadline is Wednesday afternoon with an occasional grace period until first thing Thursday. All of this for publication on Saturday.

So the bird must be present ‚Äì or anticipated ‚Äì and it must be expected to hang around at least until the paper reaches subscribers‚Äô homes. The merlin qualifies.

Still the merlin is a bird of mystery.

It rather closely resembles another bird-eating raptor the Cooper‚Äôs hawk. Cooper‚Äôs hawks have increased dramatically in Grand Forks since about 2000 and the city has gained a reputation as a Cooper‚Äôs hawk hangout partly due to close observation and study by the regional raptor expert Tim Driscoll ‚Äì he of peregrine fame.

In some ways the merlin is a smaller version of the peregrine. Both are falcons. A third falcon species is common here. This is the kestrel formerly called the sparrow hawk. Similarly the merlin was referred to as ‚Äúthe pigeon hawk.‚Äù

READ MORE ABOUT BIRDWATCHING:





Neither of these names is appropriate. It‚Äôs true that kestrels might eat sparrows but they prefer small mammals. The merlin doesn‚Äôt eat pigeons but it does hunt smaller birds. The pigeon reference in its name refers to its size which roughly corresponds to the house pigeon more formally ‚Äì and correctly ‚Äì referred to as rock dove.

The size comparison really only applies to female merlins which are larger than males. This creates confusion in identification.

Re-enter the Cooper‚Äôs hawk. It is close in size to the female merlin and female merlins are paler in plumage which allows for additional confusion since Cooper‚Äôs hawks are generally lighter than male merlins.

There are ways to separate these two species at sight and I remind myself of them whenever I see either species. First the merlin is a stockier bird with a shorter tail. Of course size especially at a distance is never a definitive field mark. Better ‚Äì but seen only close up ‚Äì is the streaking on the belly of the birds. Merlins are streaked chest to tail. Cooper‚Äôs hawks are streaked from wing to wing. In my experience this is especially marked on male merlins.

The species fly slightly differently. Merlins are dashers ‚Äì and fast ones at that. This adapts them to pursuit in open areas. Cooper‚Äôs hawks maneuver very well in wooded areas. They are fast and agile in pursuit.

Merlins present still another paradox. They have suddenly become common in our area. In the 1990s they were considered rare in our area. The American Ornithological Society‚Äôs monograph on the species leaves the whole eastern part of North Dakota absent of merlins.

It‚Äôs true that we here in the Red River Valley are close to the eastern edge of the merlin range but the species has been pressing eastward and occupying cities on the Plains. This is true of Cooper‚Äôs hawks too although they are coming from other directions ‚Äì east and north.

The Cooper‚Äôs hawks got to town first. Merlins are more recent arrivals. For a couple of decades they‚Äôve been present in some numbers in our area. It‚Äôs true that our area has been at the eastern edge of the merlin‚Äôs range but they have been pressing eastward and showing up in cities. My first ‚Äúlocal sighting‚Äù was at Lake Ardoch National Wildlife Refuge in the early ‚Äô90s.

On Wednesday Aug. 17 I had an excuse for a road trip and I encountered three merlins two near Mekinock and one closer to Gilby N.D. (Yes this was a cross-country trip from Grand Forks to Magpie Ridge the country place we left to move into Grand Forks.) Merlins were consistent nesters in the last half decade in Wheatfield Township.

Both Cooper‚Äôs hawks and merlins are largely migratory but there is increasing evidence that both species spend the winter months here.

Late August brings a steady increase of species starting migration. The pool at Kellys Slough National Wildlife Refuge northwest of Grand Forks held at least 500 avocets Wednesday and I saw the first evidence of swallows massing for migration. In Grand Forks loose flocks of chipping sparrows have been flitting through the foliage along the Greenway. In nesting season these birds are generally seen individually.

Jurgen Klopp is thought to be in the market for a new midfielder to solve his midfield crisis.

As a result the Liverpool boss is weighing up a move for a midfielder before transfer deadline day.

Advert

The club are believed to be keeping tabs on Sheffield United star Sander Berge having expressed an interest in the player.

What's more Liverpool have made an 'enquiry' for Aston Villa's Ramsey according to Grizz Khan.

And local reports in Ecuador state that the Anfield outfit are 'preparing an offer' for Brighton's Caicedo.

Advert

Ramsey 21 burst onto the scene in the 2020/21 campaign and starred last season scoring six goals from midfield.

He's quickly become a key player for Steven Gerrard's team as his performances have alerted Liverpool.

As for Caicedo he's wanted by Liverpool who face competition from Manchester United.

But StudioFutbol claim the player is not interested in a move to Old Trafford.

Klopp addressed the growing demand to sign a new midfielder in the transfer window stating it's not easy to bring in the right man.

Advert

""The thing is it is easy for us to bring a midfielder in but it is not so easy to bring the right midfielder in"" he explained. ""There are money reasons and contractual reasons which most of the time go hand-in-hand.

""It's not that we deny signing a player if we have a problem with injuries for example but it is a complete different situation to the beginning of the pre-season when everybody told me we needed a new midfielder and that was about the kind of midfielder.

""That is a completely different discussion. We didn't need a different kind of midfielder but if the right midfielder would have been available we would have gone then as well.

""Now the situation has changed slightly: we have more injuries that's true. But it can still only be about the right [player] and that is not easy. It is nothing to do with that it is now August already and at the end of August the transfer window closes.

Advert

""It's just because it is 2022 and people have contracts until 2024 2025 or 2026 that's the situation and that's why we have to be calm and sort our problems with the boys we have. It's all about solutions and only one of these solutions is the transfer market all the other solutions are here.""

COLORADO SPRINGS Co. -- Downhill skier Breezy Johnson has been banned for 14 months for three violations of anti-doping rules and can't race until December.

The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency published its decision late Monday for Johnson‚Äôs failure to comply with the whereabouts rules. They oblige athletes to detail where they can be found for one hour each day to give a sample with no advance notice.

Athletes have been banned for up to two years if they have three violations in a 12-month period such as missed tests or failures to update accurate details of their location.

Johnson‚Äôs whereabouts failures were on Oct. 29 2022 then June 13 2023 and Oct. 10 2023 USADA said. A seven-time podium finisher in World Cup races she left the circuit in December while under investigation.

USADA said 14 months was an appropriate ban for the 28-year-old Johnson because her ‚Äúdegree of fault was relatively low given the circumstances of the case.‚Äù

Johnson did not race in the World Cup last season and is not scheduled to miss any races next season in her specialist downhill and super-G events before the ban expires on Dec. 9.

The USADA ruling can be challenged by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation on appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Johnson‚Äôs race career peaked in a one-year period through December 2021 when she had three runner-up finishes and four third-places in World Cup downhills.

She missed the 2022 Beijing Olympics due to a knee injury she picked up three weeks before the games.

The fine follows an inspector general investigation and a November probable cause finding from the board which Conyears-Ervin was given the opportunity to rebut in the interim. In line with ethics board policy Conyears-Ervin was not named.

‚ÄúWe have engaged in this process with seriousness and good faith and are disappointed in today‚Äôs action‚Äù Conyears-Ervin spokesman Brian Berg said in a written statement. ‚ÄúWe are evaluating all options available to us and remain confident that a fuller airing of the validity of these years old allegations and questionable actions of investigators will paint a fuller picture ‚Äî and we look forward to that day. Until then we will continue to respect what is supposed to be a confidential process.‚Äù

Monday‚Äôs fine comes on the heels of a separate $60000 penalty levied against the treasurer by the same board last month. They found on ‚Äúmultiple occasions‚Äù Conyears-Ervin violated her fiduciary duty made unauthorized uses of city property and conducted prohibited political activities according to a board summary.

The Tribune first reported on allegations made by former aides Tiffany Harper and Ashley Evans who said they were retaliated against and ultimately fired after reporting the misconduct. Former Mayor Lori Lightfoot‚Äôs administration paid out a $100000 settlement to the two then fought for roughly two years to conceal the details of their whistleblower complaint.

Mayor Brandon Johnson released that information after taking office.

Separately Chicago ethics leaders on Monday criticized Johnson for failing to fill vacancies on the city‚Äôs ethics board and an ‚Äúabrupt‚Äù pullback from plans to tighten rules for contractors and candidates for city office.

William Conlon the typically amiable chair of the seven-member Board of Ethics criticized Johnson‚Äôs slow pace to fill two vacant spots on the board which have been empty since July 2022 and March 2023.

Two other members‚Äô terms will expire this summer. If those four positions aren‚Äôt filled before the end of July the board will not have enough members to legally meet.

‚ÄúAs you can tell we are still down two members a task that can‚Äôt be that difficult‚Äù Conlon said during Monday‚Äôs board meeting. ‚ÄúWe have two members whose terms are set to expire at the end of July. Two clear-thinking independent thoughtful people who do their homework and are here participating every time. Why they have not been reappointed baffles me.‚Äù

Johnson spokesman Ronnie Reese said three candidates will be submitted for those board vacancies this month ‚Äúwith approval anticipated at the June City Council meeting.‚Äù

Steve Berlin the board‚Äôs longtime executive director added that he was ‚Äúsad to report‚Äù there were ‚Äúno current plans to hold a committee meeting or ethics committee hearing on the proposed amendments‚Äù to the city‚Äôs ethics ordinance.

Though ethics changes were legislative hallmarks of the early months of Johnson‚Äôs two predecessors the mayor has not embraced any new changes to the city‚Äôs oversight rules. Without mayoral support such changes typically wither on the vine in the City Council.

‚ÄúI know that Ald. (Matt) Martin is disappointed in this as well‚Äù Berlin said.

Martin 47th chair of the City Council Committee on Ethics and Government Oversight took up the board‚Äôs proposed changes and said they would be a priority for passage this spring. Instead the committee has canceled two scheduled meetings in recent months.

Martin told the Tribune he was ‚Äúfrustrated‚Äù about the board vacancies and confirmed there was no timeline to take up ethics reform.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that we‚Äôre yet in a place where there‚Äôs alignment across the committee and the mayor‚Äôs office‚Äù regarding ethics ordinance amendments Martin said declining to comment on the misalignment. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôll continue to work on that but I don‚Äôt have a timeline for when we might be able to take those up.‚Äù

The mayor‚Äôs office did not comment on the amendments.

The board‚Äôs proposed changes ‚Äî spurred in part by Tribune reporting ‚Äî include barring contractors who work for aldermen from getting involved in any city decisions that benefit their own financial interests or that benefit other clients or employers.

The changes would also ‚Äúmake clear that no candidate or political fundraising committee may for example send emails soliciting political contributions or campaign work to city employees or officials to their official city email addresses‚Äù a response to Mayor Lori Lightfoot‚Äôs mayoral campaign sending emails to Chicago Public Schools staff seeking student interns.

Earlier this year Johnson described those proposed reforms as ‚Äúa positive step toward a more accountable city government‚Äù but did not otherwise comment on his ethics priorities.

During Monday‚Äôs ethics board meeting Bryan Zarou policy chief for the Better Government Association said there was an ‚Äúabrupt‚Äù and ‚Äútroubling‚Äù pullback of mayoral support from the ethics amendment ordinance and he had not received a clear explanation why.

Conlon described that as an ‚Äúunfortunate surprise.‚Äù

In the meantime Martin said his committee would hold hearings on inspector general findings and audits and potentially codify an old executive order banning lobbyists from donating to the mayor.

Four registered lobbyists were initially dinged by the board for donating to Johnson‚Äôs campaign. That violated a 2011 executive order signed by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel barring such donations.

The board found though it had no authority to enforce the order nor did the city‚Äôs inspector general have power to formally investigate potential violations. The board dismissed the cases against those lobbyists.

While Johnson returned the donations and his campaign said the policy was ‚Äúsound and necessary‚Äù he said last month that codifying the rule is not something he‚Äôs ‚Äúspent a lot of time thinking about‚Äù according to WBEZ and that he would ‚Äútake another look at it.‚Äù

Hashian who is a musician previously showed off her vocal talents last Thanksgiving when she joined Johnson and musician Eric Zayne for a little session at the piano.

In a clip shared by Johnson on Instagram Zayne played the piano as Hashian sat on a chair next to him and they both belted out the lyrics to Billy Joel's ""Just the Way You Are"" with the actor joining in as he leaned over the top of the grand instrument.

""A lil‚Äô Thanksgiving tickling of the ivorys with the two beautiful voices and talents of @laurenhashianofficial & @ericzayne and me just making up lyrics to an all time classic @billyjoel"" Johnson wrote.

Businesses are facing some significant financial storms because of the high inflation numbers plus the ominous cloud of COVID-19 continues to hover overhead.

Jason Alston owner of Heavens Table BBQ 5507 W North Avenue used various strategies to weather the storm to keep his business afloat.

At Heaven‚Äôs Table BBQ you can find a variety of menu items that includes a variety of smoked meats like brisket ribs pulled pork excellent pastrami and sausage along with wings sandwiches and sides.

‚ÄúI want to start off and say COVID-19 was the first supposed disaster and the thing with business is you always have to be ready for adjustments. I learned back in culinary school when it comes to the restaurant industry even when it‚Äôs not inflation you still have prices that fluctuate up and down‚Äù said Alston.

Alston says that the restaurant business is a whole different animal.

Alston has a passion for cooking and has been cooking professionally for the last 13 years with education from MATC culinary to Cardinal Stritch to Marquette he was well trained and ready for the challenge.

Many businesses are also struggling with inflation. Raw materials and finished goods are more expensive and workers are demanding higher pay. Owners have been forced to raise prices or cut back on some services.

‚ÄúI had to raise my prices a couple of times with my product and my customers were not too happy‚Äù Alston said. ‚ÄúI also have to accommodate them too so having to raise the prices I made my sides bigger you have to justify the price increase.‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery industry is impacted a little differently from inflation that‚Äôs a general blank statement but overall there‚Äôs rising costs of materials costs of goods inventory can be affected‚Äù said Jason Engledow Business Banking Area Manager JPMorgan Chase.

‚ÄúI reached out to JP Morgan Chase for a PPP Loan when it was available. I also received a credit card. Chase offers a lot of help with conversation and would consistently ask what I needed help with‚Äù Alston said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve truly been helpful and they‚Äôre the first bank I worked with and actually haven‚Äôt had to look anywhere else for my business needs.‚Äù

JPMorgan Chase serves a variety of clients from restaurants to industrial to manufacturing to professional services.

Engledow offers tips that businesses can mitigate inflationary risks look at their excess cash flow and keep a reserve to weather the storm. Reach out to a financial advisor on how to manage their debt and how to manage vendor relationships. Focus on operations and the relationships they have with their employees and their customers.

JPMorgan Chase has been constantly investing in people and technology in the communities that they serve.

‚ÄúOne thing I‚Äôm so proud of is that sometime in 2023 we‚Äôre going to invest in a mentorship program‚Äù Engledow said. ‚ÄúWe have peer to peer free consulting to educate on business plans coaching and tools.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe want to do everything we can from Chase‚Äôs standpoint to really focus on Black entrepreneurs and how critical a role that they play the economic role of the community. This is going to be a unique program we‚Äôve launched in other cities and have had a lot of success. I‚Äôm very excited it‚Äôs coming to our market in Milwaukee sometime in 2023‚Äù Engledow said.

Remarkably some businesses have demonstrated the ability to wade through the pandemic and inflation. Businesses will have to remain attentive to keep their business afloat.

An important piece of advice from Alston ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let the circumstances right now discourage you these things happen. Whatever your dreams and passions are keep following them.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbnltYWcuY29tL2ludGVsbGlnZW5jZXIvMjAyMi8wOC90aGUtZHJhdy1vZi1tYXJ0aGFzLXZpbmV5YXJkLWZvci1ibGFjay1uZXcteW9yay1wb2xpdGljaWFucy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Draw of Martha's Vineyard for Black New York Politicians,"Oak Bluffs. Photo: Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg via Getty Images

The rising stars of New York‚Äôs Black political Establishment still growing accustomed to their power made the wise decision to put a trip to Martha‚Äôs Vineyard on the agenda this year. For nearly a century the annual summer gathering of Black upper-middle-class artists scholars lawyers doctors and executives has been a hub of cultural events academic panels and informal social bonding. In recent years it‚Äôs also been a good place for politicians to pick up campaign donations.

It‚Äôs a trip that requires some planning: It‚Äôs not always easy to get a ticket on the ferries that service the Vineyard and only a few daily direct flights from New York ‚Äî and almost no available hotel rooms on the island in August (a recent search on Airbnb found weekend stays going for between $979 and $10000 a night).

So it‚Äôs a big deal that Mayor Eric Adams arrived on the island and stayed overnight to attend a fundraiser in Edgartown sponsored by DeNora and Mark Getachew. Attorney General Letitia James Assemblymembers Alicia Hyndman and Latrice Walker and activist Tamika Mallory showed up for quiet meetings. (‚ÄúI listened and learned. I spoke and informed. I gave money and received support. I laughed so much with friends‚Äù Mallory posted on Instagram.)

The private fundraisers and informal meetings are a chance for the state‚Äôs leaders to network without pressure from needy constituents pushy lobbyists and nosy journalists.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to get [Assembly Speaker] Carl Heastie to come here for years. This is his first time‚Äù said Hasoni Pratts a political consultant with a home in Oak Bluffs who co-sponsored a fundraiser for Heastie and separate events for several other candidates. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt like the Latino political conference or the Black Caucus weekend. It‚Äôs a much more relaxed environment ‚Äî not as stuffy and transactional as the usual events.‚Äù

Pratts also hosted Brooklyn‚Äôs own Representative Hakeem Jeffries a leading candidate in the race to become the next Speaker of the House in his first-ever Vineyard fundraiser. Jeffries was in town to headline California congresswoman Barbara Lee‚Äôs 17th Annual Martha‚Äôs Vineyard weekend which included Representative Gregory Meeks of Queens Joyce Beatty of Ohio Jahana Hayes of Connecticut Lisa Rochester of Delaware and Terri Sewell of Alabama.

The fascinating story of how and why generations of Black professionals have flocked to the Vineyard every August is chronicled in Our Kind of People by author-attorney Lawrence Otis Graham who died last year at age 59. Graham a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law was an insightful analyst of race and class; he once took a break from his corporate-law job to work undercover as a busboy at an all-white country club in Greenwich mercilessly exposing its snobbery in a New York cover story.

Oak Bluffs on the north coast of the Vineyard has become a place where Black middle-class overachievers come to relax connect and network free from the tensions glass ceilings and subtle snubs of their mostly white workplaces and neighborhoods back home. This month members of Jack and Jill the invitation-only Black youth organization held mixers for teenagers ‚Äî along with a session on SAT prep. Recruiters from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase were on hand for low-key meet-and-greets with university students many of them from historically Black colleges. And hundreds of members of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority gathered at Inkwell Beach which they turned into the ‚ÄúPinkwell‚Äù for a day.

The 2022 season started with a bang when ex-president Barack Obama and Michelle Obama ‚Äî who own a 29-acre estate in Edgartown ‚Äî made a surprise appearance at the 20th annual Martha‚Äôs Vineyard African-American Film Festival to introduce Descendant a documentary produced by the Obamas‚Äô film company Higher Ground. The festival included Viola Davis broadcaster Tiffany Cross the Reverend Al Sharpton (the subject of a documentary) Tyler Perry and of course Spike Lee who owns a home in Oak Bluffs and has a forthcoming film about NFL ex-quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

In addition to the film festival Spike and Tonya Lewis Lee hosted a sold-out fundraiser for Wes Moore the former CEO of the Robin Hood Foundation who is the Democratic nominee for governor of Maryland.

I ran into my friend Patrick Gaspard the former White House political director for Obama who now runs the Center for American Progress think tank and was part of a panel in Oak Bluffs on Black women in the workplace that included Yamiche Alcindor the host of Washington Week on PBS. Political commentator Bakari Sellers moderated a panel on Black philanthropy; former Bronx assemblyman Michael Blake put together a conference on tech and politics; and the Council of Urban Professionals a civic and corporate networking organization convened its summit.

Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas was in the Vineyard as was Deidre DeJear the Democratic nominee running for governor of Iowa. So was Representative Karen Bass the leading candidate for mayor of Los Angeles. There was buzz around Representative Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Representative Nikema Williams of Georgia both considered young up-and-comers likely to wield significant influence in Congress (Williams doubles as state chair of the Georgia Democratic Party).

‚ÄúThe reason why I open up my network is to help those who don‚Äôt have those connections or resources but they really want to do good ‚Äî they really want to be good public servants and their values are in the right place but they just don‚Äôt have the network‚Äù says Pratts. ‚ÄúRunning for office is hard and a lot of people don‚Äôt have the opportunity to do any type of self-care. But when they come here at least they get a few hours to do self-care even if it‚Äôs just sitting by the pool or going to the beach. So that‚Äôs also part of the donation.‚Äù

Culture conferences teen mixers professional networking personal rejuvenation and a stream of Black money to politicians accumulating dramatic levels of power.

The ground is now called Essity Park.

""After a couple of changes in ownership it just made sense for us to reflect the current name by which the company has become recognised as one of Northumberland's largest and best-known employers"" explained PTFC club chairman Chris Watkins.

""We've been around for a number of years but after the appointment of a new management committee the club has been rejuvenated.

""And thanks to Essity paying us for naming rights we can progress our plans to make this a real community asset - half football half social.""

Essity Park is home to Prudhoe Youth Club Seniors Newcastle University Prudhoe Town Sunday and Prudhoe Town Women's FC.

Prudhoe Plodders also use the track for practice.

Essity site assistant Cath Frost added: ""Prudhoe Mill has been involved in the town's football club since the 1980s and although since then our business has been bought once and changed its name twice we have continued to be proud of our association with the club and its players.

""It's great to have been part of the team for so long - with a plague inside the clubhouse marking those historic links.

""Many of our employees have used the facilities over the years and with the club's new drive to get more social members I think we're going to be together for many more to come.""",,,,,,,,,

These four producers ‚Äî known as the Big Four ‚Äî account for about 84 per cent of Alberta‚Äôs daily production of 3.3 million barrels of bitumen a type of crude oil found in oilsands deposits.

Not only that but it is the oilsands that have driven Alberta‚Äôs economy and finances for the past two decades. According to Alberta‚Äôs 2022 budget oilsands production will make up 87 per cent of the province‚Äôs total oil production as conventional fields empty.

In the face of growing environmental concerns and regulatory requirements some international companies have decided to exit the oilsands. Between 2016 and 2019 foreign oil companies Chevron Shell BP and Statoil sold their oilsands holdings.

But other major Canadian producers like CNRL and Cenovus Energy have doubled down. They see the emission-intensive extraction operation as a golden opportunity to dominate an increasingly single-industry province.

As a political scientist who has worked in a large Alberta-based financial institution and the provincial treasury department I am familiar with the booms and busts of Alberta‚Äôs economy and its correlation to provincial finances. The financial dependence of the Alberta government on bitumen royalties has increased enormously over the past several years.

An industry flush with cash

By comparing the amount of bitumen royalties and corporate income taxes from the Big Four to Alberta‚Äôs total revenue it is possible to estimate the province‚Äôs fiscal dependency on these companies.

The numbers show that no province other than perhaps New Brunswick with its dominant Irving family comes near Alberta‚Äôs level of corporate fiscal dependency.

The revenue expected from the Big Four oilsands producers in 2022 assuming an average per barrel price of $115 will be a staggering $116 billion ‚Äî about 25 per cent of Alberta‚Äôs GDP.

During the first half of 2022 Imperial Oil Cenovus Energy CNRL and Suncor Energy have reported net income of $17.1 billion.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward

What is less understood is what this vast increase in revenue means for the Alberta treasury and to a lesser extent the federal government.

During the first six months of 2022 the Big Four paid an estimated $8 billion in royalties to the Alberta government. Most of their $6.8 billion in income tax expenses went to the federal government with the remaining 30 per cent going to the Alberta government.

Since Alberta has the lowest corporate tax rate in the country this creates an enormous incentive for these companies to create as much taxable income as possible. The taxes and royalties so far this year amount to about $10 billion which would easily pay for Alberta‚Äôs K-12 education system.

Lining the government‚Äôs pockets

The concentration of economic and financial power in the Big Four means Alberta‚Äôs next premier must heed the needs of these massive oilsands players. As oil prices rise the financial dependency of the provincial treasury on the Big Four will grow.

Alberta‚Äôs 2022 budget adopted a very conservative oil price estimate of US$70 per barrel which deliberately understated the expected surplus. It estimated bitumen royalties would return $10.3 billion during the fiscal year.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh

For every dollar above this US$70 per barrel estimate an additional $500 million in oil royalties will flow to the government. At US$100 a barrel an additional $9 billion in bitumen royalties would be paid but with oil prices averaging US$116 since April 1 an additional $23 billion in oil and gas royalties could roll in.

Using this conservative oil price forecast Alberta‚Äôs budget estimated its total revenue will be $52 billion. In reality its revenue will likely be much higher.

The Big Four contribute about 20 per cent of Alberta‚Äôs total revenue. At US$100 per barrel the Big Four contribute about 30 per cent of the province‚Äôs revenue and at US$116 per barrel the contribution exceeds 30 per cent. This gives these companies an enormous amount of control over Alberta‚Äôs finances and by extension politics.

Pathways Alliance

The Big Four‚Äôs political influence has most recently manifested in its dominant position in the Pathways Alliance. This lobbying consortium ‚Äî known as COSIA ‚Äî consists of the Big Four ConocoPhillips and MEG Energy.

According to their website COSIA‚Äôs purpose is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from oilsands production and achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions. The Pathways Alliance sees oilsands production carrying on for nearly three decades and beyond.

Central to this lobby effort has been successfully convincing Ottawa to give the firms a tax credit in the 2022 federal budget. This sets a dangerous precedent ‚Äî if Ottawa itself is willing to grant the wishes of the Big Four what chance will the Alberta premier have in refusing similar requests?

However no Irish dairy processor made the grade.

The 11 European food companies on the list were complimented by two each from China the US and Canada and one from New Zealand India and Japan respectively.

France has two companies in the top three with Lactalis leading the way on a turnover of $26.7bn while Danone was ranked third with a turnover of $21bn. The French duo was split by Nestl√© with the Swiss firm‚Äôs turnover put at $21.3bn.

The top five was completed by Dairy Farmers of America and Chinese company Yilli. These concerns had turnovers of $19.3bn and $18.2bn respectively.

Rest of the top 10

The remainder of the top 10 was made up by Fonterra (New Zealand) Mengniu (China) Friesland-Campina (Netherlands) Arla Foods (Denmark-Sweden) and Saputo (Canada). The turnovers for these dairy processors ranged from $12bn to $14.8bn.

The firms listed from positions 11 to 15 were Unilever (Netherlands-UK) Savencia (France) Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (India) Sodiaal (France) and Meiji (Japan). The turnovers for these dairy concerns went from $5.9bn to $8.3bn.

The final five on the list included Agropur (Canada) Muller (Germany) DMK (Germany) Schreiber Foods (US) and Froneri (UK). The turnovers varied from $5bn to $5.8bn.

Calculations

The turnover calculations were based on 2021 financial results as well as mergers and acquisitions in the first six months of 2022.

The Rabobank survey found that the combined turnover of the companies included in the global dairy top 20 grew by 9.3% in dollar terms compared with last year and by 5% in euro terms.

The top performers in terms of turnover growth compared with the 2021 list were Lactalis and Yilli.

Lactalis which is privately owned grew its turnover by $4bn on the back of the acquisition of Kraft Heinz‚Äôs natural cheese business in the US. This was followed by a raft of acquisitions in Europe and Australia.

Although Chinese firm Yilli remained in fifth place on the list the company grew its turnover by $3bn. This was driven by stronger domestic sales in China and the purchase of IMF-producer Ausnutria.",,,,,,,,,

Barney Kroger did it more than a century ago after spending his life savings of $372 to open a grocery store in 1883 in downtown Cincinnati ‚Äì a single outlet bearing his surname.

While Barney harnessed his horse Dan to a wagon to carry grocery items to customers around Greater Cincinnati the Kroger supermarket mega-chain today is hooking up with specialized technology partners to transport food fresh produce and other household necessities using robotics computer systems algorithms and high-flying drone know-how to do the job even in areas far from the nearest brick-and-mortar Kroger store.

It‚Äôs taken the better part of a decade to pull together a techno-team with the savvy necessary to assemble cyber warehouses (called customer fulfillment centers or CFCs) where humans and robots mingle with a common cause ‚Äì to pack and distribute edibles to hungry folks for miles around.

In addition to more than 2700 walk-in stores Kroger currently operates technology-driven CFCs in Monroe Ohio Groveland Fla. Forest Park Ga. (Atlanta) and Dallas with centers slated for California Frederick Md. Phoenix Romulus Mich. (Detroit) Cleveland Charlotte N.C and New York New Jersey and Connecticut in the Northeast.

With its delivery-only service Kroger is making a return to San Antonio where it closed its 15 stores in the 1900s leaving the Alamo City to H-E-B a major Texas-based grocer.

Kroger taps high-tech to deliver the goods to customers it never reached

In July 2022 The Kroger Co. ‚Äî consideredAmerica‚Äôs largest grocery retailer by revenue ‚Äî opened its newest customer fulfillment center in Dallas. The facility is populated by human beings and automated ‚Äòbots‚Äô working together to fill bins with food ordered via computer and prepare them for shipping by refrigerated trucks to consumers miles away.

Smaller intermediate facilities called ‚Äúspokes‚Äù function as halfway centers to extend delivery mileage.

A news release from Kroger says the 350000 SF customer fulfillment center in Dallas has brought more than 500 new jobs to the Big D and surrounding communities. That massive high-tech center works in conjunction with the smaller ‚Äúspoke‚Äù operations in Austin San Antonio and Oklahoma City. Each ‚Äòspoke‚Äô serves as a ‚Äúlast-mile‚Äù distributor enabling the Kroger delivery trucks to reach more customers.

Kroger has no traditional physical supermarkets in Austin San Antonio or Oklahoma City.

Another region bereft of brick-and-mortar stores bearing a Kroger logo is South Florida a massive population area where a major chunk of Floridians resides in the three largest of the Sunshine State‚Äôs 69 counties ‚Äì Miami-Dade Broward and Palm Beach.

In June 2022 the multi-market giant put out a news release saying: ‚ÄúPropelled by steady growth The Kroger Co. announces Kroger Delivery now serves customers in South Florida with the opening of a new ‚Äòspoke‚Äô location in Miami. The 60000-SF facility in collaboration with the fulfillment center in Groveland [near Orlando] will serve as a last-mile cross-dock location that efficiently expands Kroger Delivery‚Äôs ability to serve more customers.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe 60000-SF high-tech distribution center will bring 200 new jobs to Opa Locka and adjacent communities‚Äù said James Kohnstamm executive vice president of the Miami-Dade Beacon Council.

‚ÄúThis state-of-the-art facility is another example of how two of our key industries ‚Äì trade and planning and technology ‚Äì intersect to deliver innovative seamless solutions that support business growth. The strength of our ecosystem coupled with the infrastructure to support the needs of on-demand grocery delivery make Miami-Dade a natural fit for Kroger‚Äôs expanding ecommerce delivery service.‚Äù

To announce the arrival of its Kroger.com online ordering process the store chain has erected a multitude of billboards particularly along I-95 which snakes through South Florida‚Äôs tri-county area and is advertising heavily on Sunny 107.9 the powerhouse FM music station in West Palm Beach.

The key to Kroger‚Äôs cyber-expansion has virtually everything to do with a high-tech grocery ecommerce platform developed by Ocado based in the U.K.

In 2018 Kroger and Ocado inked a collaboration plan to establish a delivery network that combines artificial intelligence advanced robotics and automation in a bold new way bringing first-of-its-kind technology to America. Through the hub-and-spoke delivery network the organization now serves customers in Central Florida Tampa and Jacksonville ‚Äì a service system that kicked off in 2021 ‚Äî and now in South Florida. It is all done Kroger boasts in its news release ‚Äúwithout traditional brick-and-mortar stores.‚Äù

The delivery network relies on highly automated fulfillment centers. At the hub sites more than 1000 ‚Äúbots‚Äù whizz around giant 3D grids orchestrated by proprietary air-traffic control systems.

The grid known as The Hive contains totes with products and ready-to-deliver customer orders. As customers‚Äô orders near delivery times the bots retrieve products from The Hive and present them at pick stations for items to be sorted for delivery a process governed by algorithms that ensure the items are intelligently packed. For example fragile items are placed on top bags are evenly weighted and each order is optimized to fit into the lowest number of bags reducing plastic use.

After being packed groceries are loaded into refrigerated delivery vans which can store up to 20 orders. Powerful machine learning algorithms optimize delivery routes considering factors like road conditions and optimal fuel efficiency. Drivers may travel up to 90 miles with orders from facilities to make deliveries.

Locals normally offer warm greetings to the arrival of Kroger and its computer-driven purchasing and delivery systems.

‚ÄúKroger‚Äôs choice to establish a new Customer Fulfillment Center in Dallas is a testament to the state‚Äôs exceptional business-climate and highly skilled workforce‚Äù said Texas Governor Greg Abbott. ‚ÄúThis new center is great news for the people of North Texas offering the local community greater access to fresh nutritious foods and bringing good-paying jobs and economic opportunities to hardworking Texans in the area.‚Äù

The company collaborated with the city of Dallas the Governor‚Äôs Office of Economic Development and Tourism local and regional workforce solutions offices and school districts for talent acquisition and development.

Welcoming the Kroger network to South Florida was Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava who said: ‚ÄúKroger‚Äôs new hub in Miami-Dade County is an innovative program that demonstrates how business leaders are leveraging technology to provide important services and job opportunities.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to introduce customers to Kroger Delivery in South Florida‚Äù said Andrea Colby ecommerce corporate affairs and communications manager. ‚ÄúWe offer customers a more convenient option to access fresh food and grocery items. Kroger Delivery is an easy seamless way to order groceries have them arrive in refrigerated vans delivered to your door by professional uniformed associates all based on your demanding schedule.‚Äù

And as consumers demand more efficiency the old ways of getting groceries fade.

In the nine-second clip user Drake Pooley (@drakepooley) reveals the outside of a Kroger as he heads inside. He then records himself entering his old landline number to build its Kroger rewards points.

While Pooley‚Äôs landline is no longer in use the number now presumably belongs to another person. However he‚Äôs not giving up on his family‚Äôs stockpile of rewards points.

‚ÄúTo whoever now has the phone number from my family‚Äôs landline in the mid-2000s sorry but you‚Äôre going to have to pry our KrogerPlus Rewards account from my cold dead hands‚Äù the TikToker says in a voice-over.

Pooley added in the caption ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt work so hard for two decades to just give up now.‚Äù

The video has been viewed over 842000 times since it was posted on Aug. 2. Several viewers similarly shared how they continue to use their own‚Äîor other‚Äôs‚Äîold landline numbers to rack up rewards points.

‚ÄúMy best friend uses my old house phone Kroger account‚Äù one user wrote.

‚Äúi still use my ex‚Äôs parents‚Äô home number. i dated him like 20 yrs ago‚Äù a second said.

‚ÄúYes! My parents haven‚Äôt had their landline in line 10 yrs but we all still use the same Kroger card with that ph# lol‚Äù a third stated.

Many commenters argued that a shared rewards account usually allows all members to reap the benefits.

‚ÄúMy gramma doesn‚Äôt drive I use her fuel points every time! She racks them up!‚Äù one user commented.

Breathitt County dominated on the field as well as the stat sheet on Friday night. The Bobcats rolled up 402-total yards compared to 137 for the visiting Hornets. The Bobcat offensive line took the game over midway through the second quarter and paved the way for 227-rushing yards. The home team jumped out to a 36-0 advantage at halftime. Quarterback Tyler Bryant finished the contest 10/14 for 175-yards. Receiver Blake Ritchie led the way with four receptions for 93-yards.

Magoffin County running back Ben Lafferty led the visitors with 68-yards off 17 carries. He was joined by quarterback Aden Barnett in the Hornet offensive attack. The duo put up the majority of offensive production for the game.

The crowd was cheering and smiling. Given the tragic stories following the July flood that was the best part of the night. The county came together for a high school football game. It was a beautiful site.

Kroger is a staple in your hometown community just like high school football. There‚Äôs nothing quite like Friday nights in the Bluegrass. We are honored to share this journey with Kroger and you for the third consecutive season. We hope you enjoyed this Kroger KSR Game of the Week and look forward to more stops in communities around the Commonwealth.

The U.S. Air Force released new photos of the new EC-37B Compass Call as it briefly visited Davis-Monthan Air Force Base on August 17 2022. The visit gave to the personnel of the 55th Electronic Combat Group the opportunity to see up-close the aircraft that will replace in a few years their ageing EC-130Hs giving in turn better performance and new capabilities over the retiring aircraft. The aircraft which received all external modification is still flying with its primer paint and the civilian registration N591GA.

As you may know already the Compass Call system is an airborne tactical electronic attack weapon system installed on a heavily modified version of the C-130 Hercules called EC-130H Compass Call. This system disrupts enemy command and control communications radars and navigation systems and limits adversary coordination which is essential for enemy force management.

The EC-130H flew for the first time in 1981 and was delivered to the Air Force a year later. The Compass Call is one of the busiest assets of the entire US inventory which took part in every conflict where US troops were engaged in combat and is also longest continuously deployed Air Force asset being deployed since 2002 in Afghanistan. After 40 years however the EC-130H is in need of a replacement with five aircraft out of 14 already retired.

Following the type‚Äôs retirement announced in 2014 the U.S. Air Force initiated the Compass Call Rehost program which will move the current Compass Call systems from the EC-130H to the new EC-37B based on the Gulfstream G550 Conformal Airborne Early Warning Aircraft (CAEW) airframe. As for the EC-130H BAE Systems is the contractor for the Prime Mission Equipment (PME) and L3 Communications is the contractor for aircraft integration and depot maintenance.

The selection of the G550 was the conclusion of a series of assessments that led the Air Force to choose to rehost the existing Compass Call mission system onto a commercial derivative aircraft resulting in a sole-source contract to L3 Communications and Gulfstream in 2017. The G550 has increased speed endurance and extended stand-off range over the legacy EC-130H aircraft says L3Harris providing significantly improved survivability as well as providing improved stand-off jamming capability and flexibility to counter sophisticated communications and radar threats.

Ten EC-37Bs the first three of which are currently being modified in Savannah Georgia and Waco Texas are scheduled to replace the entire EC-130H fleet. It seems however that the order might be increased to 14 aircraft replacing the EC-130H in a 1-to-1 ratio. The first flight of the new EC-37B took place on October 7 2021 while the first ground test of the fully modified aircraft equipped with the Compass Call system are planned for 2023. Air Combat Command plans to field the first five EC-37Bs in 2023.

These first five EC-37B aircraft will host the current Baseline 3 variant of Compass Call which will be ‚Äútransplanted‚Äù from the retired EC-130Hs. The remaining aircraft are scheduled to receive the upgraded Baseline 4 variant currently in development which will reportedly introduce a new low-band jammer system.

One of the technologies that should make it into the Baseline 4 system is the Small Adaptive Bank of Electronic Resources (SABER) technology by BAE Systems which was successfully flight tested for the first time last year. According to the statement from BAE Systems SABER is a major technological advance that will allow the Compass Call weapon system to transition from hardware to software-based electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) warfare capability.

The SABER system is built on a suite of Software Defined Radios (SDRs) using an open system architecture and will provide the backbone of the new EC-37B‚Äôs operating system. This way the Compass Call can be updated without significant physical reconfiguration and enable the U.S. Air Force to rapidly and proactively respond to emerging enemy threat systems.",,,,,,,,,

The new Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) blood test will allow doctors to identify and verify signs of neurodegenerative disease enabling physicians to provide a more effective and efficient path to diagnosis and treatment for patients.

Elevated NfL levels signal neuronal injury whether from diseases like multiple sclerosis Alzheimer's and Parkinson's or from brain injury such as with concussion.

""NfL is a simple objective blood test that provides direct evidence of neuronal damage"" said Dr. Brian Caveney chief medical officer and President Labcorp Diagnostics. ""In making this test widely available Labcorp is supporting neurologists with a tool they've been asking for that enables faster diagnoses better treatment decisions and improved patient care. It's a major step forward in the monitoring and identification of patients with neuronal injury due to disease or trauma.""

Neurological disease presents in many forms and today confirmation of disease is often complex and challenging. When neurons are damaged proteins called neurofilaments are released and are detectable in blood. One of three main neurofilament types NfL has been the most widely studied in research settings but a reliable NfL test has not been widely available for patient care.

Broad availability to physicians as part of their diagnostic toolbox is expected to provide significant benefits in supporting more effective diagnosis and treatment of many disorders.

""Importantly NfL isn't specific to one disease but it is highly specific to neuronal damage from a wide variety of causes from Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis to concussion and physical injury. This test will be impactful in helping many patients"" said Dr. Joseph Volpe neurology business segment and discipline director at Labcorp. ""Serial use of NfL testing can help doctors to follow trends that indicate the effectiveness of medicines or therapies or whether there is continued injury or disease progression.""

The new NfL test is performed from a standard blood collection that can be done at a hospital physician's office or at any of Labcorp's nearly 2000 patient service centers. Launch and availability of the test demonstrates Labcorp's commitment to neurology and to improving the health and lives of the millions afflicted by neurodegenerative and related diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He has also joined a collaborative recollection project called Yat Fo Yan ‚Äì Cantonese for ‚Äúa group of passionate people‚Äù ‚Äì involving designers who recall their creative concepts for several campaigns under his helm including Big Waster the popular mascot used by the Environmental Protection Department to fight food waste.

Wong also gave his backing to a feature film on architecture carbon reduction and global warming and has been meeting environmental groups and students since leaving office.

Apart from Lam and her eight ministers who stepped down seven others held roles in Hong Kong‚Äôs new administration that took office on July 1 including city leader Lee who was the former chief secretary.

Former chief executive Lam has been mostly out of sight since leaving office.

Two sources told the Post she travelled to mainland China from late July to early this month. One said she visited Nanjing with her husband Lam Siu-por for an awards event for their younger son Joshua Lam Yeuk-hay.

Beijing Tsinghua University‚Äôs website showed that he won a gold award for his doctoral dissertation and was among 19 recipients of the International Consortium of Chinese Mathematicians awards with a ceremony held in Nanjing on July 31.

Lam 65 told media before she stepped down that neither of her sons ‚Äì Jeremy Lam Jit-si and Joshua ‚Äì were in Hong Kong.

‚ÄúLam had mentioned a few times that she would spend time in mainland China after stepping down to visit different parts of the country. She is also enjoying her time with family‚Äù one of the sources said.

The former leader‚Äôs whereabouts had drawn interest with rumours in early July that she had gone to London. She dispelled the false talk by attending a seminar at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on July 18.

That was her last public appearance. She deleted her Facebook and Instagram accounts after stepping down. Lam said she would refrain from commenting on government policies and would only consider education work if invited by schools.

The other ministers who stepped down were Law Chi-kwong (labour) Sophia Chan Siu-chee (health) Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah (justice) Edward Yau Tang-wah (commerce) Frank Chan Fan (housing and transport) and Alfred Sit Wing-hang (technology).

Law 68 a former associate professor of social work at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) told the Post he was staying away from new jobs or appointments for now.

‚ÄúMy plan is to have no plan and allow myself to gradually develop a new pattern to my life rhythm‚Äù he said.

But Law said to possess an IQ as high as 160 ‚Äì has not let go of numbers describing his new routine this way: ‚ÄúSwim 1.5km every Monday Wednesday and Friday. Jog 3km and walk another 3km on other days.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúOther time will be on preparing my long-term retirement financial plans playing the guitar [cleaning and clearing] old stuff at home.‚Äù

Former health chief Chan 64 returned to teaching at HKU after a decade of unpaid leave.

A professor of nursing and assistant dean of the faculty of medicine before joining the government in 2012 as an undersecretary she will teach and act as a senior adviser on various university issues.

She told the Post she had no problem adapting to university life again and was ready and excited to return to her research team.

‚ÄúI hope to focus on primary healthcare and impacts on second-hand smoking especially on kids. These are issues that I paid a lot of effort and special attention to and had built foundations for when I was with the administration‚Äù she said.

Her job at the university had to be approved by the government‚Äôs advisory committee on post-office employment to ensure there would be no potential conflict of interest.

Among the others no longer in office and keeping a low profile was former commerce minister Yau a top official since 2007 who made clear how much he was enjoying his new private time.

Responding to Post queries he said: ‚ÄúMy plan is to be spared from media interviews. Take care and all the best.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,

Consumer behavior is incredibly complex and nuanced.

Over the past year we‚Äôve learned that consumer spending can rise even as consumer sentiment plummets amid high inflation and the rising risk of a recession.

One category that‚Äôs seen a particularly high level of inflation is travel with airline fares up 28% from a year ago. Yet one of the strongest areas of consumer spending has been vacation travel which by the way is considered a discretionary expense.

On the matter of discretionary spending Bank of America analysts recently found ‚Äùconsumers do not necessarily dine out less during downturns but rather they tend to shift to cheaper restaurants.‚Äù

That brings us to one of my favorite quotes from the recent earnings season.

It comes from Lamb Weston LW 0.11%‚Üë  the $11 billion potato processor that supplies frozen french fries to your favorite restaurants including McDonald‚Äôs. During the company‚Äôs July 27 quarterly earnings call CEO Tom Werner called attention to the ‚Äúfry attachment rate‚Äù (via The Motley Fool):

Despite pressure on overall restaurant traffic the demand for fries remain solid as the fry attachment rate in the U.S. which is a rate in which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets remains above pre-pandemic levels.

In other words when people go out to eat they‚Äôre not allowing their deteriorating sentiment toward the economy affect their decision to order a side of fries.

Here‚Äôs a little more color from CFO Bernadette Madarieta:

Overall we expect U.S. demand to remain solid but will also likely be affected by significant inflation that consumers are facing. In the event of an economic recession we expect demand for French fries will be resilient although with little to no growth. That's consistent with what we experienced during the great recession from 2008 to 2010.

While the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression might‚Äôve stalled growth it wasn‚Äôt enough to get people to stop ordering fries.

Fascinating stuff.

Passive investing is a concept usually associated with buying and holding a fund that tracks an index. And no passive investment strategy has attracted as much attention as buying an S&P 500 index fund. However the S&P 500 ‚Äî an index of 500 of the largest U.S. companies ‚Äî is anything but a static set of 500 stocks. From January 1995 through April 2022 728 tickers have been added to the S&P 500 while 724 have been removed.

S&P Dow Jones Indices found that funds beat their benchmark in a given year are rarely able to continue outperforming in subsequent years. According to their research 29% of 791 large-cap equity funds beat the S&P 500 in 2019. Of those funds 75% beat the benchmark again in 2020. But only 9.1% or 21 funds were able to extend that outperformance streak into 2021.

Investors should always be mentally prepared for some big sell-offs in the stock market. It‚Äôs part of the deal when you invest in an asset class that is sensitive to the constant flow of good and bad news. Since 1950 the S&P has seen an average annual max drawdown (i.e. the biggest intra-year sell-off) of 14%.

‚ÄúWhile valuations feature importantly in our toolbox to estimate forward equity returns we should dispel an oft-repeated myth that equity valuations are mean-reverting‚Äù Goldman Sachs analysts argued. ‚Äú‚Ä¶there is only 26% confidence that the Shiller CAPE is mean-reverting and 74% confidence that it is not.‚Äù

Media outlets sometimes unfairly characterize a new piece of data as they attempt to draw attention from their audiences. The November 2021 jobs report came with a lot of mainstream news headlines suggesting that the creation of 210000 jobs was a bad thing. Nine months later we‚Äôre learning that the labor market boom continues without interruption.

Picking stocks in an attempt to beat market averages is an incredibly challenging and sometimes money-losing effort. In fact most professional stock pickers aren‚Äôt able to do this on a consistent basis. One of the reasons for this is that most stocks don‚Äôt deliver above-average returns. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices only 22% of the stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index itself from 2000 to 2020. Over that measurement period the S&P 500 gained 322% while the median stock rose by just 63%.

After reporting disappointing quarterly results in February Meta shares plunged 26% in a single trading day. After losing an eye-popping $251 billion of market cap the social networking company quickly went from being the sixth largest company in the S&P 500 to the seventh. It‚Äôs the kind of move that could‚Äôve rattled the confidence of investors and traders with positions in other stocks. And it did: That same day the S&P 500 fell 2.4%. But losing 2.4% isn‚Äôt remotely close to losing 26%. That‚Äôs diversification at work.

Published on Dec. 5 this newsletter showed Wall Street strategists were anticipating the S&P 500 to end 2022 somewhere between 4400 to 5300. The market is currently trading below the most bearish strategist‚Äôs target. Who knows? Maybe the market will surge during the final months of this year. That said I think this excerpt from that newsletter was noteworthy:

‚ö†Ô∏è It‚Äôs incredibly difficult to predict with any accuracy where the stock market will be in a year. In addition to the countless number of variables to consider there are also the totally unpredictable developments that occur along the way.Strategists will often revise their targets as new information comes in. In fact some of the numbers you see above represent revisions from prior forecasts.For most of y‚Äôall it‚Äôs probably ill-advised to overhaul your entire investment strategy based on a one-year stock market forecast.Nevertheless it can be fun to follow these targets. It helps you get a sense of the various Wall Street firm‚Äôs level of bullishness or bearishness.

Five stocks (Facebook Apple Amazon Microsoft and Google) account for a massive share of the market capitalization of the S&P 500 which consists of 500 companies. While it may be technically accurate to say these five stocks represent five companies it‚Äôs also a gross oversimplification of the businesses and markets these companies are exposed to.

Peter Lynch the legendary stock picker who ran Fidelity‚Äôs market-beating Magellan Fund for 13 years made a prescient observation in a speech he gave to the National Press Club back in October 7 1994: ‚ÄúSome event will come out of left field and the market will go down or the market will go up. Volatility will occur. Markets will continue to have these ups and downs. ‚Ä¶ Basic corporate profits have grown about 8% a year historically. So corporate profits double about every nine years. The stock market ought to double about every nine years ‚Ä¶ Because profits go up 8% a year and stocks will follow. That's all there is to it.‚Äú

The stock market can be an intimidating place: it‚Äôs real money on the line there‚Äôs an overwhelming amount of information and people have lost fortunes in it very quickly. But it‚Äôs also a place where thoughtful investors have long accumulated a lot of wealth. The primary difference between those two outlooks is related to misconceptions about the stock market that can lead people to make poor investment decisions.

Sign up now to receive EE Times Weekend. SUBSCRIBE The Sky‚Äôs the Limit Christine Evans-Pughe The first time I went to Las Vegas nearly 20 years ago I was baffled and bowled over in equal measure. Why were elderly people wheeling drip stands around? Why couldn‚Äôt I find an everyday bookshop? What genius had painted the ceiling of the Venetian hotel? Surely this was the most fabulous example of trompe l‚Äôoeil indoor sky ever ‚Äî certainly in terms of sheer scale. Installed above the Venetian‚Äôs indoor canals street scenes and remodeled St. Mark‚Äôs Square the 105000-square-foot (that‚Äôs about 35 full-sized tennis courts) trompe l‚Äôoeil blue-sky ceiling is both beautiful and a bit bonkers. Imagine Canaletto meets Michelangelo with a nod to Edward Hopper. For me the Renaissance-style realism and artificial daylight brought on a dream-like discombobulated state as though trapped inside a movie. For some historical perspective Michelangelo and his assistants started painting the 12000 square feet of ceiling and walls (four full-sized tennis courts) of the Sistine Chapel in Rome in 1508. They didn‚Äôt finish it until 1512. That‚Äôs a long time to spend perched on 60-foot‚Äìhigh scaffolding applying paint to wet plaster. They had trickier things to paint than sky (nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which The Creation of Adam is the best known). In contrast it took just two years to build the entire Venetian hotel before it opened in May 1999 with the help of a flock of white doves and some singing gondoliers. A company called Sky Art created the trompe l‚Äôoeil ceiling in 1998 with a little help from technology. Sky Art‚Äôs painters worked from aerial boom lifts from which they applied 250 gallons of water-based acrylic paint with spray guns. Sky Art CEO and former Hollywood scenery artist Karen Kristin stood at ground level and used a laser pointer to direct her team of assistants. Las Vegas hotels are in many ways ephemera with a limited shelf life. The Venetian was built on the site of the famous Sands Hotel where Frank Sinatra made his performing debut in 1953. The Sands met its end in 1996. According to a report in the Las Vegas Sun ‚ÄúAfter a countdown from 10 there were seven dynamite blasts and the 44-year‚Äìold 17-story tower collapsed into a 30-foot‚Äìhigh pile of rubble. The whole thing took 10 seconds.‚Äù Many people watched the hotel‚Äôs demise including a group of University of Las Vegas film students who videotaped it for a school project. ‚ÄúIt was cool‚Äù one of them said. ‚ÄúAnything blowing up is cool.‚Äù It was the second demolition of a Las Vegas hotel-casino that the group had filmed. The first was the Dunes hotel-casino demolished in 1994 and they‚Äôd hoped to capture the Landmark in 1995 but missed it. This is how Las Vegas hotels meet their end. It would be sad to see The Venetian and its splendid ceiling go the same way. Let‚Äôs hope it has at least 20 more years to go. EE Times Words to the Wise EE Times has compiled the best of Weekend Edition‚Äôs CEO interviews in our new eBook Words to the Wise. You‚Äôll find advice and inspiration from top semiconductor industry leaders in this curated collection of our most interesting and most illuminating interviews. Free Download A Glistening Jewel Alan Patterson Las Vegas. When the desert sand turns a deep purple in the twilight you become a glistening gem in the darkness. You are a neon oasis where people go for a brief time to have fun roll the dice and be naughty. You fulfill the urge of electronics journalists to write stories. You are a place where great fortunes are made and lost though generally not on the gambling table. One notable example is Sheldon Adelson who at his peak had a net worth of about $33 billion and became one of the world‚Äôs richest people. In the late 1970s Adelson and his partners launched the COMDEX (pardon the screaming ALL CAPS) trade show in Las Vegas for the computer industry one of the largest-such events in the world for decades. It was a gamble that paid off in spades for Adelson before he bailed out. In 1995 Adelson and his partners sold the Interface Group Show Division including COMDEX to Japan‚Äôs SoftBank for $862 million. It was a bet that Softbank founder Masayoshi Son probably regrets. Adelson made more than $500 million from the deal. Adelson had this knack for leaping from strength to strength. In the late 1980s he bought the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas for $110 million. From there he and his partners built the Sands Expo and Convention Center the first privately owned-and-operated convention center in the U.S. In the meantime COMDEX became a global event opening its doors to the general public and becoming a bit of a zoo. The first show outside the U.S. took place in Amsterdam in 1982. By 2000 annual exhibitions spread around the world to Europe Asia Africa and Australia. By 2004 as the personal computer waned in popularity the last COMDEX in Las Vegas was canceled and the Consumer Electronics Show rose to the occasion meeting new demand for a show that focused on increasingly popular gadgets like games and smartphones. In the same year Adelson took Las Vegas Sands casinos to Macau which would eventually eclipse Las Vegas as the world‚Äôs gambling mecca. Following the opening in Macau Adelson‚Äôs personal wealth multiplied more than 14√ó. Today the twinkle is returning to Las Vegas. Covid lockdowns in China have led to a plunge in Macau‚Äôs business. It all goes to show that fortunes change. My advice is not to gamble. The house always wins. Las Vegas you‚Äôve had a good run. Beneath the Surface Sally Ward-Foxton Buckle up for your ride approximately 40 feet below the Las Vegas Strip in a futuristic battery-powered vehicle through purpose-built 13-foot tunnels. Like some other Las Vegas attractions the Boring Company‚Äôs LVCC Loop must be seen to be believed. The tunnel is even illuminated with color-changing disco lighting as you pass through. But scratch beneath the surface and you‚Äôll realize the 1.7-mile ride is effectively just a taxi ride Vegas style. The LVCC Loop can handle 44000 passengers per hour and has three stops (two surface one subsurface) where drivers can drop off in specially built stations. It uses a fleet of 62 Tesla Model X and Model 3 electric vehicles with human drivers ‚Äî just like a regular fleet of taxis using road tunnels except there are only three possible destinations. Consider it a proof of concept for a future Vegas-wide underground transit system ‚Äî specifically a more ambitious 51-station tunnel system planned for the coming years. The plan includes a 29-mile loop with stops at Las Vegas‚Äôs airport stadium and university as well as many resorts. According to the Boring Company Tesla taxis in this system will drive straight to dropoff points making it much faster than a traditional underground train which would stop at every calling point along the way. Stations can be built as small as two parking spaces and it‚Äôs planned for Teslas in this system to drive at up to 150 mph (don‚Äôt get excited just yet ‚Äî taxis in the current LVCC Loop run at much more terrestrial speeds). The real technology breakthrough here is the Boring Company‚Äôs drilling machine which dug the existing LVCC Loop in a year. Boring‚Äôs next-gen machines are 6√ó faster currently capable of a mile of tunnel a week. They are launched from the surface so no need to dig a huge pit to start with and they emerge mole-like into the surface sunshine at the other end ready for a station to be built next to the hole. The company hopes these machines will make tunnel construction economical and scalable for future transit systems. Without a Trace Sally Ward-Foxton Kaboom! As the Riviera one of Las Vegas‚Äôs oldest casinos is demolished ‚Äî removed from the desert city without a trace. Or is it? The Riviera‚Äôs iconic red neon sign featured in a multitude of movies over the years has been taken to the Las Vegas Neon Museum and installed in the museum‚Äôs boneyard ‚Äî a graveyard of vintage old and abandoned neon signage the majority in iconic mid-century design ‚Äî as a tribute to Las Vegas‚Äôs history. Signs from forgotten casino complexes rest alongside signs from motels dry cleaners and wedding chapels. Neon signs first appeared in the 1920s but by the 1950s casino owners wanted to outdo each other with bigger brighter signs. The spirit of always going one bigger and one better lives on with casinos on prime real estate turned over relatively quickly. Old casino signs from properties like the Silver Slipper and Golden Nugget have been preserved by the Neon Museum to prevent every trace of these parts of Las Vegas‚Äôs culture being consigned to history completely. Famous animated cowboy Vegas Vic (constructed in 1951) can still be seen waving atop a Vegas souvenir shop. Cowgirl Vegas Vickie (1980) was removed in 2017 when her casino was demolished ‚Äî she was restored being reinstalled at the Circa in 2020. Over the years some signs didn‚Äôt make it ‚Äî the Mint the Dunes the Sands and more. But the Neon Museum has hundreds in its boneyard with 19 (including the Riviera‚Äôs) currently in working order. More are planned for restoration. In the meantime the boneyard is a riot of color even without illumination. One tip: Don‚Äôt go on a summer afternoon. The boneyard is outdoors.

But the signal chain of a medium-quality system can be daunting including the vast variety of source material especially now with uncompressed streaming services DACs cabling amplifiers line conditioners room damping and of course speakers. It can all be very time-consuming and certainly expensive but the payoff is spine-tingling sound. What was your first job in the industry? My first job in the industry was designing graphics ICs for the U.S. Air Force. I worked for a company called Lytton Systems and it was an amazing job. Basically we were to produce the highest-performance graphics devices possible. This was pre-ATI/Nvidia days so there was still an opportunity to add significant value in this space. What made the job even more incredible was that it provided broad exposure to several technical concepts not the least of which was semiconductor IC design. But there were so many other important concepts involved such as high-speed memory architectures parallel processing multiply-accumulate functions for polygon processing assembly code optimization for algorithm optimization and so on. We used to go to the annual Siggraph conferences so we really witnessed the dawning of the 3D rendering age. I eventually moved to a more commercial role but as I mentioned above having solid technical experience in my opinion is a very important cornerstone in one‚Äôs career. What book do you read over and over again? My favorite book is ‚ÄúThe Making of the Atomic Bomb‚Äù by Richard Rhodes. It a deeply comprehensive account of atomic physics from about the turn of the 20th century to the massive effort by the U.S. government to develop an atom bomb with the launch of Project Manhattan. The book is pretty technical but also explores the associated politics of the day as well as significant operational effort by the U.S. government to make it happen. It‚Äôs really fascinating! Of course those early atomic efforts led to the development of the transistor as well so that has a particular resonance for me as the CEO of a semiconductor company. What has been the highlight of your career to date? I‚Äôve had many highlights but the most recent one was the completion of our RTO with MoSys last December and joining NASDAQ. After 14 years as a private company being public is a whole new experience. The liquidity of being a public company brings a host of benefits including employee recruitment and retention credibility with a larger customer base and access to capital if necessary. Obviously there‚Äôs the grind of the quarter-to-quarter earnings calls but frankly this brings a level of discipline to management that I believe is healthy. There is a prevailing concept that quarter-to-quarter objectives destroy long-term thinking but I don‚Äôt necessarily agree; I don‚Äôt believe these two concepts are mutually exclusive. In fact while our quarterly earnings are vital our investors demand a long-term vision for growth especially in the small and microcap world in which we reside today. What advice would you give to early-career engineers? The first piece of advice I would give is to make sure you spend two to four years refining your skills as a technologist. In my case I spent the first four years of my career designing graphic ICs. I learned so much about designing computer chips and it is still applicable in my current role as the CEO of a semiconductor company. I personally chose to pivot to a more commercial role but it‚Äôs clear to me that moving to a commercial track and sticking with a technical track are equally rewarding. I think each person needs to determine their own long-term goals and interests.

Johnny Friday and Rob Mader are musicians. They are not doctors. But Mader a sax virtuoso told Friday a few weeks ago ‚ÄúMusic saved your life.‚Äù

Friday‚Äôs doctor told him the same thing.

‚ÄúMusic saved my life. How about that?‚Äù Friday says. ‚ÄúThey were right.‚Äù

Friday is the thunderous drummer and horsepower behind Santa Fe & The Fat City Horns. He originally joined the band about 30 years ago then took off to perform around the world. He returned to full-time duty with the acclaimed 16-piece band about six years ago.

Well-known and highly regarded on the Las Vegas music scene the 60-year-old musician has been a coveted touring musician backing Natalie Cole Arturo Sandoval and Chick Corea among many international artists. Friday also lived in L.A. for about 25 years and performed in the house band for the Emmy Awards show People‚Äôs Choice Awards ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Chevy Chase Show‚Äù and Bonnie Hunt‚Äôs daytime talk show. He‚Äôs the drummer for the music in Clint Eastwood‚Äôs movies ‚ÄúThe Mule‚Äù and ‚ÄúJewel‚Äù and several TV commercials.

Even with that impressive resume Friday stays in the background. He‚Äôs noticed only when you hear his slamming beat akin to a pack of M-80s exploding onstage. But Friday‚Äôs consistency belied what doctors call a serious medical ‚Äúepisode‚Äù the night of June 13.

Friday had just returned from tour swing with Filipino star and Vegas favorite Martin Nievera scrambling to the show in the same clothes he‚Äôd worn on the plane because his luggage had been lost.

Typical night in showbiz in other words.

About four songs into the opening set Friday says ‚ÄúAll of a sudden I felt like an elephant was standing on my chest.‚Äù

That seems the default description for anyone suffering a serious heart attack especially drummers. Pepe Jimenez used it when he suffered a similar onstage incident last year while rehearsing with David Perrico and the Raiders House Band at Allegiant Stadium. In a wild artistic and medical coincidence Jimenez was Santa Fe‚Äôs drummer until Friday returned to the band in full-time in 2017.

Friday knew something was wrong as he struggled to breathe while front man Jerry Lopez spoke to the crowd after the opening songs. ‚ÄúI literally was (makes heavy wheezing sound) trying to catch some air. But Jerry talked long enough for me to calm myself down‚Äù Friday says. ‚ÄúAnd I was drinking a bunch of water pacing myself playing 100 percent instead of 1000 percent.‚Äù

Friday had finished playing the band‚Äôs Earth Wind & Fire medley followed by the Santa Fe originals ‚ÄúThe Answer‚Äù and ‚ÄúDat Greazy Thang‚Äù a challenging stretch for even a healthy drummer.

Friday finished the show then packed his equipment and drove himself to Henderson Hospital‚Äôs emergency room. In another piece of unfortunate timing Friday‚Äôs wife Mary was on a cruise with a girlfriend she‚Äôd planned in 2019 and had been postponed three times because of COVID-19. She was in fact trapped on a ship at sea.

But it was Mary‚Äôs health insurance through Grainger commercial and industrial equipment supply company that has almost totally offset the couple‚Äôs $250000 (and climbing) medical bills.

‚ÄúLater afterward when everyone learned what happened they thought I was crazy for finishing the gig‚Äù Friday says. ‚ÄúBut the doctor told me ‚ÄòYou saved your own life.‚Äô And I‚Äôm like ‚ÄòDoc what are you talking about?‚Äô‚Äù

The drummer‚Äôs characteristically aerobic playing style kept the beat for the band and for Friday.

‚ÄúSo the doctor goes ‚ÄòThe type of heart attack you had most people are sitting on the couch watching TV‚Äô and if I had been doing that I would have been a done deal‚Äù Friday says. ‚ÄúThe fact that I was exerting myself keeping my heart pumping kept the blood flowing and actually saved my life.‚Äù

Friday‚Äôs test results were at once disquieting and predictable for anyone who had this elephant-chest sensation. He would undergo open-heart quadruple-bypass surgery on June 16 three days after the show. He spent about two weeks in the hospital and several more in physical therapy gradually working his way back to the stage.

Friday‚Äôs first performance back for any show was the Aug. 6 Daniel Emmet-Pia Toscano performance at Westgate‚Äôs International Theater (the night David Foster popped into the show unbilled).

Friday then returned to Santa Fe‚Äôs show at the Copa Room at Bootlegger Bistro last Monday about two months to the day of the surgery.

‚ÄúI kind of worked up my stamina up to play with Santa Fe‚Äù Friday says. ‚ÄúIf I had tried to go from my couch directly to Santa Fe I would be back in the hospital.‚Äù

Friday and Jimenez bonded over their shared medical conditions.

‚ÄúPepe called me afterwards and gave me a heads up how you ‚Äî how I‚Äôm ‚Äî gonna feel how the physical therapy is going to go and this and that‚Äù Friday says. ‚ÄúSo I tease him now because he only had a triple bypass. I tell him ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not a man until you have a quadruple bypass!‚Äô But you know he‚Äôs been such a sweetheart through all of this and we have that shared history in Santa Fe.‚Äù

The message from Jimenez and now Friday is to simply pay attention to your health. Visit the doctor. Take medical advice and directives seriously. Friday has never experienced high blood pressure he doesn‚Äôt drink or smoke. He doesn‚Äôt even eat red meat.

‚ÄúWhen something like this happens it puts a fine point on it‚Äù Friday says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine I‚Äôm getting better every day. It‚Äôs a slow process you can‚Äôt rush it. But I‚Äôll tell you I‚Äôm listening to my body and I‚Äôm taking nothing for granted.‚Äù

Todas las columnas de opini√≥n de personas ajenas a la Redacci√≥n de EL PA√çS llevar√°n tras la √∫ltima l√≠nea un pie de autor ‚Äîpor conocido que √©ste sea‚Äî donde se indique el cargo t√≠tulo militancia pol√≠tica (en su caso) u ocupaci√≥n principal o la que est√© o estuvo relacionada con el tema abordado

Remember. Nos conocimos en Monterrey y lo primero que me ense√±aste es la correcta pronunciaci√≥n de tu nombre: Salm√°n (con acento en la segunda vocal) y R√∫shdi (acentuando el sonido de la √∫ a contrapelo de los espa√±oles que te llaman R√°shdi crey√©ndose brit√°nicos o los mexicanos que subrayan el R√≥sh como sin√≥nimo gringo de avalancha o prisa). Salman Rushdie conocido por millones le√≠do por no tantos incluido el fan√°tico que te apu√±al√≥ hace apenas una semana; es decir hace un instante.

Al paso de las horas desde el atentado aumenta la enigm√°tica iron√≠a de que el asaltante ‚Äìahora preso‚Äîlleva en el apellido su sino. Se llama Matar y para su mayor desgracia ni eso logr√≥; tal como se cumple un a√±o m√°s desde el asesinato del poeta Garc√≠a Lorca en Granada y los verdugos que tienen las calaveras rellenas de plomo queriendo matarlo tan s√≥lo lograron quitarle la vida para volverlo inmortal. Retru√©canos de la iron√≠a enigma del tiempo y del desconocido guionista celestial que redacta que el nombre de verdugo se llame Matar o que Osama muri√≥ en tiempos de Obama y dem√°s sincronicidades o rimas inexplicables.

Remember que me evocaste con sana nostalgia un paseo por La Alhambra de Granada del brazo de Antonio Mu√±oz Molina y que ambos aparecen en una fotograf√≠a que sirvi√≥ de dominical de El Pa√≠s donde se les ve rodeados de 12 o 14 transe√∫ntes turistas o comparsas an√≥nimos cuyas caras quedaron diluidas porque se trataban de escoltas inc√≥gnitos. S√≥lo caras desenfocadas en torno a dos rostros de escritores y el √∫ltimo suspiro del Moro se volv√≠a tinta en papel sin que ustedes mismos supieran qui√©nes eran los arc√°ngeles armados que los custodiaban por los azulejos de un palacio so√±ado decorado con versos del Cor√°n‚Ä¶ y el agua oculta que llora de sus fuentes.

Como parpadeo pasaron las d√©cadas al grado de hacernos pensar que Salman ya pod√≠a andar sin escudos por el mundo y en Monterrey as√≠ como hace una semana apenas hubo vigilancia cuando subimos a un escenario. Tras bambalinas tambi√©n evocaste un viaje en tren surrealista con Juan Villoro hacia un pueblo llamado Tequila como Comala espejismo borroso y mareado de un puro paisaje de p√°rrafos y all√≠ mismo en el camerino de Monterrey despu√©s del escenario te cont√© de mi amigo Philippe y la insomne madrugada que se alarg√≥ en raros instantes luego de que hab√≠as inaugurado al lado de √Ålvaro Mutis y Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas la Casa Refugio Citlalt√©petl en una colonia Condesa ultravigilada en una parte acordonada de la ciudad m√°s grande del mundo donde apenas cortaste el list√≥n te sacaron en helic√≥ptero con rumbo a una playa invisible porque hab√≠a rumores de un comando fan√°tico que pretend√≠a aplicarte la fetwa del anciano profeta de Ir√°n.

Pero no sab√≠as que al comando le cay√≥ encima la fetwa de Moctezuma en forma de una diarrea galopante y tripartita por obra y gracia de los taquitos de suadero que se echaron los muj√°idines la noche anterior a su fracasado operativo y remember que te cont√© que a mi Philippe lo despert√≥ la Polic√≠a Judicial durante la madrugada en que ya dorm√≠as en esa playa invisible para informarle inquirir e insinuar en torno al incre√≠ble descubrimiento de unas cajas con dinamita que se hallaron bajo la escalinata de la casona ahora de Refugio para Escritores y que todo se deb√≠a al raro azar de que el inmueble hab√≠a pertenecido a un ingeniero en minas que todo ello nada ten√≠a que ver con el list√≥n que hab√≠as cortado el d√≠a anterior y que se supone que esos mismos judiciales hab√≠an revisado cada mil√≠metro de la casona al tiempo que acordonaban una porci√≥n considerable de la Ciudad de M√©xico.

Re√≠mos. Re√≠amos en Monterrey la hermosa vida los amigos que nos unen los libros que compartimos en dos idiomas‚Ä¶ y el tiempo que no es m√°s que un instante. Pero re√≠mos tambi√©n porque para presentarte ante el publico de la Universidad Aut√≥noma de Nuevo Le√≥n optamos por el sendero del humor que destila tu persona y casi todos tus libros. Quien te lea y conozca Salm√°n se llevar√° la agradable sorpresa de la prosa alegre el jard√≠n feliz de la memoria la ligereza del sarcasmo inteligente tan alejado del pastelazo y el chistorete‚Ä¶ pero para eso hay que leerte y m√°s ahora que se confirma que quienes te odian y atacan s√≥lo han le√≠do una o dos p√°ginas de uno solo de tus libros y a√∫n as√≠ se abrogan irracionalmente el empe√±o de Matar.

Matar es lo que hace la ignorancia y el necio empecinamiento de la estulticia; matar es derramar la sangre a contrapelo de intentar el entendimiento incluso de lo incomprensible y matar es el pan de cada d√≠a desde que ‚Äìsin leerte‚Äîte condenaba a muerte la locura y Matar es ahora el diablo tras las rejas al que hab√≠a que condenar a leerte a ser le√≠do en cada tramo de los horarios de su condena que ha de durar todo el tiempo y apenas un el√©ctrico instante en que alg√∫n polic√≠a le inform√≥ que no hab√≠a logrado quitarte la vida.

Remember que te confi√© de una joven pareja de reci√©n casados que intentaron volar de Madrid a M√©xico el mismo d√≠a en que los ayatol√°s amenazaron dinamitar los aviones de Iberia porque los editores unidos de Espa√±a acababan de publicar Los versos sat√°nicos. Otra l√≠nea otro avi√≥n de diferente bandera sustituy√≥ el vuelo de esos reci√©n casados para Holanda y all√≠ detuvieron al novio por verlo sospechoso y porque cargaba un Walkman como el que usaron los terroristas del avi√≥n PanAm sobre Lockerbie‚Ä¶ y nos re√≠mos en Monterrey del novio revisado como delincuente porque le√≠a Los versos sat√°nicos que afortunadamente pudo terminar de leer antes de aterrizar en la Ciudad de M√©xico absuelto de sospechas holandesas y herido apenas por una neuralgia del trig√©mino que lo tentaba a tirarse de cabeza desde el avi√≥n de KLM sobre el Atl√°ntico como pati√±o inc√≥modo que acompa√±ara a los dos personajes de esa novela sobre sat√°nicos versos que se vuelven arc√°ngeles al caer al vac√≠o desde un avi√≥n dinamitado por terroristas de verdad aunque esfumados en la generosa ficci√≥n que transpira la tinta de tu pluma.

Re√≠mos a dos voces de una tarde que se volvi√≥ noche en que Paul Auster me confundi√≥ creyendo que yo era gringo alrededor de las calles del C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes de Madrid y lloramos ambos ‚Äìsin l√°grimas‚Äîlas tres d√©cadas en que se fueron evaporando amores y s√≠ una sola l√°grima compartida y apenas visible frente al p√∫blico en Monterrey porque tuvo que pasar todo ese tiempo ese √∫nico y mismo instante para finalmente abrazarte con la gratitud de quien por leerte se convert√≠a en aliado y c√≥mplice.

Re√≠mos recordando la voz de Octavio Paz y la camarader√≠a de Carlos Fuentes en un Londres que recorr√≠as a escondidas de refugio en escondite de librer√≠as disfrazado y siempre de amoroso padre de tu hijo. Remember que eres rostro casi siempre sonriente ya por el humor de tu inmensa inteligencia y desatada imaginaci√≥n o porque los ojos al medio filo de tus p√°rpados parecen iniciar la sonrisa as√≠ te quedes con uno solo de tus ojos para mirar al mundo con palabras y cuajar el instante en que el novio de hace treinta a√±os te pudiera abrazar en Monterrey y llorar juntos la eternidad del azar la novia que se esfuma como espuma de mar en la memoria el mismo ejemplar comprado hace tres d√©cadas que firmaste en Monterrey y el mismo instante en que ayer Paul Auster y tantos escritores amigos se arremolinaban en la escalinata que lleva hacia las columnas de un tiempo inasible para celebrar tu vida voz y vocaci√≥n‚Ä¶ porque remember que todos tenemos el invaluable tesoro de hablar opinar pensar y plasmar en libertad que toda voz que se eleva con honestidad por encima de la necedad y todos los p√°rrafos que se imprimen por encima del veneno autoritario navegan sobre nubes sin saber si han de ser le√≠dos confiados en que alguien asegura con su mirada el ciclo ida y vuelta donde el lector remata el silencio de las s√≠labas que apenas pudiste murmurar al salir de la anestesia‚Ä¶ porque eso no se puede matar.

Compartimos fotograf√≠as frases inspiradoras art√≠culos que son de nuestro inter√©s videos memes y un sinf√≠n de informaci√≥n que nos parece relevante. Al compartir art√≠culos de cualquier tema las personas lo hacen porque los han le√≠do y les han interesado. Sin embargo un estudio nuevo indica que no todos se detienen a leer lo que publican pero creen que tienen el conocimiento del tema por tan solo compartirlo en sus redes.

Los investigadores Adrian Ward Frank Zheng y Susan Broniarczyk de la Universidad de Texas iniciaron un estudio que public√≥ el Journal of Consumer Psychology y muestra conclusiones interesantes.

El primer experimento que realizaron los expertos fue meramente para observar. Pidieron a los participantes elegir varios art√≠culos de su inter√©s pero no ten√≠an que leerlos. Sin embargo ten√≠an la opci√≥n de compartirlos con los siguientes participantes del estudio. Alrededor de 40% de las veces que los primeros participantes compartieron un art√≠culo fue despu√©s de haberlo le√≠do completamente; 20% de las veces que se comparti√≥ un art√≠culo fue le√≠do parcialmente; y 40% restante de las veces que se compartieron los art√≠culos con los siguientes participantes no fueron le√≠dos por los primeros.

La investigaci√≥n no termin√≥ ah√≠: los voluntarios completaron ex√°menes peque√±os sobre los art√≠culos (conocimiento objetivo) y midieron en una escala cu√°nto cre√≠an que sab√≠an del tema del art√≠culo (conocimiento subjetivo). El conocimiento subjetivo (su creencia sobre cu√°nto sab√≠an) increment√≥ con la evaluaci√≥n del conocimiento objetivo y curiosamente la escala de su conocimiento subjetivo tambi√©n increment√≥ simplemente por el hecho de compartir el art√≠culo sin importar si lo hab√≠an le√≠do o no.

Creencias propias

En un segundo estudio los participantes midieron en una escala su conocimiento sobre una variedad de temas incluyendo la prevenci√≥n del c√°ncer. Dos semanas despu√©s regresaron a otro experimento y leyeron un art√≠culo sobre prevenci√≥n de c√°ncer y otro sobre prevenci√≥n de robo de identidad. Despu√©s de leer el art√≠culo asignado los participantes pod√≠an compartir el art√≠culo sobre la prevenci√≥n del c√°ncer en sus redes sociales o simplemente pod√≠an elegir revisar posibles publicaciones sin compartirlas. A continuaci√≥n calificaron sus conocimientos subjetivos (lo que creen que saben) de una serie de temas incluyendo la prevenci√≥n del c√°ncer.

Al igual que los resultados del primer estudio la creencia subjetiva de las personas sobre su conocimiento de la prevenci√≥n del c√°ncer aument√≥ cuando compartieron la publicaci√≥n en sus redes sociales sin importar si hab√≠an le√≠do el art√≠culo o no.

En otros experimentos se replic√≥ este ejercicio y los resultados fueron los mismos: un aumento en la creencia subjetiva pero solamente al compartir art√≠culos con personas que cre√≠an que ver√≠an de nuevo. Compartir art√≠culos con extra√±os no provocaba cambios en sus propias creencias sobre su conocimiento.

Creo que este tipo de comportamiento nos puede pasar a todos. Quiz√° leemos un encabezado y un primer p√°rrafo y creemos que comprendemos toda la informaci√≥n. Sin embargo pienso que antes de compartir algo hay que tratar de entenderlo. Y t√∫ ¬øcompartes cosas sin leerlas?

In the last year we‚Äôve heard reports about the Astroworld tragedy the backstage killing of Drakeo the Ruler and an onstage attack on Dave Chappelle. What all of these events have in common besides being tragic and unsettling is the involvement of concert promoter Live Nation. And taken together they raise a significant question: is there more the company could be doing to prevent future tragedies?



In a new investigation for the Los Angeles Times August Brown took a deeper look into Live Nation‚Äôs security practices and found a few unsettling gaps. The investigation included conversations with experts in the field and a review of lawsuits pertaining to Live Nation events; the picture it paints offers a glimpse into how a massive company focused on event promotion can get some essential components of event security wrong.



Among the people Brown spoke with was a security guard who argued that Live Nation had understaffed several events they had worked on which led to ‚Äúchaotic‚Äù atmospheres when the existing security personnel were unable to provide crowd control during tense situations.



A spokesperson for Live Nation disputed the idea that disparate incidents reflected anything greater. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs misleading to say there is a pattern of issues when the nature of the incidents at those events was fundamentally different‚Äù they told the Times.



A recent report from The Guardian noted that in the wake of Astroworld last year a number of musicians are taking it upon themselves to respond to tense situations at concerts. And while that‚Äôs admirable there‚Äôs also a scale beyond which that doesn‚Äôt seem feasible.



Whether or not the Times investigation ‚Äî or say Congress‚Äôs investigation of Astroworld ‚Äî will result in tangible changes is as yet unclear. But they may well leave concertgoers with a few more things on their mind the next time they go to see live music.

Philadelphia is about to get not one but three new independent music venues.

Avram Hornik the nightlife impresario and restaurateur is back in the live music business.

Hornik‚Äôs company FCM Hospitality‚Äôs ventures include Harper‚Äôs Garden in Center City Lola‚Äôs Garden in Ardmore and Morgan‚Äôs Pier and Liberty Point on the Delaware River the latter of which is Philadelphia‚Äôs largest outdoor restaurant.

When music venues Union Transfer and Boot & Saddle opened in 2011 and 2013 Hornik was part owner though he later sold his interest in both. (Boot & Saddle closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 shutdown.)

Now Hornik is reentering the live music space with venues in Center City South Philly and Fishtown.

The 500-capacity Concourse Live will begin presenting indie bands at its Market Street address next month. The 200-capacity dance club the Dolphin Tavern on South Broad Street has already added a steady stream of live acts to the DJ calendar. And a third venue on North Delaware Avenue that will hold 700 is targeting an early-2023 opening.

All will be produced by Philly Independent Productions the new concert division of FCM.

Local and national bands are being booked by Marley McNamara the Philly music scene veteran who‚Äôs an alum of Fishtown club Johnny Brenda‚Äôs and former manager of acts like Lititz Pa. quartet The Districts.

The small- to medium-sized venue live music business is highly competitive especially for independent venues like World Cafe Live Johnny Brenda‚Äôs MilkBoy Philly Ardmore Music Hall 118 North The Fire and Kung Fu Necktie which are not affiliated with deep-pocketed corporate concerns Live Nation and AEG Live.

So what makes Hornik want to get back into a business where profit margins are thin and touring artists are struggling to sell tickets to budget- and COVID-cautious fans?

‚ÄúI like to say that I‚Äôm in the public space business‚Äù says Hornik 49 who started out operating the Quarry St. Cafe in Old City in the 1990s.

His succession of Philly bars many with a DJ component have included Lucy‚Äôs Hat Shop Soma Lounge Butter and Proto Lounge and Bar Noir. His Parks on Tap beer garden partner is Philadelphia Parks & Recreation. This summer Liberty Point has presented a Tuesday night Philly Grown: Food & Music series paring local chefs and bands.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I really like: how people socialize together‚Äù Hornik says sitting at a high-top table with McNamara and Matt Schenck the production manager and engineer in charge of sound at FCM venues.

‚Äú

I just think there is a pent-up demand for that. . People want to gather together and there‚Äôs no better reason to than to hear live music.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs a look at the three new venues.

Concourse Live

The FCM venue set to make the biggest splash soonest is Concourse Live a spacious subterranean 500-capacity room at 1635 Market Street that could hardly be more conveniently located for commuters. It has an entrance from the concourse at Suburban Station.

Concourse Live will open on Sept. 10 with the Philadelphia Tom Petty Appreciation Band the local all-star ensemble fronted by Pat Finnerty that features members of Dr. Dog The War on Drugs and Strand of Oaks. On Oct. 9 the venue will host Philly buzz band Cosmic Guilt and Peter Bauer of The Walkmen at a kick-off party for the Philly Music Fest (PMF) which begins the next night at Ardmore Music Hall.

Rapper Chill Moody brass band Snacktime Philly indie rockers Clap Your Hands Say Yeah soul band Arthur Thomas & the Funkitorium and The Districts all have Concourse Live dates in the fall.

As a live music venue Concourse Live is a new entity but it‚Äôs not an entirely new venture for Hornik. As Concourse Dance Bar the converted off track betting parlor has been open since 2018 pulling in a young crowd with DJs booked by Rylan Murphy as well as a ball pit and an ice bar.

In 2018 The Inquirer‚Äôs Samantha Melamed called it a ‚Äúhallucinogenic‚Äù experience in a ‚Äúnostalgic playground.‚Äù That aspect of Concourse will continue with DJs starting after the bands finish. Live shows on weekends will start at 7 and end by 10.

Dolphin Tavern

The Dolphin Tavern the South Philly dive bar/dance club at 1539 S. Broad St. which is already in Hornik‚Äôs portfolio has been an indie DJ haven since FCM took it over in 2013.

With the Boot & Saddle gone the 200-capacity Dolphin will aim to be ‚Äúthat missing South Philly venue‚Äù says McNamara complete with the old B&S sound system which Hornik bought when the club shut down.

The venue will keep the disco ball action going with DJs but also add indie bands during the week. Among them: Queasy on Sept. 9 Grace Vonderkuhn on Sept. 29 and Tonstartssbandht on Nov. 6 .

(How long the Dolphin will have South Broad to itself is uncertain. In March The Inquirer reported that Boot & Saddle had plans to reopen as a collaboration between South Philly bar Fountain Porter and avant jazz presenter Ars Nova Workshop but a timetable has yet to be announced. )

Craft Hall

A name hasn‚Äôt been settled on for the third venue in the Philly Independent Productions‚Äô plan that will be built at Craft Hall Hornik‚Äôs brewery and restaurant at 901 N. Delaware Ave.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going back and forth between ‚ÄòThe Philly Independent‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Independent Philly‚Äô‚Äù McNamara says. The room will have a separate entrance from Craft Hall and will be larger than the Dolphin and Concourse Live. This will help bands move into larger venues a concept called horizontal integration Hornik explains.

‚ÄúYou want to be able to book a band in a 200-cap room and then a 500-cap room and then a 700-cap room. So you want to be able to move the bands up and have them realize that this is an independent alternative for the Philadelphia market.‚Äù

The pressure on the new live music rooms to succeed Hornik says will be less ‚Äúbecause these venues already exist and are profitable as is so we have a lot more leeway to take care of the bands better and have more competitive ticket pricing and pay people more because we don‚Äôt have to worry about rent or insurance or electricity.‚Äù

The entry of three new indie venues will increase competition but also new opportunities. With the Dolphin McNamara will be bidding for shows against similar-sized rooms like Johnny Brenda‚Äôs PhilaMOCA and MilkBoy Philly.

The latter however is currently closed for repairs and will likely stay shuttered into the fall Tommy Joyner MilkBoy‚Äôs co-owner (and leader of the band Pep Rally) said last week. Until it reopens MilkBoy is shuffling shows to other venues. McNamara said she had been in discussion about potentially moving some of them ‚Äî like South Philly songwriter Shamir‚Äôs Oct. 14 Philly Music Fest date ‚Äî to the Dolphin.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs terrific‚Äù said PMF chief Greg Seltzer on the addition of the FCM venues. He teamed with McNamara adding the kick-off event to the nonprofit fest and plans to continue to partner with Philly Independent Productions.

‚ÄúMore independent venues means more places for venue staff to work and more places for emerging bands to cut their teeth. And geographically the venues make sense with the Dolphin in South Philly and also the venue in that part of Center City‚Äù because in terms of small rock venues ‚Äúnothing else is there.‚Äù

Concourse Live‚Äôs size puts it between World Cafe Live in West Philly and City Winery Philadelphia which hold 650 and 350 people respectively. There aren‚Äôt that many concert spaces that size in Philadelphia says Hornik.

While there are many venues with around a 2000-seat capacity including the Miller Theater (formerly the Merriam) Academy of Music Verizon Hall the Fillmore Franlin Music Hall and the even larger The Met that 500-person range is neglected Hornik says.

‚ÄúI feel like the rooms that are that size have their own niche. This is going to be a room for independent artists of all different genres‚Äù McNamara says.

McNamara says she expects that once all three venues are up and running there will be approximately 100 shows each year at both Concourse Live and the larger venue at Craft Hall and closer to 150 at the Dolphin because we‚Äôre going to do a lot more local shows there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to be taking market share from these other venues‚Äù Hornik says. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a gap in the market and we‚Äôre going to make the whole pie larger.‚Äù

When the first laser was invented by Theodore Maiman at the Hughes Research Lab in Malibu California in 1960 it was almost immediately seen as a potential superweapon ‚Äì the death-ray of science fiction come to life.

While the ability to generate beams of coherent light provided scientists and engineers with a unique tool that would revolutionize many fields over the next six decades producing a practical laser weapon turned out to be more difficult than first imagined. Today the development of solid-state lasers based on coils of fiber optic cables doped with exotic elements like yttrium have finally moved the laser weapon from the laboratory to the battlefield.

The HELIOS laser weapon installed Lockheed Martin

The HELIOS 60-plus-kW-class multirole laser weapon will not just be deployed as an experiment aboard a US Navy ship as in previous tests but as an operational tactical system that can be fully integrated into ship operations and can be scaled to meet mission requirements. Like other laser weapons HELIOS can project a beam at the speed of light against multiple targets for about a dollar a shot not counting equipment costs and has an unlimited supply of ammunition so long as power is available.

Where HELIOS differs is that it can not only be used to destroy targets it can also to dazzle optical sensors and the reflected beam can gather long-range data for Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) applications. According to Lockheed this makes HELIOS a key element of a layered defense architecture for fleet protection.

""Lockheed Martin and the US Navy share a common vision and enthusiasm for developing and providing disruptive laser weapon systems"" said Rick Cordaro vice president Lockheed Martin Advanced Product Solutions. ""HELIOS enhances the overall combat system effectiveness of the ship to deter future threats and provide additional protection for sailors and we understand we must provide scalable solutions customized to the Navy‚Äôs priorities. HELIOS represents a solid foundation for incremental delivery of robust and powerful laser weapon system capabilities.""

US Aims For Third Successful Hypersonic ARRW Missile Test After 3 Consecutive Failures,"The US Air Force (USAF) seeks to fly its hypersonic AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) at least once more this year after two successful tests in the last four months according to reports.

Gen. Duke Richardson the head of Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) told reporters on August 10 during the AFMC‚Äôs Life Cycle Industry Day event in Dayton Ohio that the upcoming test will be a ‚Äúbig one‚Äù for ARRW.

The AGM-183A ARRW is a long-range hypersonic missile designed by Lockheed Martin for the USAF. The missile is expected to improve USAF‚Äôs hypersonic strike capability to attack heavily defended high-value targets such as enemy military bases and surface warships at stand-off ranges.

The missile is said to have a speed over Mach 5 and a range of approximately 925 kilometers. It is carried under the wing of the B-52H bomber aircraft.

The high-speed component of the missile is being developed utilizing the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency‚Äôs (DARPA) tactical boost glide (TBG) technology where a rocket first propels its payload to hypersonic speeds following which the payload separates from the rocket and glides unpowered toward the target.

Winning Streak After Three Consecutive Failures

The last known test of the ARRW was conducted in July off the Southern California coast which successfully demonstrated the booster performance marking the completion of the booster test phase according to the press release by Eglin Air Force Base. Also the trial marked the second time the ARRW had effectively separated from the B-52 aircraft.

Before that the 419th Flight Test Squadron and the Global Power Combined Test Force conducted a test in May in which the ARRW separated from the launch aircraft and the rocket burned for ‚Äúthe expected duration‚Äù marking the first successful test after a string of three failures in 2021.

The three test flights in 2021 failed because the missile could not separate from the carrier aircraft or failed to launch a booster rocket. The root cause analysis of the most recent failed test suggested that a loose wire did not allow the missile to function as intended.

The US lawmakers cut $161 million in procurement funding that the Biden administration sought for the program in fiscal 2022 following test failures and delays.

Speaking about these test failures and the two consecutive successes after that Gen. Richardson said he‚Äôs been pleased with the Air Force‚Äôs progress on ARRW and described the initial failures as ‚Äúburps‚Äù reported Defense News.

‚ÄúThere is more of an appetite now for test failure. It‚Äôs part of the process‚Äù Richardson said. ‚ÄúWhat we need to do is figure out how we get through failure faster. Because we‚Äôre going to fail.‚Äù

Road Ahead Is Challenging For ARRW

Lockheed Martin‚Äôs Deputy Program Manager for the ARRW program Brian Shappacher said on August 13 during the podcast hosted by the Mitchell Institute that the next phase of testing for the AGM-183A is going to be more complicated than the booster test phase.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still going to focus on the booster of course but we‚Äôre going to shift some additional focus to the glider performance‚Äù Shappacher said.

The USAF requires the ARRW to attain early operational capability in 2023 which according to Shappacher will be challenging.

‚ÄúWe have more missiles to build and more flight tests to get through and complete than we‚Äôve had at any other time in this program intending to reach early operational capability in 2023‚Äù Shappacher noted.

USAF Riding Two Horses To Achieve Hypersonic Capability

Hypersonic weapons are a top priority for the US particularly in response to Russia and China‚Äôs progress in this field.

Currently China and Russia are the only countries with operational hypersonic weapons and Russia has even used its Kinzhal hypersonic missile in the ongoing Ukraine war. In contrast the US is still catching up.

Apart from ARRW the USAF is also pursuing the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) program which intends to develop a smaller less expensive cruise missile based on air-breathing propulsion technology.

For the HACM program Lockheed Martin is competing with Raytheon and Boeing and the USAF is expected to award a contract later this year.

The USAF‚Äôs F-15EX fighter aircraft will be the first to be certified to carry the new HACM as the fighter jet has a larger weapons payload capacity than the F-35 fighter as per a previous EurAsian Times report.

Also reports suggest the HACM is planned to be launched from both bombers and fighter aircraft with a senior USAF official noting that a B-52 could potentially carry 20 HACMs or more.

Gen. Richardson said that by pursuing the ARRW and HACM the USAF is ‚Äúriding two horses‚Äù in terms of hypersonic development setting itself up for a dilemma if there arises a situation where a single effort has to be selected for future investment.

(AP Photo/Stacy Bengs)

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) ‚Äî Marcus Semien and Nathaniel Lowe homered Kohei Arihara pitched a career-high six innings and combined with Taylor Hearn for the shutout and the Texas Rangers beat the Minnesota Twins 7-0 on Sunday.

Minnesota starter Joe Ryan held Texas hitless for the first three innings before Semien led off the fourth with his 19th home run of the season. Semien drove in three runs.

Adolis Garc√≠a extended his hitting streak to 18 games the longest current streak in the majors.

The Rangers won for the third time in four games following a week of dramatic changes. The team fired fourth-year manager Chris Woodward on Monday. President of baseball operations Jon Daniels was fired on Wednesday.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like a clean slate with (interim manager Tony) Beasley‚Äù Semien said of last week's organizational changes. ‚ÄúWhen that stuff happened it just kind of wakes the room up. It‚Äôs unfortunate what happened last week but it wakes the room up and puts everyone on notice that we need to get our stuff together and start playing better.‚Äù

Arihara (1-1) was impressive in just his second major league start of the season. The right-hander from Japan spent most of the season at Triple-A Round Rock. He gave up four hits and pitched into the seventh inning.

‚ÄúI was definitely more settled in this time more relaxed and got into a rhythm quickly‚Äù Arihara said through a translator.

Taylor Hearn came on in relief after the first two batters of the seventh singled off Arihara. Hearn retired three in a row to end the threat and finished off the final three innings for his first career save.

‚ÄúWe pitched outstanding‚Äù Beasley said. ‚ÄúKohei he set the tone for us. I always say that pitching is the face of the game. So he set the tone. He kept us at bay. If he comes out and doesn‚Äôt pitch well none of this offense matters. So he kept the game in a spot where we had a chance to get going offensively.‚Äù

Ryan (9-6) allowed just two hits and two runs but he walked three and was done after 6 1/3 innings when Texas put together a three-run inning off Ryan and reliever Trevor Megill.

The Twins were shut out for the 11th time this season and now trail Cleveland by 1.5 games in the American League Central.

‚ÄúWe expected more from our offense‚Äù Minnesota manager Rocco Baldelli said. ‚ÄúAnd will expect more going forward a lot more. It was a day where there wasn‚Äôt much to even talk about. I think we rolled over on a lot of pitches. And it‚Äôs something I think we could have and should have been ready for. And I think we prepared for the type of pitcher we were facing today. The execution in the batter‚Äôs box has to be better.‚Äù

PICKING IT UP

After a slow start to his first season in Texas Semien is delivering the production expected when he signed a $175 million seven-year contract in the offseason.

Semien was hitting .193 with no homers on May 27. He hit his first home run a day later and now has 19 in 77 games since while hitting .256 during that stretch. With a career-high 19 stolen bases he‚Äôs closing in on his first 20-20 season.

Lowe hit his 18th homer. He‚Äôs hitting .364 since the All-Star break.

TWO MORE

Minnesota completed its Hall of Fame weekend by inducting former outfielder Dan Gladden and utility man C√©sar Tovar a day after an induction ceremony for former manager Ron Gardenhire.

Gladden was the leadoff hitter for the World Series-winning teams in 1987 and 1991. He played five seasons for the Twins and has spent the past 22 as a radio broadcaster for the team.

Tovar spent eight seasons with Twins hitting .281 with 186 steals which are third all-time for the team. In 1968 he became just the second player in history to play all nine positions in the same game.

TRAINER‚ÄôS ROOM

Rangers: OF Kole Calhoun was activated from the injured list after recovering from right heel irritation. Calhoun had been out since Aug. 3 and played in three rehab games in Triple-A where he was 3 for 10 with a hit in each game. IF Josh Smith was optioned to Round Rock.

Twins: RHP Kenta Maeda (Tommy John surgery recovery) has been throwing and is scheduled for another trip to the doctor this week. He could begin throwing live batting practice after the checkup. ‚Ä¶ RHP Bailey Ober (right groin straight) is scheduled to throw a bullpen session on Monday. ‚Ä¶ OF Trevor Larnach (core muscle injury) has started hitting and running. ‚Ä¶ OF Kyle Garlick (right ribcage contusion) is close to a rehab assignment.

UP NEXT

The four-game series continues on Monday night. RHP Sonny Gray (7-3 3.11 ERA) starts for Minnesota while LHP Cole Ragans (0-2 5.02) will start for Texas. Gray tied a season high with 10 strikeouts in six scoreless innings in his last start. Ragans has allowed eight runs and four home runs in 9 1/3 innings over his last two starts.

And though I enjoy moving I hate squeezing into super-tight workout clothes and feeling constricted while I'm getting my workout on. I'm also frugal (I'm a shopping deals writer after all) so shelling out close to $100 for Lululemon leggings just isn't my bag. That's why I was intrigued when I heard about a brand called Colorfulkoala that's on offer at Amazon. Its leggings are a fraction of the price of the name brands but a slew of reviewers have said that they're just as comfy as their beloved Lulus if not more so. Well that was enough to pique my interest: I got a pair of them pronto ‚Äî keep scrolling for my review.

Amazon Colorfulkoala Dreamlux Leggings If life gives you Lululemons take 'em ‚Äî but if you don't want to splurge on them yourself these affordable alternatives look and feel like the real thing. Pros Lightweight feel

Smooth fabric

Waistband stays put

Come in multiple lengths and colors Cons No phone pocket

Lighter colors not totally opaque $34 at Amazon

Colorfulkoala leggings come in many styles that have collectively racked up tens of thousands of perfect ratings from Amazon shoppers. I decided to try their newer Dreamlux Leggings which according to the brand feature a material that ""has a special molecular structure [that makes] it comfortable to the skin and more durable and temperature-resistant than other fabrics.""

Comfort is my top concern when it comes to workout clothes and based on the pair of Lululemon leggings I've tried I understand why some shoppers pay Lulu's prices ‚Äî the fabric is so so soft. Would these $31 leggings compare? (Note: Prices vary between colors.)

First impressions

The first thing I noticed when my leggings arrived was how thin the fabric felt ‚Äî not necessarily a bad thing seeing as thicker leggings often make me heat up. But I did wonder how they'd stack up in the compression department. I tried them on and was pleased with how effortlessly they glided over my legs. There's that buttery-smooth feeling we're all after! They also felt secure without being too snug and 5-foot-tall me was relieved to find that they didn't bunch up at the bottom like most leggings do (I opted for the 25-inch inseam but they also come in a 28-inch length).

In terms of looks they did a good job of smoothing everything out and have a classic clean style that'll pair well with any sports bra or workout top. I don't like the look or feel of leggings with a ton of seams and I appreciate that the ones on these are minimal.

Thirty-one cute colors ‚Äî and you can buy three pairs for less than one pair of comparable Lulus. Um maybe use those savings to get yourself some footwear? (Amazon)

Putting them to the test

I mostly stick to walking and cardio but I figured I should perform the notorious squat test in the event that I wake up one day suddenly eager to strength train (yeah right). The gray-blue hue I chose was opaque enough to keep my underwear from showing through but I can't speak to the lighter colors. (There are 16 options.)

To start I wore the leggings on a 3-mile walk. Since they're very lightweight my legs felt nice and free while I strolled around ‚Äî it was almost as if the leggings were a second skin. I never felt the waistband rolling down or digging in; it just stayed put the entire time.

After a successful walk it was time to see how they fared during a Peloton ride which involves pedaling while both seated and standing. I was impressed by how well they stayed in place even during more intense sprints and the thinner fabric didn't feel constricting. There was enough compression to ensure nothing spilled out and the material also made good on its cooling promise. That said I can't really speak to the moisture-wicking aspect since my legs don't tend to get sweaty.

The verdict

All in all if you're looking for leggings that are comparable to Lululemon Colorfulkoala Dreamlux leggings are an affordable alternative (though they're supremely comfortable in their own right). You can stock up on several colors for less than half the price of many high-end brands which I'd very much advise doing.

These workout pants checked off all the right boxes when it came to comfort support aesthetics and ‚Äî for me at least ‚Äî fit. I will note that while there's a teeny pocket in the inner waistband for keys these leggings do not have a cell phone pocket in case that's important to you. (But this version does! Plus we have a whole roundup of the best leggings with pockets for you to check out.)

Finally leggings that fit my short legs like a glove! (Britt Ross/Yahoo Life)

What Amazon customers say

""Better than Lululemon!"" exclaimed one excited reviewer. ""I can't say enough great things about these leggings! They don't roll down; they feel amazing on. I have all kinds of brands: Lululemon Vuori Athleta etc. and these are my favorites and the ones I feel the best and most confident in!""

""Not only do they feel great but they have stood the test of falling on concrete"" shared this shopper. ""I fell in the pouring rain on my knees and the side of my leg. I instantly thought these were ruined because I could feel my knees were busted. Once I was able to check my wounds I was shocked that these leggings had not one tear rip or snag! My knees were bloody but the leggings survived another day.""

""I love the color they feel great and they are the perfect length for me"" wrote a final fan. ""However if you are looking for squat-proof leggings I would recommend getting a darker color because they are more squat-proof than the lighter colors."" The more you know!

Need a top to go with your new favorite leggings? One Yahoo Life editor swears by this one:

Amazon Lemedy Padded Sports Bra Tank Top ""The moment I tried it on I was intrigued"" wrote Yahoo Life deputy editor Izabella Zaydenberg. ""The Lemedy Sports Bra not only holds you in and supports you like a hug but it actually makes the girls look good too. It's lightly padded so even if you're not packing too much it'll give you a bit of a lift (and you can remove the pads if you like). It's soft and breathable. And about those straps? I was thrilled to discover they don't dig into the shoulders or leave red marks. After working out in it I immediately bought another color.

A Tennessee couple found transporting millions of dollars‚Äô worth of cocaine was killed in Texas on Thursday during a traffic stop shootout with law enforcement authorities said.

Edward and Elizabeth Stevenson were first identified through undercover buys of illegal drugs the Putnam County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Monday.

The undercover work allowed investigators to get a search warrant for the Stevensons' home where detectives uncovered nearly a pound of suspected methamphetamine suspected fentanyl multiple firearms body armor and ammunition on Thursday the sheriff‚Äôs office said.

During the search detectives learned that the Stevensons were driving a semi-truck through Texas with illegal drugs and were armed.

""Both Edward and Elizabeth had made previous statements that they would die by 'suicide by cop' if law enforcement attempted to stop them"" the sheriff‚Äôs office said.

Detectives immediately alerted the Donley County Sheriff's Office in Texas and Texas Department of Public Safety about the couple.

When deputies in Donley County tried to pull over the semi-truck the couple continued to drive for several miles before coming to a stop officials said.

Edward and Elizabeth then exited the vehicle and opened fire on deputies and troopers the sheriff's office said. The Stevensons were killed in the ensuing shootout.

Authorities searched the couple‚Äôs vehicle and found about 64 pounds of suspected cocaine valued at an estimated $3.4 million. The sheriff‚Äôs office said the drugs appeared to be en route to Tennessee.

Putnam County Sheriff Eddie Farris blamed open border policies that are making it ""much easier for Mexican cartel members and their associates"" to traffic illegal drugs into smaller communities.

Farris said the cocaine seized from the Stevensons would likely have been mixed with fentanyl before being sold to individuals.

The sheriff thanked community members for calling in anonymous tips about the couple.

Burnett Plaza the tallest building in Fort Worth Texas has been purchased via foreclosure auction for $12.3 million just three years after it was sold for more than $137.5 million according to the Dallas Business Journal.

The 40-story behemoth was bought back by Pinnacle Bank Texas in the auction held on the steps of the Tarrant County courthouse on Tuesday.

Pinnacle had claimed in public filings that the tower's former owner Burnett Cherry Street LLC an affiliate of New York-based Opal Holdings LLC defaulted on a $13 million loan used to purchase the building in 2021.

Sales,"Francis Bacon's Portrait of George Dyer Crouching (1966) was expected to be the night's top lot. It sold for just $27.7 million failing to even reach its low estimate.

Sotheby‚Äôs kicked off this month‚Äôs marquee New York auctions with two sales on Monday evening one devoted to established contemporary artists the other to emerging ones. Together the two auctions brought in $267.3 million for a total squarely within its pre-sale estimate of $241.8 million to $350.4 million.

These were the first two big auctions to take place during the annual May New York sales with others to follow at Christie‚Äôs and Phillips. All these sales are happening against the backdrop of concerns of a weakening market and fewer estates coming to the block than in previous years. Simply based on estimates alone the sales at Christies Sotheby‚Äôs and Phillips are down by around 18 percent compared to the ones held this time in 2023.

Going into the sale Sotheby‚Äôs at least had a leg up on Christie‚Äôs whose website was still down on Monday reportedly following a cyberattack. But the action at Sotheby‚Äôs this evening was relatively sluggish doing little to dispel fears of a market slowdown.

Monday evening‚Äôs most expensive lot was Francis Bacon‚Äôs 1966 painting Portrait of George Dyer Crouching the first of 10 full-scale portraits by Bacon depicting his lover George Dyer. The work on offer had been in the same collection for 54 years having sold to its consignor in 1970 just four years after Bacon finished it. It came to auction with a $50 million high estimate a number that seemed poised to put the painting among the most expensive ones by Bacon ever sold publicly.

Unfortunately for Sotheby‚Äôs it was a big flop failing to even meet its low estimate. The painting ended up selling for $27.7 million. (All figures reported here include premium unless noted otherwise.) Murmurs abounded; many seemed awed by this hyped work‚Äôs implosion on the block.

Highs and Lows in ‚ÄúNow‚Äù Sale

The evening started out with more modest sums in the 18-lot ‚ÄúThe Now‚Äù sale devoted to the ultra-contemporary category which refers to emerging artists and ones just gaining momentum at auction.

Eighteen lots were due to be offered but one a Cecily Brown painting was withdrawn before the sale‚Äôs start. Sixteen of the lots sold most of them performing respectably and about half selling above their estimates once premiums were counted in.

The top price in the sale was achieved by Kerry James Marshall‚Äôs 2005 painting Vignette #6 which had never before come to auction. It was acquired by its consignor at Jack Shainman Gallery in 2005 and had not been seen at market since then.

Expectations ran high for this painting since another painting from Marshall‚Äôs ‚ÄúVignette‚Äù series sold in 2019 for $18.5 million at Sotheby‚Äôs becoming his second-most expensive painting at auction. This painting which came to auction with a guarantee didn‚Äôt perform quite so well hammering at $6.5 million $500000 below its $7 million low estimate. With premium however that sum rose to $7.48 million.

The other major disappointment was Jeffrey Gibson‚Äôs evening sale debut which came following the inauguration of the artist‚Äôs US Pavilion at the Venice Biennale last month. That should‚Äôve provided ballast for his market‚ÄîSimone Leigh‚Äôs 2022 pavilion certainly did for hers that year‚Äîbut when Gibson‚Äôs 2014 sculpture Always After Now came up for sale at Sotheby‚Äôs it failed to garner a single bid. It was the only work that went unsold in the ‚ÄúNow‚Äù sale tonight.

The big story of the evening was a 2019 Justin Caguiat painting called The saint is never busy. This young New York‚Äìbased painter‚Äôs abstractions had only ever appeared at auction twice in the past and Sotheby‚Äôs clearly thought this one would do well awarding it the primo Lot 1 slot. The house‚Äôs expectations ended up being correct: a six-minute bidding war pushed this painting far beyond its $300000 estimate more than tripling that sum when it sold for $1.09 million a new record for Caguiat.

The other big record in this sale was for Lucy Bull whose abstractions have already done well at auction. Her 2020 painting 16:10 quickly zoomed past its $700000 high estimate‚Äîwhich was admittedly a conservative number given that her work had already sold for $1.76 at Sotheby‚Äôs Hong Kong this past October. It seemed at times as though auctioneer Phyllis Kao could barely keep up. ‚ÄúEverybody gets a turn‚Äù she said smiling as the painting sped past the $1 million mark. It sold for $1.81 million more than doubling the estimate and generating a new benchmark for this 34-year-old painter.

A Low-Risk Contemporary Sale Sees Many Disappointments

Even though the ‚ÄúNow‚Äù sale did generate some momentum the contemporary sale couldn‚Äôt quite sustain the excitement of the evening‚Äôs first hour.

Even discounting the underwhelming Bacon sale other star lots also failed to deliver. A Richard Diebenkorn abstraction from his ‚ÄúOcean Park‚Äù series initially pegged to sell for as much as $25 million failed to find a buyer altogether. The painting‚Äôs consignor according to Artnet News was Lorenzo Fertitta who bought it at Christie‚Äôs New York in 2018 for $23.9 million at the time a new auction record for the artist. On Monday auctioneer Oliver Barker had to fish for bids to even bring it past its $14.8 million low estimate.

A Lucio Fontana ‚ÄúConcetto Spaziale‚Äù painting brought to auction from the Rachofsky Collection threatened to topple the artist‚Äôs record altogether with a $30 million high estimate but it didn‚Äôt even hammer at its $20 million low estimate only meeting that sum once fees were counted in. The hammer price at $19.7 million rose to just under $23 million‚Äîa respectable figure since it still makes the painting one of Fontana‚Äôs most expensive works but one that was lower than the house had aimed for.

A shaped canvas by Frank Stella Ifafa I (1964) appeared on the block shortly after another big Stella sale. In November a Stella from collection of the late Chara Shreyer Honduras Lottery Co. (1962) sold for $18.7 million‚Äîat the time Stella‚Äôs second-highest price at auction. Artnet News‚Äôs Katya Kazakina reported that Ifafa I came to the block from none other than dealer Irving Blum whose Ferus Gallery showed Stella during the ‚Äô60s just as he had achieved renown. The painting hit the block with a $14 million low estimate and hammered right at that amount. Not even the artist‚Äôs death earlier this month had done much to raise interest.

This was a low-risk sale with 25 of the 35 lots coming to auction with guarantees meaning that much of the works had been pre-sold. But even by that measure this sale left something to be desired.

There were some successes. A collaborative painting by Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat from 1984 sold for a new record for the duo‚Äôs series at $19.4 million squarely within the work‚Äôs $15 million‚Äì$20 million estimate. On the Nota Bene podcast earlier this week art adviser Lock Kresler a director at Helly Nahmad gallery in London said this one is considered to be among the best in the series; the highest price for a painting in the series at auction is $11.4 million achieved in 2014. The consignor bought this one at Sotheby‚Äôs in 2010 for just $2.7 million.

Four guaranteed Joan Mitchell paintings headed to auction at Sotheby‚Äôs on Monday with three of them selling for above their estimates. The priciest of them her abstraction Noon (ca. 1969) sold for $22.6 million. Just eight years ago the consignor had bought it at Christie‚Äôs for less than half that value.

Faith Ringgold who died in April saw a new record when Dinner at Gertrude Stein‚Äôs: The French Collection Part II #10 (1991) a quilted painting from the artist‚Äôs prized ‚ÄúFrench Collection‚Äù series came up for sale as the auction‚Äôs first lot. It came to auction from the collection of Stanley and Mikki Weithorn who lent it to a recent Ringgold retrospective. The painting was given a $700000‚Äì$1 million estimate‚Äîdouble the artist‚Äôs auction record of $461000 set at Swann Auction Galleries in 2015. Clearly Sotheby‚Äôs expected Dinner at Gertrude Stein‚Äôs to reset the record for the artist and it did selling for $1.57 million.

The flurry of bids for Ringgold‚Äôs painting made this work a rarity in this sale where the buying activity seemed depressed. By the time an Alice Neel portrait of poet and photographer Gerard Malanga came up for sale Barker was doing his best to stoke any energy at all. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like extracting teeth my goodness‚Äù he said before the work sold for a within-estimate sum of $2.24 million. That remark could‚Äôve been said at many different points tonight.

Still the evening ended on a positive note when Yayoi Kusama‚Äôs 1958 painting The Pacific Ocean sold for $4.66 million triple its high estimate. The work came to sale after its owner curator Alice Denney died last year at 101; seven minutes of bidding preceded that sale. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to forever put Kusama for the last lot!‚Äù Barker yelped. By that point however a good number of attendees had left for the evening so this rare moment of excitement was missed by many.

After three hours anyone who stayed until the end of the sale was probably hungry. But instead of the the usual assortment of cheese crackers and charcuterie available for guests there were only empty champagne glasses.

When ARTnews asked a Sotheby‚Äôs staffer about this change they simply replied ‚ÄúThe market has changed.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL25ld3NjaGFubmVsOS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC90cmFmZmljLXN0b3Atc2hvb3RvdXQtZW5kcy1pbi1kZWF0aC1vZi1wdXRuYW0tY291bnR5LWR1by10cmFuc3BvcnRpbmctM20taW4tY29jYWluZS1lZHdhcmQtc3RldmVuc29uLWVsaXphYmV0aC1zdGV2ZW5zb24tbWlkZGxlLXRlbm5lc3NlZdIBsQFodHRwczovL25ld3NjaGFubmVsOS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvdHJhZmZpYy1zdG9wLXNob290b3V0LWVuZHMtaW4tZGVhdGgtb2YtcHV0bmFtLWNvdW50eS1kdW8tdHJhbnNwb3J0aW5nLTNtLWluLWNvY2FpbmUtZWR3YXJkLXN0ZXZlbnNvbi1lbGl6YWJldGgtc3RldmVuc29uLW1pZGRsZS10ZW5uZXNzZWU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Traffic stop shootout ends in death of Tennessee duo transporting $3M in cocaine,"A Putnam County duo is dead after a shootout with police following a traffic stop where officers discovered the two were transporting more than $3 million worth of cocaine possibly to Middle Tennessee.

Putnam County Sheriff‚Äôs Office Drug Unit began investigating Elizabeth and Edward Stevenson through undercover buys of illegal drugs. This resulted in a search warrant being issued and executed on May 9.

During the search detectives found 3/4 of a pound of suspected methamphetamine suspected fentanyl multiple firearms body armor and ammunition inside of the home.

At the time of the search detectives received information that Elizabeth and Edward Stevenson were driving a semi-truck back through Texas with illegal drugs and were armed.



According to PCSO both individuals had also made previous statements they would die by ‚Äúsuicide by cop‚Äù if law enforcement attempted to stop them.

PCSO detectives immediately notified Donley County Sheriff‚Äôs Office and Texas Department of Public Safety of this information and immediately began a working relationship with these agencies.

When Donley County Sheriff‚Äôs attempted to conduct a traffic stop Edward began to flee in the semi-truck for several miles before coming to a stop. Once stopped Elizabeth and Edward exited the vehicle and began firing at the deputies and troopers resulting in their death.



PCSO did not say whether any law enforcement officers were injured in the exchange of gunfire.

During a search of the vehicle Donley County and the Texas Department of Public Safety along with Texas Rangers located and seized approximately 29 kilos (64 pounds) of suspected cocaine.

According to PCSO the street value of approximately 29 kilos of cocaine would equate to approximately $3.4 million all of which appeared to be coming back to the Putnam County and Upper Cumberland area.

Even though I‚Äôm a Marriott Bonvoy Titanium member this was my first stay at a ‚Äústandard‚Äù Marriott in the United States for as long as I can remember (I generally avoid Marriotts domestically). However this hotel had a convenient location for where we needed to be.

So with all the cost cutting we‚Äôve seen at hotels in the United States since the start of the pandemic how was the stay? Not bad surprisingly‚Ä¶

Booking the Boston Marriott Newton

For our early August stay the Boston Marriott Newton was charging ~$190 per night plus tax.

We paid cash though as a point of comparison the hotel would have cost 39000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night if redeeming points. I value Bonvoy points at 0.7 cents each so paying cash was definitely the better deal as I prefer saving my points for higher value redemptions.

Boston Marriott Newton location

The hotel markets itself as the ‚ÄúBoston Marriott Newton‚Äù though you‚Äôre not going to want to stay here if you want to visit the city of Boston whether for business or leisure. Rather this is a hotel off a highway that‚Äôs near all kinds of businesses and commercial parks that have offices in the Newton area just outside of Boston.

If you‚Äôre staying here plan on having a car or ride sharing since the area isn‚Äôt ideal for walking. Fortunately parking is free if you come by car. The hotel is around 20-30 minutes (depending in traffic) from both the city of Boston and Boston Logan Airport (BOS).

While the hotel underwent a significant interior renovation in 2017 the exterior of the property could still use some love in my opinion.

Boston Marriott Newton lobby & check-in

While the hotel is a bit outdated from the outside the interior is fairly modern especially the lobby. Inside the entrance and to the left were two reception counters while the rest of the lobby consisted of a few different seating arrangements.

I was thanked for being a Bonvoy Titanium member and we were upgraded to a room with a balcony (this hotel has very few suites so I wasn‚Äôt expecting a further upgrade). It was also explained that on account of my status we‚Äôd receive access to the club lounge. However the club lounge is only open in the evenings so we could have breakfast in the restaurant. That worked for us and gave us the best of both worlds.

For what it‚Äôs worth the hotel has seven floors and the lobby is actually on the fourth floor. That‚Äôs because the hotel is built into a small hill so the side of the hotel you enter on is a bit elevated. We were assigned a room on the second floor.

Boston Marriott Newton king balcony room

Once we were down on the second floor we followed the signage in the direction of our room #229. The room was about halfway down the hall and on the left.

The room was pretty much brand standard for Marriott. I think this is often the issue with reviewing chain hotels that have cookie-cutter design. The room was exactly what you‚Äôd expect for a (fairly) recently renovated Marriott. On one side of the room was a king size bed and a chair with a lamp.

On the other side of the room was a desk with a rolling chair (it‚Äôs nice to see those in Marriott rooms since many hotels have eliminated desks) a wall-mounted TV and a luggage rack. There was also a minibar setup with a coffee machine and an empty mini fridge.

The bathroom had a sink toilet and shower & tub combo and was absolutely tiny to the point that you basically had to be touching the toilet with your leg in order to use the sink. On the plus side the water pressure in the shower was pretty decent.

Toiletries were from both Pharmacopia and thisworks and were pretty decent.

One thing that stood out to me about the room was the ‚Äúpopcorn‚Äù ceiling combined with a bad paint job which definitely didn‚Äôt feel very premium and doesn‚Äôt match the rest of the renovation.

The room also had not one but two connecting doors. There was one near the bathroom on one side of the room and one near the bed on the other side of the room. Usually that would bother me but surprisingly there was no noise from nearby rooms so it didn‚Äôt turn out to be an issue.

Marriott Newton king room

The room also had a balcony with two chairs and a side table.

The hotel overlooks the Charles River though our room just looked at a very big tree plus a permanent(ish) tent that was presumably set up for events.

All-in-all the room was perfectly nice and did the trick. When the hotel was renovated in 2017 I think the press release about the new rooms being the ‚Äúpinnacle of luxury‚Äù is probably a bit of an exaggeration but‚Ä¶ üòâ

As a Bonvoy elite member I received premium internet for free which was fast. The hotel also offers daily housekeeping but only on demand. You couldn‚Äôt request it in advance but rather each morning you had to let the front desk know if you wanted housekeeping.

Boston Marriott Newton club lounge

As mentioned above the Marriott Newton has a club lounge on the seventh floor. At the moment it‚Äôs only open Sundays through Thursdays from 5PM until 10PM. It‚Äôs not open during the day and clearly the days of the week are designed around business travelers.

It‚Äôs sad how low our expectations as consumers have become as a result of coronavirus but I remember thinking to myself ‚Äúwow how generous that they‚Äôve opened the club lounge‚Äù given how many other hotels haven‚Äôt.

Marriott Newton club lounge exterior

The lounge itself was what you‚Äôd expect from a Marriott. There were some tables with a couple of chairs each some booths and some high-top seating near the windows.

What drives me bonkers about club lounges in the United States is how they assume everyone wants to watch TV. There were two TVs on in the lounge playing different things both at very high volumes. Am I the only one who wishes club lounges would go for a more relaxing ambiance? Why not play some calming background music or something?

The food spread was put out shortly after 5PM. Admittedly the quality of club lounges varies greatly around the globe so this one was pretty standard for a domestic property.

Marriott Newton club lounge buffet

The evening food selection consisted of a few types of packaged snacks (chips and granola bars) plus three fresh options.

Marriott Newton club lounge snacks

These options alternated slightly every evening but generally included some kind of salad some kind of fruit and some kind of veggies (in some cases with cheese). While the selection was limited frankly I appreciated that the options were fresh and reasonably healthy. Other properties have much less healthy options with things like pigs in a blanket fried spring rolls and nachos with cheese. So kudos to the hotel for that at least.

In terms of drinks there was complimentary bottled water and soft drinks plus a coffee station.

As it standard at Marriotts in the United States drinks were with an honor bar system and cost $6-9 each.

The bright point of the club lounge was the attendant who had such a good attitude and was eager to please (sadly I forgot to write down her name but she worked every night). Nonetheless it‚Äôs kind of amazing how the quality of club lounges varies based on the brand you‚Äôre staying at and where in the world you are.

Boston Marriott Newton Riverbend Bar & Grill

Riverbend Bar & Grill is the Marriott Newton‚Äôs all-day dining restaurant located on the lobby level (the fourth floor). Breakfast is served here each morning from 7AM until 11AM and since the club lounge isn‚Äôt open for breakfast we could eat here instead. This space had both a lounge and bar area and then deeper in was the restaurant.

We were given breakfast vouchers for the buffet which ordinarily retails for $20 per person. Again it‚Äôs a reflection of the low expectations I have of many Marriotts but I appreciated that they gave us the full breakfast. Many Marriotts would try to offer elite members a continental breakfast so that there‚Äôs an upcharge for the full buffet.

The breakfast buffet was quite good with fresh fruit yogurt cereal pastries oatmeal smoked salmon and several hot dishes including scrambled eggs breakfast potatoes sausage and more.

Cooked-to-order omelets were also available at no extra cost so I had a veggie omelet each morning.

Boston Marriott Newton Starbucks lobby kiosk

Also on the lobby level the Marriott Newton has a Starbucks kiosk. It has fairly limited hours ‚Äî it‚Äôs open from 6:30AM until 11AM on weekdays and from 7AM until 12PM on weekends. I appreciate when hotels offer easy access to coffee so this was a great option to have whether wanting a hot or iced coffee. I just wish the hours were longer because as an early riser 6:30AM doesn‚Äôt really cut it!

There was also a gift shop of sorts next to the coffee kiosk where you could purchase a drink or snack. This was available even when the Starbucks kiosk was closed and they could just ring you up at the front desk.

Boston Marriott Newton gym & pool

The Marriott Newton has both a gym and pool on the second floor and this was right down the hall from us. The gym had a good selection of equipment. I don‚Äôt think the hotel was very full during our stay so it was nice to almost always have the gym to ourselves. However this is a 430-room hotel so I imagine when it‚Äôs busy this place could get very crowded.

There was also an indoor pool. I‚Äôm not much of a pool guy even at a nice resort let alone an indoor pool at a business hotel. I imagine some families appreciate this amenity though especially in winter.

Bottom line

The Marriott Newton is a perfectly decent business hotel if you have a need to be in the area. The hotel is huge and cookie-cutter but that‚Äôs kind of what you expect from your average Marriott in the US right?

On the plus side the staff at the hotel were friendly and I appreciate that the hotel‚Äôs club lounge is open in the evenings and that elite members receive a full (hot) breakfast in the restaurant in the mornings. That‚Äôs how it should be but it‚Äôs also an area where some other hotels are much stingier.

I certainly wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to stay here again but if I needed to be in the immediate area I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to return.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnQvNDEwMDg0MTIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AC Hotels by Marriott Debuts First Hotel in Monterrey Nuevo Le√≥n,"AC Hotels by Marriott¬Æ the design-driven lifestyle brand part of Marriott Bonvoy's portfolio of 30 extraordinary brands today announced the opening of the new AC Hotel by Marriott Monterrey Valle its first hotel in the city of Monterrey.

The 350 rooms are small(ish) at around 17 sqm but seem larger partly because of the floor-to-ceiling windows and partly because of the design which makes the most of the space that there is.

There are hangers along the wall opposite the bed (rather than wardrobes) storage space under the bed (including the laptop-sized safe) and the narrow washbasin in the corridor as you enter the room opposite the separate toilet and good-sized shower. There were a couple of small bottles of water for sale on the basin ($5 each) but if you have a refillable bottle (and you should have!) there is a place to fill it in the basement fitness centre.

The dispensers for toiletries in the shower are on the wall good for the environment if difficult to extract anything from but there is no separate bin for recycling.

There‚Äôs a full length mirror by the door the bed is very comfortable and there is a small work desk which folds down from the wall and a collapsible chair (when you arrive it is hanging on the wall ‚Äì I thought it was the luggage rack at first). I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd want to work at the table sitting on that chair for long and if I had done so I would have required medical help to leave the room but the table is a good place to store and charge things and there are also charging points all around the room including both USB docks and US main sockets on both sides of the double bed.

There are limited number of room types with standard rooms being on floors 4-21 and then those with a city view being on 22-32. Note that one side of the building faces towards the Empire State Building and so you want (if available) to have one of those on one of the higher floors though there aren‚Äôt many of them.

There are 226 King rooms (17.7 sqm) and then a further five of these are King View; Double rooms are 18 sqm and there are 95 of these with just a further five Double Views. Some rooms allow for four to stay ‚Äì these are called a Quad Bunk and there are 17 of these. Then there is the Mondo Suite which is 70 sqm without bedrooms (when you would use it as an event space) or can be used with one or two adjoining King bedrooms.

The best rooms are higher up the building and on one side these have outstanding views of the Empire State Building. In fact this view is one of the best I have ever experienced in over 50 visits to New York. Yes you can stay south of Central Park but the price for that view would be four times as much.

I spent a lot of time taking pictures of the view not least when a praying mantis came to visit and watch me through the window. I wasted an hour or so videoing it but to be fair it seemed just as interested in me. It was also fun watching it climb up and down the Empire State Building though instead of Godzilla it was more like the insect in the Edgar Allen Poe story The Sphinx (interestingly written at a time of contagion ‚Äì cholera ‚Äì and set just north of New Rok in a house overlooking the Hudson.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9ob3ctdG8tZWFybi1taWxlcy11bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtbWlsZWFnZXBsdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earn miles with the United Airlines MileagePlus program,"United MileagePlus miles may not be as valuable as they once were but they have their place.

You can use them for United Airlines and Star Alliance partner awards with no fuel surcharges saving you hundreds of dollars per ticket. Further the airline frequently offers low-cost domestic award tickets and reasonable pricing on long-haul international business class tickets operated by United.

It's also easy to redeem United MileagePlus miles. United's website is well designed and shows nearly all available Star Alliance flights online. Because of this it's an excellent program for points and miles newcomers who want to earn and redeem miles quickly.

In this article I'll show you the best ways to earn United miles ‚Äî many of which don't require stepping on a plane.

Earn United miles by flying

As you'd expect you can earn United miles by flying with the carrier or one of its partners. However how you earn United miles depends on several factors including the airline operating the flight how you booked the flight and your fare class. Let's take a closer look.

Flying on United

Over the years United has changed how you earn miles when flying on United-operated flights. Instead of earning based on miles flown you now earn MileagePlus miles based on your ticket's base price (minus taxes). You'll also earn additional miles if you have MileagePlus elite status ‚Äî the higher your status the more miles you earn.

Here's how many miles you'll earn per dollar spent based on your level of status:

General member : 5 miles.

: 5 miles. Premier Silver : 7 miles.

: 7 miles. Premier Gold : 8 miles.

: 8 miles. Premier Platinum : 9 miles.

: 9 miles. Premier 1K: 11 miles.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

Here's an example of how this works. If you buy a one-way United ticket from Chicago to Des Moines with a base fare of $210 and $30 in taxes you'll earn 1050 miles as a MileagePlus traveler without status. However if you're a top-tier Premier 1K member that earning jumps to 2310 miles.

Note that these earning rates apply even if you're booked into United's basic economy fare class.

United flights also count toward earning Premier status though the carrier changed this process significantly for the 2020 qualification year. Instead of earning status based on miles flown you'll now earn it based on how many Premier qualifying points (PQP) you earn or a combination of how many PQPs you earn and Premier qualifying flights (PQF) you take.

PQP is determined based on how much you spend on flights and PQF is based on the number of segments flown on United or its partner airlines.

Flying Star Alliance partners

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

You can earn United MileagePlus miles when flying any of United's Star Alliance or non-alliance partners ‚Äî but it can be a little tricky.

Suppose you book a partner flight through United with a United Airlines ticket number. In that case you'll earn miles the same as if you were flying on a United-operated flight: based on the base fare of your ticket and your elite status level (as detailed above). However if you book the ticket on a partner ticket stock you'll earn miles based on your fare class and how long your flight is.

Fares are usually booked on a partner ticket stock when you book directly through the partner airline. For example if you're flying on Lufthansa and booked on Lufthansa.com you're almost definitely booked on Lufthansa ticket stock. If you book through an online travel agency (OTA) like Orbitz or a credit card portal like the Chase Ultimate Rewards Travel Portal or Amex Travel these methods may book you on partner ticket stock.

You can verify that a ticket was booked on partner ticket stock by looking at the e-ticket issued after booking. If the ticket number starts with 016 it's on United ticket stock.

The mileage earning rates vary from airline to airline. So check your booking class by looking at your ticket or calling the airline. Then head over to United's list of partner airlines click on your airline and find the corresponding fare class on that list.

To figure out how many miles you'll earn just multiply the mileage flown by the percentage in the ""Award mile earnings"" column. As you'd expect fares booked in premium cabins generally earn more miles than economy tickets.

United elite status on partner flights

One of the best ways to qualify for United Premier status is by flying on long-haul premium-cabin Star Alliance tickets. As mentioned you generally earn around 1 PQP per dollar spent on United flights. However on partner airlines you can sometimes earn over 3 PQPs for each dollar you spend.

Refer to our guide on earning PQPs with partner flights to learn how flying on United's partners can help you qualify for United status. Just keep in mind that United requires at least four paid flights per year to be on United or United Express to qualify for any status level.

On tickets ticketed and operated by Air Canada ANA Austrian Azul Brussels Lufthansa and SWISS Premier members earn bonus miles (but no bonus PQPs):

Premier Silver : 25% bonus.

: 25% bonus. Premier Gold: 50% bonus.

50% bonus. Premier Platinum : 75% bonus.

: 75% bonus. Premier 1K: 100% bonus.

Let's unpack this by looking at a real example on a Lufthansa ticketed and operated flight. We'll start with United's earning chart for Lufthansa.

(Screenshot from united.com)

Let's say you're flying from New York to Munich. Your flight is booked in Z-fare business class meaning that you'd earn 150% of the mileage flown as per the earning chart above. The flight from New York to Munich clocks in at 4038 miles so you'd earn 6057 redeemable miles. The math looks like this: 4038 * 1.50 = 6057.

As noted above a United Premier Gold member would earn an additional 50% of miles flown giving them 9086 miles for this example. Here's the math: (4038 * 1.50) * 1.50 = 9085.5 which would round up to 9086.

To determine the distance between two airports use GCmap.com and input your departure and arrival airport codes. It'll then tell you how far apart the two are in miles.

Transfer Ultimate Rewards points to United

Chase Ultimate Rewards is a popular transferable point currency. Although there are many ways to redeem Ultimate Rewards points the most lucrative is to transfer points to one of Chase's airline or hotel transfer partners.

United is one of Chase's airline transfer partners. So you can transfer Chase points to United at a 1:1 ratio effectively turning 1000 Ultimate Rewards points into 1000 United miles. Ultimate Rewards has various other transfer partners including Air France-KLM Flying Blue British Airways Avios and World of Hyatt. This added flexibility is why we recommend earning Ultimate Rewards points over United miles.

Chase's suite of Ultimate Rewards-earning credit cards may be a better fit for your wallet. They have broader bonus categories than United's cobranded cards. So even if you only plan on transferring your points to United there's a good chance you'll come out ahead with an Ultimate Rewards card.

Here are some of our favorite Ultimate Rewards-earning credit cards that you may want to add to your wallet.

Chase Sapphire Preferred Card

Annual fee: $95.

Sign-up bonus: Earn 75000 bonus points after you spend $4000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.

Earning points: The card earns 5 points per dollar on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards 3 points per dollar on dining (including eligible delivery services takeout and dining out) 3 points per dollar on select streaming services 3 points per dollar on online grocery purchases 2 points per dollar on all other travel and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.

Card perks: Chase Sapphire Preferred Cardholders get a complimentary DoorDash Dashpass for a minimum of one year. Cardholders also earn 5 points per dollar on Lyft rides through March 2025. Points redeemed through the Ultimate Rewards Travel portal are worth 25% more.

The only downside to getting an Ultimate Rewards credit card over a United cobranded card is the benefits; these cards don't offer free checked bags priority boarding or other United benefits. The Sapphire Reserve does offer other travel benefits like a Priority Pass Select membership. Still United flyers may not find it as valuable as a United Club membership on domestic flights.

Earn United miles with Marriott Bonvoy credit cards

One of the Marriott Bonvoy program's best perks is that you can transfer Marriott points to the program's many airline transfer partners. You can transfer Marriott points to most airline partners at a 3:1 ratio meaning three Marriott points equal one airline mile. Plus you'll get a 5000-mile bonus for every 60000 Marriott points you transfer.

United has a preferred transfer rate due to the airline's RewardsPlus partnership with Marriott. As of the time of writing Marriott points transfer to United MileagePlus at a 3:1.1 ratio. This is in addition to the 5000-mile bonus we mentioned earlier so transferring 60000 Marriott points to United results in 27000 United miles.

Related: When does it make sense to transfer Marriott points to airlines?

To transfer Marriott points to United log into your Marriott Bonvoy account head to the Transfer Points to Miles page and click the Transfer Points button at the center of the screen. Then select United from the airline drop-down menu enter your United MileagePlus number and enter how many points you'd like to transfer. Click the Continue button at the bottom of the window to initiate the transfer and the miles will appear in your United account within 48 hours.

Earn United miles with travel partners

Beyond airlines United has a handful of other travel partners like cruise lines hotels and rental car companies. Here's a quick look at all some of these partners and how to earn with them.

MileagePlus cruise portal

The MileagePlus cruise portal lets you earn and redeem United miles for booking a cruise.

While the earn and redemption rates vary you can typically get around 0.6 cents per mile. This is significantly less than the 1.4 cents TPG values United miles. So you're better off using the booking portal to earn United miles on your cruise. It's not unusual to earn up to 45000 bonus miles per booking even on low-cost cruises.

Booking hotels with United partners

United has a suite of hotel partners too. You can earn miles based on your hotel stay costs using the United Hotels portal RocketMiles and Points Hound. Each of these online travel agencies (OTAs) lets you book and pay through their website to earn miles on your hotel stays.

Unfortunately you won't earn hotel points or get hotel elite status benefits when booking through these portals. We only recommend booking independent hotels and stays at hotels where you otherwise wouldn't earn rewards. Further always make sure to compare the cost of the stay with booking directly.

United also has a partnership with Villas of Distinction where you can earn 3 miles per dollar on luxury vacation villas.

You can also earn United miles when you book directly with a handful of United's travel hotel partners. Sometimes this means you'll earn based on the price of your hotel stay. Other times it means transferring points from a hotel program to United MileagePlus.

Here's a look at how many miles you can earn:

Hotel Earning rate Accor Live Limitless Points transfer at a 2000:1000 ratio. Choice Privileges Earn 250 miles per stay. Points transfer at a 5000:1000 ratio. World of Hyatt Earn 500 miles per stay. Points transfer a 2.5:1 ratio. Plus receive a 5000-mile bonus when you convert 50000 points into 20000 miles. Hilton Honors Points transfer at a 10000:1000 ratio. IHG One Rewards Earn up to 2 miles per dollar depending on the property. Points transfer at 10000:2000 ratio. Marriott Bonvoy Earn up to 2 miles per dollar depending on the property. Points transfer at a 3:1.1 ratio with a 5000-mile bonus awarded for every 60000 transferred. You can also visit united.com/MarriottBonus to earn 500 miles on Marriott stays that link with your United flights. Marriott Vacation Club Vacation Club points transfer at a 500:8000 ratio. Up to 40000 miles per member per year. Radisson Rewards Points transfer at a 2000:200 ratio. Shangri-La Gold Circle Earn 500 miles per stay. Points transfer at a 2500:2500 ratio. Wyndham Rewards Earn up to 2 miles per dollar depending on the status level. Points transfer at a 6000:1200 ratio.

Rental car partners

MileagePlus members can earn up to 1250 award miles per qualifying rental. Also get savings of up to 35% off with the MileagePlus Avis Worldwide Discount (AWD #) A791500 and Budget Customer Discount (BCD #) B204900.

Here's what you can expect to earn on an Avis or Budget rental with your status:

No status : 500 miles.

: 750 miles. Premier Silver and Gold members : 1000 miles.

: 1000 miles. Premier Platinum and Premier 1K members: 1250 miles.

United packages

United also offers vacation packages where you can book a flight and hotel; flight and car; or a flight hotel and car. Priceline powers this service. When I ran a seven-night flight hotel and car package search from San Francisco to Los Angeles it clocked in at just under $2000 with a compact car from Budget and a standard king room at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel.

By booking a package I'd get two free rental car days and 1000 bonus miles as a limited-time offer.

Earn United miles with other partnerships

While flying and using cobranded credit cards are the primary methods to earn United miles quickly there are also many non-travel-related MileagePlus partners. Here are some of our favorites to help you earn extra United miles.

MileagePlus Shopping

Like most airlines United operates an online shopping portal (MileagePlus Shopping) where you can earn miles for making everyday purchases online. Just sign up for an account and find your merchant on the site before making a purchase.

Starting at this portal rather than the specific retailer's site will give you extra miles on your purchases in addition to the rewards you'll earn using your credit card of choice. This can be a great way to earn 1 2 or even 5 additional miles when shopping online.

In addition MileagePlus Shopping frequently runs holiday and seasonal promotions. Keep an eye out for these promotions and use them to earn even more on your online purchases.

However we recommend using a shopping portal aggregator like Cash Back Monitor to see which portal offers the best return on your purchases.

MileagePlus X app

Download the MileagePlus X app to earn United miles on the go. Simply put you use the app to buy gift cards to select merchants. The gift card is available immediately and you can purchase it in any amount. When making a MileagePlus X purchase you'll earn a select number of miles per dollar.

Participating merchants include major brands like Walmart Staples and Panera Bread. Be sure to give it a look before you make your next purchase. One of the best things about the MileagePlus X app is that miles are awarded instantly in most cases. So if you're ever a few miles away from a redemption buy a gift card to a store or restaurant you frequent.

Best of all primary United Chase Cardmembers earn a 25% bonus on miles earned from MileagePlus on eGift Card purchases.

United MileagePlus Dining

(Photo by Nick Ellis/The Points Guy)

Like most other domestic carriers United has a dining rewards program that's part of Rewards Network: MileagePlus Dining.

In short this is a shopping portal for eating out. Just sign up for an account and link the credit cards you use for dining. You'll earn up to 5 miles per dollar when you swipe a linked card at participating restaurants. These earnings are in addition to what you earn on the credit card you use so be sure to use one that offers a category bonus on dining purchases.

To maximize your earnings with MileagePlus Dining you'll want to get select status and try to snag VIP status. Becoming a select member is easy: sign up for the program and enable email alerts. Doing so will get you an earning rate of 3 miles per dollar.

Once you've made 11 dining purchases in twelve months you'll reach VIP status and start taking home 5 miles per dollar. If you don't opt in to receive emails from MileagePlus Dining you're considered a basic member (and will only earn 1 mile per $2 spent).

United's PerksPlus program lets businesses earn rewards on employee travel. Sign up for the program and you'll be issued a PerksPlus number that you your employees and your travel agent can add to work-sponsored travel operated by United All Nippon Airways (ANA) Austrian Airlines Brussels Airlines Lufthansa and SWISS. Your business will earn PerksPlus points based on the cost of a ticket.

You can redeem these points for United elite status for employees award travel certificates United Club memberships and more. You can use these to reduce employee travel costs or enhance your travel experience. PerksPlus points are earned in addition to the miles an employee earns when traveling so both parties win. Check out United's PerksPlus website to learn more and enroll.

Buy United miles

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

If you need United miles in a pinch you can opt to buy them from the airline. Unfortunately however it's usually quite expensive to do this. The standard price for United miles is well over 2 cents per mile which is rarely worth it unless you need to buy a small number of miles to top up for an award.

United frequently runs mileage sales that drop the cost of miles considerably. Even so you should only buy miles when you have a specific redemption in mind and have already found bookable award space. Be sure to compare the cost of an award ticket against the cash fare before booking with miles.

Bottom line

As you can see there are many ways you can earn United miles. The most robust approach is to use the above methods in tandem. If you use all of the discussed earning methods at once you'll unlock some terrific earning rates that will quickly get you within striking distance of your next award trip.

We recommend starting with a credit card to earn United miles on everyday purchases and then moving on to the other methods discussed. This will ensure you're leaving no miles on the table when you book travel and make everyday purchases.

The IRA Chief Executive Officer Alhaj Kaddunabbi Ibrahim Lubega told journalists in Kampala that the insurance question around the project was already resolved.

While there have been global campaigns urging international Insurance firms from insuring the project Lubega revealed that EACOP has been insured by Insurance Consortium for Oil and Gas in Uganda (ICOGU). According to Lubega ICOGU has begun underwriting the oil and gas projects in the Albertine including the pipeline from Uganda to the Port of Tanga in Tanzania.

‚ÄúWe have policies on the pipeline on Tilenga on Kingfisher and this gives us hope moving forward‚Äù said Lubega. The revelation by the Authority contradicts a Financial Times report in mid-May indicating that American Insurance Giant Marsh McLennan had bid for and won the contract to find insurers for the East African Crude Oil Pipeline project.

However according to IRA one of the members of the Insurance Consortium for Oil and Gas in Uganda has been selected as the lead underwriter. The Authority‚Äôs Manager in charge of Regulation Steven Kaddu Mukasa remained guarded when pressed to reveal the name of the purported lead underwriter from Uganda.

He insisted that the local insurance industry has taken up the risk and that their policies are under review. ‚ÄúAnd we have seen the participants because it is a consortium we have seen the participants take up the shares that they are to take up‚Äù said Mukasa

The global campaign against EACOP has sent banks insurance companies and brokers into secrecy about the oil and gas projects in Uganda. According to Mukasa the leader of the consortium will take care of the underwriting processes and will be in charge of documentation and will share it with other participants in the consortium.

‚ÄúSo I want to confirm that there is a consortium. And the arrangement has been approved by IRA‚Äù said Mukasa in March 2019. The Insurance Regulatory Authority 2019 issued the Uganda oil and gas co-insurance consortium guidelines to guide local insurers seeking to take up jobs in the oil and gas sector.

It is anticipated that under a consortium local insurers will be able to pool financial and technical capacity to participate in the underwriting of oil and gas risks. While the local insurers under the consortium may be able to underwrite aspects of the oil and gas projects some of the experienced players in the insurance industry have maintained that there will still be a need to attract foreign insurance firms.

CEO of Minet Uganda Maurice Amogola has previously indicated to URN that the risk being retained locally will be quite small in terms of the value within the oil and gas industry. Other experts have suggested that the limited number of reinsurance firms in Uganda may further limit the share of the risk to be retained in Uganda. According to the Ministry of Finance there were only two local reinsurance firms in Uganda.

There were also plans to allow Kenya Reinsurance in the Uganda market to underwrite the reinsurance business and thereby retain within the region. While Alhaj Kaddunabbi agrees that Uganda has only two reinsurance operators he told journalists that part of the value of the risk will be retained locally.

‚ÄúThe way insurance works you avoid concentration of the risk in any market. In view of the numbers we are looking at in the oil and gas we don‚Äôt expect it to concentrate in any country. Many countries are going to be taking part in the premiums that are coming from oil and gas‚Äù said Lubega.

He said it is a trend globally that there is no economy that underwrites its big risks like oil and gas. ‚ÄúAnd this is our role as the regulator to ensure that whoever underwrites only retains what I within his capacity‚Äù he added.

He noted that other than two reinsurance firms in Uganda there is also Zepri or PTA Reinsurance Corporation and Africa Reinsurance Corporation which are also taken as local reinsurance firms. ‚ÄúSo when you have four reinsurance companies operating peacefully in your market that is a good number‚Äù Amogola said.

Unlike co-insurance where several insurance companies come together to issue one single risk reinsurers are typically the insurers of the last resort. The insurance business is based on laws of probability which presupposes that only a fraction of the policies issued would result in claims.

As a result the total sum insured by an insurance company would be several times its net worth. It is based on this same probability of loss that insurance companies fix the insurance premium. The premiums are fixed in such a manner that the total premium collected would be enough to pay for the total claims incurred after providing for expenses.

Twelve months ago they passed the 40 points mark this time it was even more emphatic as they collected 53. And all this without the likes of Jan Frodeno and Lucy Charles-Barclay who had played starring roles in 2021.

Team International had a decent day with four individual wins but it was a shocking afternoon for Team USA as they failed to collect a single victory and took home the ‚ÄòBroken Spokes‚Äô trophy as a result.

Match 1 ‚Äì Daniela Ryf vs. Sarah True vs. Flora Duffy

Flora Duffy led the swim (with a fastest of the day 25:33) but it was a Daniela Ryf masterclass from that point onwards.

The reigning IRONMAN World Champion completely erased the memory of a difficult day here 12 months ago as she took control on the bike and then stretched her advantage over the all-important six minutes mark on the run.

Olympic and Commonwealth Champion Duffy stayed on well for second and herself claimed a bonus point over Sarah True in third.

Results

Points: Team Europe 6 Team International 3 Team USA 1

Match 2 ‚Äì Laura Philipp vs. Chelsea Sodaro vs. Ashleigh Gentle

This turned into an absorbing battle between Ashleigh Gentle and Laura Philipp.

Gentle led by over a minute in the water but it all changed on the bike as Philipp moved into the lead and Chelsea Sodaro dropped out of contention.

But Gentle was back in front on the run and worked hard to earn a bonus half point as she extended the lead to 2:33 on the line admitting afterwards: ‚ÄúI left it all out there and am ruined!‚Äù

Results

1. Ashleigh Gentle (INT) ‚Äì 3:30:51

2. Laura Philipp (EUR) ‚Äì 3:33:24

3. Chelsea Sodaro (USA) ‚Äì 3:46:23

Points: Team International 5 Team Europe 3.5 Team USA 1

Match 3 ‚Äì Kat Matthews vs. Skye Moench vs. Paula Findlay

Team International made it two wins out of two to take an early lead at this point as Paula Findlay routed the opposition.

She was first out of the water with Kat Matthews at +20s and Skye Moench +54s.

All three are strong on the bike but Findlay was in a class of her own today and put the issue beyond doubt on two wheels before ramming home the advantage to collect maximum points.

Results

Points: Team International 6 Team Europe 2 Team USA 1

Match 4 ‚Äì Nicola Spirig vs. Sophie Watts vs. Vittoria Lopes

Anyone who doubted whether triathlon legend Nicola Spirig merited her Captains‚Äô Pick was put firmly in their place in stunning style by the former Olympic Champion on her last international appearance.

It was no surprise to see uber-swimmer Vittoria Lopes first out of the water but Spirig was just 25 seconds behind and Sophie Watts over two minutes back.

And Spirig wasted little time powering to the front on the bike and was out on her own from that point another to collect the full six points. Watt ended her race in the medical tent but was reported to have made a full recovery.

Results

1. Nicola Spirig (EUR) ‚Äì 3:32:44

2. Vittoria Lopes (INT) ‚Äì 3:49:17

3. Sophie Watts (USA) ‚Äì DNF

Points: Team Europe 6 Team International 3.5 Team USA 1

Match 5 ‚Äì Holly Lawrence vs. Jocelyn McCauley vs. Ellie Salthouse

Another successful Captains‚Äô Pick for Team Europe as wildcard Holly Lawrence notched the win.

There was very little between herself and arch rival Ellie Salthouse on the swim and there were echoes early on the bike of 12 months ago when they were locked together.

Thankfully there was no repeat of Lawrence‚Äôs crash this time though she was passed on the bike by Jocelyn McCauley but kept her cool and then asserted for another clear-cut victory.

‚ÄúLast year I crashed so I was stoked to get maximum points today‚Äù said Lawrence afterwards.

Results

1. Holly Lawrence (EUR) ‚Äì 3:33:10

2. Jocelyn McCauley (USA) ‚Äì 3:37:43

3. Ellie Salthouse (INT) ‚Äì 3:46:28

Points: Team Europe 5.5 Team USA 3.5 Team International 1

Match 6 ‚Äì Anne Haug vs. Jackie Hering vs. Tamara Jewett

Anne Haug rounded off a great six matches on the female side for Europe by notching a hard-fought victory over Tamara Jewett.

The swim in this heat couldn‚Äôt have been closer with nothing between the trio from start to finish.

And Jewett produced an excellent display to keep Haug up to her work.

But as Jackie Hering came across the line in third there was no getting away from the fact that in the women‚Äôs races Team USA were largely off the pace ‚Äì with no wins and just one second place to show for their efforts.

Results

1. Anne Haug (EUR) ‚Äì 3:33:57

2. Tamara Jewett (INT) ‚Äì 3:35:42

3. Jackie Hering (USA) ‚Äì 3:39:21

Points: Team Europe 4 Team International 2.5 Team USA 1

Match 7 ‚Äì Kristian Blummenfelt vs. Ban Kanute vs. Hayden Wilde

A fascinating matchup on paper but reigning Olympic and IRONMAN World Champion Kristian Blummenfelt was a class apart.

He was third after the swim as Kanute led it out but just six seconds separated the trio.

It was close early on the bike too but then ‚ÄòBig Blu‚Äô put on the burners deep into the bike. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where I tried to put the hammer down as I knew Hayden was coming from short-course‚Äù he explained afterwards.

Wilde stuck on gamely for second but Blummenfelt was already being interviewed by the time he crossed the line.

Results

Points: Team Europe 6 Team International 2.5 Team USA 1

Match 8 ‚Äì Sam Laidlow vs. Sam Long vs. Lionel Sanders

The match with the most eyes on it after the feisty build up ‚Äì and how it lived up to expectations!

Sam Laidlow looked to be backing up the trash talk when he led by over three minutes in the swim Sam Long and Lionel Sanders together at +3:17.

But it was always going to be the bike / run when it mattered and that pair had surged past the Frenchman with Long apparently saying ‚ÄúHope there‚Äôs no cramps mate‚Äù to him at T2.

Unfortunately for Laidlow it went from bad to worse for him on the run as he was reduced to a walk but that shouldn‚Äôt detract from a thrilling finale up front as Sanders and Long produced a sprint finish which just went the way of the Canadian.

‚ÄúNot bad for a couple of duathletes hey!‚Äù said Sanders afterwards in reference to Laidlow‚Äôs comments that he‚Äôd beat them even without an advantage from the swim.

Meanwhile Laidlow kept going but didn‚Äôt cross the line until Gustav Iden in matchup #11. And fair play to him Long and Sanders who all embraced at the finish.

Results

Points: Team International 4.5 Team USA 3.5 Team Europe 1

Match 9 ‚Äì Magnus Ditlev vs. Rudy Von Berg vs. Max Neumann

Brilliant Challenge Roth winner Magnus Ditlev put down another marker with a demolition job here at the Collins Cup.

It was super close on the swim ‚Äì ‚ÄúI was really pleased with that‚Äù said Ditlev ‚Äì as Max Neumann held a fractional lead with Rudy Von Berg +4s and Ditlev at +7s.

But the great Dane‚Äôs power on the bike is in no doubt and it was a one-horse race from that point to claim maximum points as Von Berg who was a late withdrawal from this event last year took second.

Results

1. Magnus Ditlev (EUR) ‚Äì 3:13:31

2. Rudy Von Berg (USA) ‚Äì 3:20:51

3. Max Neumann (INT) ‚Äì 3:24:52

Points: Team Europe 6 Team USA 3 Team International 1

Match 10 ‚Äì Patrick Lange vs. Jason West vs. Aaron Royle

A great 22:56 swim from Aaron Royle proved pivotal in this one.

It put him 2:22 ahead of Patrick Lange (hit with a 10 seconds penalty for jumping a fraction early on his bike) and Jason West.

And full of confidence from his recent third at the PTO Canadian Open Royle was able to make it count.

‚ÄúI knew I had to swim hard and that I did ‚Äì but I knew there was no looking back from then on. And the feeling of being hunted down can play with your mind especially on the run.‚Äù

Results

1. Aaron Royle (INT) ‚Äì 3:19:42

2. Jason West (USA) ‚Äì 3:24:34

3. Patrick Lange (EUR) ‚Äì 3:26:07

Points: Team International 5.5 Team USA 2 Team Europe 1

Match 11 ‚Äì Gustav Iden vs. Matt Hanson vs. Jackson Laundry

Gustav Iden followed fellow Norwegian Kristian Blummenfelt in breaking the hour mark for the 18km run as his points officially meant Team Europe had retained the Collins Cup.

In truth that had been decided long before but it was another superb display by the reigning 70.3 World Champion.

Matt Hanson was just two seconds behind him after the swim but that soon ballooned while Jackson Laundry was a distant third throughout.

Results

1. Gustav Iden (EUR) ‚Äì 3:11:32

2. Matt Hanson (USA) ‚Äì 3:19:19

3. Jackson Laundry (INT) ‚Äì 3:32:49

Points: Team Europe 6 Team USA 3.5 Team International 1

Match 12 ‚Äì Daniel B√¶kkeg√•rd vs. Chris Leiferman vs. Braden Currie

Two wins for Norway in the men‚Äôs and two for Denmark too as Daniel B√¶kkeg√•rd followed in Magnus Ditlev‚Äôs footprints.

He led the swim in 24:05 with Braden Currie at +42s and Chris Leiferman ‚Äì who endured a difficult day ‚Äì at +2:49.

Such was the strength of the European team B√¶kkeg√•rd was ‚Äòonly‚Äô a Captains‚Äô Pick but he rounded off a dominant triumph for the defending champions in style.

Results

1. Daniel B√¶kkeg√•rd (EUR) ‚Äì 3:13:52

2. Braden Currie (INT) ‚Äì 3:21:41

3. Chris Leiferman (USA) ‚Äì 3:24:42

Bob Casey narrowly leads Republican challenger Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania‚Äôs U.S. Senate race with six months until the election a new Inquirer/New York Times/Siena College poll shows.

Casey leads McCormick 46% to 41% among Pennsylvania registered voters just inside the survey‚Äôs margin of error. An additional 13% of voters were undecided. The poll was conducted from April 28 to May 7.

Casey who has represented the state in the Senate since 2007 had a similar lead on McCormick in an April poll from Emerson College.

The race which the nonpartisan Cook Political Report says ‚Äúleans Democratic‚Äù is one of several that could determine which party controls the Senate.

Bob Casey is outperforming Joe Biden

While Casey and McCormick are running closely in the state Casey is also outrunning his party‚Äôs presidential nominee President Joe Biden.

Casey outruns President Joe Biden by 2 percentage points when voters are asked about a two-person race between Biden and former President Donald Trump. When third-party presidential candidates including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are included in the mix Casey outruns Biden by a much larger 10 points.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know a lot about Bob Casey but I haven‚Äôt heard anything bad about Bob Casey‚Äù said Charles Kestener 41 a registered independent from Allentown who plans to vote for Casey but not Biden.

Kestener a truck driver criticized Biden‚Äôs handling of the economy and the military withdrawal from Afghanistan. He said he would support Green Party candidate Jill Stein in the presidential race over either major party candidate.

Casey leads McCormick with women and voters who identify as independents as well as young voters and non-white voters two groups that have drifted away from Biden in the state.

‚ÄúPeople know the Casey family‚Äù said Eric Stern former deputy campaign manager for Sen. John Fetterman. ‚ÄúThey know Sen. Casey extremely well and even if their feelings about national Democrats gets colder ‚Ä¶ They don‚Äôt necessarily hold the senator responsible for their feelings on the economy or national issues or inflation.‚Äù

Still Stern said he expects the gap to shrink between Casey and Biden two longtime political allies. ‚ÄúThere just aren‚Äôt enough swing voters anymore. Even if Casey runs the best campaign in the world he‚Äôs not gonna outpace Biden by 10 points.‚Äù

Trump outruns McCormick in a head-to-head presidential matchup and pulls in similar support when voters are asked about third-party candidates.

GOP political consultant Vince Galko who worked on both of former Sen. Pat Toomey‚Äôs reelection campaigns said if McCormick can outrun Trump in more suburban areas where he currently trails Casey by a large margin that could pay dividends.

‚ÄúHe can go after independents and swing voters in the suburbs that Trump‚Äôs not gonna get‚Äù Galko said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got his military background and economic message so it doesn‚Äôt even have to be big numbers but a point and a half could be huge in the Philly suburbs.‚Äù

Biden and Trump remain unpopular candidates in the state with 55% of registered voters disapproving of Trump and 57% unhappy with Biden.

Casey is polling favorably with 49% of voters compared to Biden who is favorable among 41% of voters. McCormick and Trump are even on favorability with 41% and 42% of voters considering them favorable candidates.

Mike Mikus a Democratic political consultant who has worked on Senate campaigns in the state said 49% favorability is a good sign for Casey.

‚ÄúThose are really strong numbers in an environment like this for Democrats‚Äù Mikus said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna take a lot of money and effort to try to make Bob Casey an unfavorable figure in Pennsylvania That‚Äôs one of McCormick‚Äôs biggest challenges.‚Äù

McCormick remains relatively unknown by 34% of Pennsylvania voters

More Pennsylvanians view McCormick favorably (42%) than unfavorably (24%) but 34% either had not heard of him or had no opinion of him. That‚Äôs about 14 points higher than the 20% who did not know how they felt about Casey or said they had not heard of him.

It‚Äôs a sign that McCormick is still introducing himself to voters who may not remember him from the bruising 2022 GOP primary two years ago when even Trump was criticizing him.

And while Democrats have for months accused McCormick of being a carpetbagger who primarily lives in Connecticut it‚Äôs not clear by McCormick‚Äôs favorability numbers that those attacks have resonated.

It‚Äôs early in the campaign cycle and both campaigns are eventually expected to pour millions into ads to get their names and messages out in the state.

John Fetterman maintains support

Fetterman a Pennsylvania Democrat is not up for reelection but he‚Äôs frequently in the headlines for his boldly casual political style and staunch support for Israel.

The senator isn‚Äôt afraid to make waves and voters seem split on how they feel about that. Fetterman‚Äôs overall favorability rating was at 48% just 1 percentage point lower than Casey his quieter U.S. Senate counterpart. An additional 41% of registered voters had unfavorable views of Fetterman.

Fetterman a freshman senator is slightly better known than Casey with just 6% of voters saying they haven‚Äôt heard of him.

Stock Value: Purchased

Reasoning: The Steelers used their fourth-round draft pick to take a third offensive lineman in Mason McCormick. One could argue the sheer volume indicates how highly they value McCormick relative to other positions of need. They passed on some defensive backs to draft a player who has virtually no shot of playing this year. But perhaps they see him as a potential future starter for the long haul.

Odds are Mason McCormick begins his career as a backup. But he‚Äôll have ample opportunity to dictate or at least influence how things progress from there. The Steelers already tipped their hand in how they drafted him and what they said about him: they‚Äôre big fans.

You have to be a big fan of an offensive lineman to draft him in the fourth round after already drafting linemen in the first two rounds. After all the Steelers never did anything like that before in their history. But they seem to believe Mason McCormick could be a starter sooner or later. Perhaps sooner rather than later. General manager Omar Khan seemed to go out of his way to highlight next offseason. Both starting James Daniels and reserve Nate Herbig are pending unrestricted free agents. Could McCormick step into the starting lineup for Daniels by then? They seem open to it.

After all it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt have plenty of tape. He played something like 3400 snaps in college if my memory is correct. He‚Äôs older he‚Äôs mature he‚Äôs humble he‚Äôs loyal he‚Äôs dedicated. He‚Äôs the kind of offensive lineman that you want to have on your team. That‚Äôs why they drafted him even though the line room seemed pretty full already.

At the other guard spot is Isaac Seumalo who is on the wrong side of 30. Even if they were to end up re-signing Daniels Seumalo isn‚Äôt going to play forever either. But McCormick first has to prove himself on the field before any of this conversation matters. Yeah they liked him but now he has to justify it.

Still Mason McCormick seems like an easy player to root for. And in terms of immediacy he could at least challenge for the top interior reserve role. He played guard generally but is center-capable so he could theoretically make Herbig expendable.

As the season progresses Steelers players‚Äô stocks rise and fall. The nature of the evaluation differs with the time of year with in-season considerations being more often short-term. Considerations in the offseason often have broader implications particularly when players lose their jobs or the team signs someone. This time of year is full of transactions whether minor or major.

A bad game a new contract an injury a promotion‚Äîany number of things affect a player‚Äôs value. Think of it as a stock on the market based on speculation. You‚Äôll feel better about a player after a good game or worse after a bad one. Some stock updates are minor while others are likely to be quite drastic so bear in mind the degree. I‚Äôll do my best to explain the nature of that in the reasoning section of each column.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2toYXZlbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvc2VuYXRlLWNhbmRpZGF0ZS1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1tYWtlcy1zdG9wLWluLWNsaW50b24tY291bnR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Senate candidate Dave McCormick makes stop in Clinton County,"McELHATTAN ‚Äî U.S. Senate Candidate Dave McCormick recently visited Restless Oaks to meet with constituents.

At least that‚Äôs what the Pittsburgh Steelers‚Äô fourth-round draft pick credits for his own sense of loyalty.

An FCS football player out of the Missouri Valley Football Conference‚Äôs South Dakota State Jackrabbits McCormick faced the same challenges as any small-school prospect. No matter how well you dominate your competition you‚Äôre always asked who did you beat? Such questions often cap their potential to the middle rounds of the draft.

A lot of times NFL-worthy prospects from small schools must answer those questions in Bowl games and practices. Arguably fewer small-school players make it this far because those who have that talent enter the transfer portal. They end up changing schools where they can raise their profile. McCormick never did despite the opportunity to do so and he explained why.

‚ÄúYes I had offers. The temptation was not there‚Äù he told reporters on Friday via the team‚Äôs website. ‚ÄúSouth Dakota State gave so much to me and developed me into who I am now. Who am I to leave South Dakota State? They poured so much into me. I feel like they should be able to reap the benefits of what they helped create. Sure some money would be cool or whatever but it‚Äôs just ultimately my loyalties lie with the people that are good to me.‚Äù

Reporters asked him questions in the same vein after the draft and he gave the same answer. ‚ÄúI feel like in today‚Äôs world loyalty is kind of an afterthought‚Äù he said at the time via 93.7 The Fan. ‚ÄúSouth Dakota State did so much for me it was a no-brainer for me to be loyal to them.‚Äù

McCormick first arrived at South Dakota State in 2018 redshirting his first season as a zero-star prospect from Sioux Falls. He managed two starts the following season before the COVID-19 pandemic wiped out his redshirt sophomore year. In all he spent six years there logging comfortably over 3000 career snaps on the offensive line.

We‚Äôll see how loyalty influences McCormick‚Äôs relationship with the Pittsburgh Steelers moving forward. He has a chance to earn a starting job though not as a rookie. They drafted him after taking linemen in the first two rounds precisely for that reason. If he does crack the starting lineup will he show loyalty to the Steelers when he hits free agency?

That doesn‚Äôt mean taking a cheap contract because business is always a part of the equation. But for some more than others so are our core values. McCormick credits his family for the emphasis he puts on loyalty.

‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs just the way I was raised‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPeople that are good to you you should be great to them and give back to them. That‚Äôs just the way it‚Äôs always been for me.‚Äù

Loyalty. It‚Äôs an easy talk to talk but try walking it and most will fall on their face. McCormick stayed loyal to South Dakota State and it served him well to get this far."

(A screenshot from a McDonald's ad.) Chris Matyszczyk/screenshot

It's all about the money.

It's always about the money.

When one of your favorite brands begins to encourage you to use its app there's really only one reason -- to get you to buy its wares more often.

That's where the pandemic suited fast-food brands perfectly. People were stuck at home. They could use apps to get pick-up or delivery. For the likes of McDonald's and Chick-fil-A business did rather well.

You might wonder though what McDonald's is thinking now. I might tell you that it wants you to use its app for well please take a little saunter with me.

The burger chain's UK arm has just released an ad that may boggle minds and even stomachs.

It features a long-distance truck driver. It's a tough job. It requires a lot of sitting. It requires a lot of pining for your loved one who in this case is called Lorraine. It also apparently requires a lot of eating at McDonald's.

Here you see our trucker passes his time by singing -- just one song in fact. ""Coming Home"" by Leon Bridges. He also passes his time stopping at every conceivable McDonald's he can.

""Why would he do that?"" you might ask. Perhaps that's all that's open on his travels. Perhaps it's the sheer convenience and value that seduces him.

Or perhaps it's the fact that he feels an urgent need to use his app to rack up as many McDonald's MyRewards points as he can.

One or two people may fear for his health. All he seems to eat is more and more McDonald's. A lot of McDonald's.

The points are mounting at a precipitous pace. Could this truck driver have really eaten every breakfast lunch and dinner at the same place?

Could the people who approved this ad not have wondered that this doesn't set a healthy example for those who'd like to live a long time?

Why is he really doing this? It's here that McDonald's tries to turn on the charm. This truck driver you see has earned enough points to get himself a free McChicken sandwich.

Free always has its attractions. How lovely that he won't have to pay for this delicacy.

Oh but then there's a twist.

The lovely Lorraine is there to meet him at the door of what one presumes is their home. Our hero saunters into the kitchen clutching a gift for her behind his back.

You're already there aren't you? It's the McChicken Sandwich.

Also: McDonald's and Chick-fil-A both have a big problem. Only one has a solution

Yes our hero loves his Lorraine so much that he's stuffed his face for days and days just so that he can avoid paying $1.29 -- at least in the US -- for a gift to impress his Lorraine.

Oh it's all played as if this is something of a joke.

But how many on watching this ad might consider a few things?

One a fast-food brand encouraging its customers to constantly fill their gullets with rather unhealthy food may not be acting entirely responsible.

Two love may not revolve around money but there's still something entirely unloving about bringing a now-cold McChicken Sandwich back to your lover in order to inculcate your questionable eating habits into her life and tell her how much you care.

And three Lorraine is this really the right man for you?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYmlsbC1tdXJwaHktanIvYWZ0ZXItNTUteWVhcnMtbWNkb25hbGRzLWp1c3RtYWRlLWEtbG9uZy1hd2FpdGVkLWFubm91bmNlbWVudC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After 55 Years McDonald's Just Made a Long-Awaited Announcement,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/after-55-years-mcdonalds-justmade-a-long-awaited-announcement.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYmlsbC1tdXJwaHktanIvYWZ0ZXItNTUteWVhcnMtbWNkb25hbGRzLWp1c3RtYWRlLWEtbG9uZy1hd2FpdGVkLWFubm91bmNlbWVudC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9mb29kLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvbWNkb25hbGRzLWNoaWNrZW4tYmlnLW1hYy11bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzLzc4NjA3ODIwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's to test run chicken Big Mac in the US after popular UK trial,"The Big Mac is one of McDonald's signature items but the fast food chain is putting a new twist on it ‚Äì originating all the way from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.

McDonald's said their CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a recent earnings call that chicken ""continues to be a significant opportunity for us"" and remains a priority for the company.

""We've got some great global equities already in our McNuggets and with McChicken but we also have some equities in McCrispy and McSpicy that we think we've got an opportunity to do more with globally"" Kempczinski said.

McDonald's didn't say if the chicken Big Mac will be available nationwide but hinted the test run in Florida could springboard it to a menu near you.

""While not everything we test makes it on our U.S. menus we‚Äôll use this time to gather feedback from both customers and restaurant crew as we consider opportunities to offer more delicious options in the future"" the company said.

However fans of McDonald‚Äôs don‚Äôt have to worry because the popular fast-food restaurant will be returning to the same site in Mentor in the near future.

According to City of Mentor Planning Director Kathy Mitchell demolition of the building began Aug.12 and the building was gone by Aug 16.

The original McDonald‚Äôs building was constructed in 1983. The current owner is building a new McDonald‚Äôs restaurant in its place with the design of the building to be updated to reflect the brand‚Äôs current model while complimenting the style and character of recently approved buildings within the Reynolds Road corridor.

The site circulation will also be improved with expanded drive-thru lanes and safer access onto and off the site.

‚ÄúThese site and building upgrades are a definite enhancement to this busy corridor‚Äù Mitchell said.

Cost associated with the permit is $2.5 million and the contractor is listed as Fred Olivieri Construction Company.

Mentor Economic Director Kevin Malecek said the busy corridor on Reynolds Road is a popular area for businesses to invest in such as new facilities for Optima Dermatology and Rainforest Car Wash. Several McDonald‚Äôs have undergone similar updates such as ones in Willoughby Hills and Mayfield and the new facility on Reynolds Road will certainly add to the attraction of an already heavily-trafficked area he said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a popular landing spot for businesses and the ones that are established are helping bring up the vibrancy and are thinking of staying current with their customers in mind‚Äù Malecek said. ‚ÄúI think you will see continuous reinvestment and redevelopment along the corridor.‚Äù

Malecek said there are more than 175 restaurants in Mentor ranging from fast food to high end establishments and from national chains to locally owned businesses. He added the city has shown it will support additional restaurants coming in recently such as Bibibop."

The trial is evaluating the investigational coformulation of vibostolimab an anti-TIGIT antibody and pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA¬Æ) Merck‚Äôs anti-PD-1 therapy compared to KEYTRUDA alone as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Stage IIB-IV). At a pre-planned analysis data showed that the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS) met the pre-specified futility criteria. A higher rate of discontinuation of all adjuvant therapy by patients in the coformulation arm versus the KEYTRUDA-only arm primarily due to immune-mediated adverse experiences rendered it highly unlikely that the trial could achieve a statistically significant improvement in RFS. Based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Merck is unblinding the study and recommends that patients receiving the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation be offered the option to be treated with KEYTRUDA monotherapy. Data analysis from this study is ongoing. Results will be shared with the scientific community and communicated to regulatory agencies.

‚Äú Through our clinical development program we continue to ask the tough questions in an effort to fully explore the potential of novel coformulations and combinations that build on the foundation of KEYTRUDA with a goal to improve upon current standards of care and help even more patients with cancer‚Äù said Dr. Marjorie Green senior vice president and head of oncology global clinical development Merck Research Laboratories. ‚Äú We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation and will leverage insights from this trial as we rapidly advance our diverse pipeline of novel mechanisms including further study of this coformulation in lung cancer.‚Äù

Merck is committed to the development of new treatment options for patients with melanoma including in earlier stages of disease which build upon the current standard of care. The program includes the ongoing Phase 3 V940-001 study in collaboration with Moderna evaluating V940 (mRNA-4157) an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy (INT) in combination with KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment in patients with resected high-risk (Stage IIB-IV) melanoma.

In the U.S. KEYTRUDA has two approved indications in melanoma: for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB IIC or III melanoma following complete resection.

Vibostolimab is Merck‚Äôs investigational anti-TIGIT antibody that restores antitumor activity by blocking the TIGIT receptor from binding to its ligands (CD112 and CD155) thereby activating T lymphocytes that help destroy tumor cells. Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating the safety and efficacy of the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation alone and in combination with other agents in over 3000 patients.

Ongoing Phase 3 studies evaluating the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation in lung cancer which are routinely monitored by external data monitoring committees include KeyVibe-003 KeyVibe-006 KeyVibe-007 and KeyVibe-008. Interim external data monitoring committee safety reviews have not resulted in any safety-related study modifications to date. No changes to these studies are anticipated based on the KeyVibe-010 findings.

About KeyVibe-010

KeyVibe-010 is a randomized double-blind active comparator-controlled Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05665595) evaluating a coformulation of vibostolimab and pembrolizumab (MK-7684A) versus KEYTRUDA alone as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected high-risk Stage IIB-IV melanoma. The trial‚Äôs primary endpoint is RFS. Key secondary endpoints include distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS). The study enrolled 1594 patients who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive:

Vibostolimab/pembrolizumab coformulation (pembrolizumab 200 mg/20 mL and vibostolimab 200 mg intravenously [IV] every 3 three weeks [Q3W] for up to 17 cycles); or

Pembrolizumab (adult patients receive 200 mg and adolescent patients ‚â•40 kg receive 2 mg/kg [up to a maximum of 200 mg] IV Q3W for up to 17 cycles).

About melanoma

Melanoma the most serious form of skin cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The rates of melanoma have been rising over the past few decades with more than 330000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2022. In the U.S. skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed and melanoma accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA

Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1 blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway thereby removing inhibition of the immune response potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions which may be severe or fatal can occur in any organ system or tissue can affect more than one body system simultaneously and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti‚ÄìPD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes creatinine and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting monitor blood cortisol at baseline prior to surgery and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies including infection. Institute medical management promptly including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including fatal (0.1%) Grade 4 (0.3%) Grade 3 (0.9%) and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) acute and chronic GVHD hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti‚ÄìPD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti‚ÄìPD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti‚ÄìPD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

The need-to-know this morning

AC Immune has sold global licensing rights to an experimental immunotherapy for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease to the Japanese drugmaker Takeda. AC Immune received $100 million from Takeda for the therapy called ACI-24.060 and is eligible for another $2.1 billion in future payments.

Merck reported negative results from an interim analysis of a Phase 3 study involving the use of its experimental anti-TIGIT antibody as an adjuvant treatment for patients with high-risk melanoma.

Cancer drug developer OnKure is going public via a reverse merger with Reneo Pharma.

AI might not yet help develop ‚Äòn-of-1‚Äô treatments

Can AI be used to help create ‚Äún-of-1‚Äù treatments for the rarest of genetic diseases? The jury‚Äôs still out a new study suggests.

There‚Äôs been a wave of antisense oligonucleotide medications designed specifically to target the single mutation causing a patient‚Äôs symptoms. This is a compelling but time- and cost-prohibitive approach for most companies which has led some like Creyon Bio to turn to artificial intelligence as a way to speed along the process.

Last week Creyon said it successfully dosed a patient with a custom treatment that showed some signs of efficacy. What‚Äôs less clear however is whether machine learning helped make the drug faster or safer STAT‚Äôs Jason Mast writes. Creyon said initially it would use AI to create the new medicine within seven months; instead it took just over a year which is no better than other n-of-1 approaches. Milasen the first bespoke drug took 10 months to develop. And Creyon‚Äôs drug didn‚Äôt cost ‚Äúappreciably less‚Äù than other n-of-1 medicines which run over $1 million to create.

The FDA‚Äôs hands-off stance with drug-device combos

Drugmakers have long asked the FDA for clearer guidelines on how to list patents in a special registry called the Orange Book. This is important because it helps branded drugmakers inform generic competitors about their intellectual property. However regulators haven‚Äôt offered the necessary guidance for drug-and-device combination products like inhalers and auto-injectors STAT‚Äôs Ed Silverman writes. This is frustrating for industry players and patient advocates alike.

Recently the FTC has stepped in warning companies about improper patent listings in the Orange Book and taking legal action against those that try and extend their monopolies.

‚ÄúThe FDA needs to show some leadership and say which stuff won‚Äôt go in the Orange Book but instead they have been flip-flopping for years‚Äù the leader of a nonprofit that focuses on pharmaceutical patent issues told STAT. ‚ÄúThere is just too much uncertainty that hasn‚Äôt been cleared up.‚Äù

We now know Tome‚Äôs gene editing target

From STAT‚Äôs Jason Mast: For all the hype surrounding CRISPR the tool has been largely effective at knocking out genes or making small edits. So when two scientists emerged a couple years ago touting technology capable of inserting large genes into human cells without doing major damage to the DNA investors agreed to pour over $200 million to try to make it a reality.

That round for Tome Biosciences was announced in December. On Friday at a major gene therapy conference CEO Rahul Kakkar laid out for the first time how the company plans to use the technology: initially to treat a rare disease called phenylketonuria and to design a natural killer cell therapy heavily engineered to safely treat autoimmune diseases. Beyond that are plans to make a heart disease treatment and treatments for rare diseases homocystinuria and hemochromatosis.

The company will of course have competition. Tessera has also showed animal data for treating phenylketonuria with a gene editing system for changing individual letters. And Prime Medicine has a very similar technology for large gene insertion though it has yet to reveal much detail on specific diseases.

A CRISPR approach did not cure HIV

An effort to use CRISPR editing to excise HIV from patient genomes did not work. A Phase 1 trial from Excision Therapeutics administered a CRISPR-based therapy to five patients with HIV. Researchers then took three of these patients off of conventional antiviral treatment with hopes that they wouldn‚Äôt need to resume daily medication. But despite the CRISPR treatment virus levels rebounded quickly.

This is likely because the gene editing approach wasn‚Äôt efficient enough STAT‚Äôs Jason Mast writes. Excision used an adeno-associated virus to distribute the gene editing tool throughout the body ‚Äî and AAVs don‚Äôt reach all cells. So even if the virus was excised from part of the body it‚Äôs likely it lingered elsewhere.

But there were signs of hope: One patient‚Äôs infection didn‚Äôt rebound for about four months after stopping antivirals whereas typically it comes back after three or four weeks. This suggests that CRISPR editing might ultimately be coupled with other approaches to cure HIV.

Maze gets another chance to partner on Pompe drug

Last year Sanofi was set to pay $150 million in cash and stock to license an experimental Pompe disease treatment made by Maze Therapeutics ‚Äî but the FTC blocked the deal and it fell through. Now Maze has partnered with Japanese drugmaker Shionogi to further develop MZE001 again with $150 million up front STAT‚Äôs Andrew Joseph writes.

Sanofi already sells two intravenous infusions for Pompe which caused concern for regulators who said an acquisition would extend Sanofi‚Äôs monopoly in the disease and dissuade competitors from entering the space. The French drugmaker walked away from the deal without personally informing the company: CEO Jason Coloma told STAT last year that he was ‚Äúpersonally disappointed‚Äù in the Sanofi deal falling through.

‚ÄúShionogi has a track record of developing and delivering innovative medicines to patients worldwide and we‚Äôre confident they are the right partner to continue to advance MZE001 through clinical trials so that it may reach patients with this life-threatening condition as soon as possible‚Äù Coloma said in a statement.

Credit: Merck & Co and its affiliates.

US pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc (MSD) has discontinued a Phase III trial investigating a co-formulation of vibostolimab and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Stage IIB-IV).

The decision to cancel the KeyVibe-010 trial follows a pre-planned analysis indicating that the study‚Äôs primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS) was unlikely to be met.

The randomised active comparator-controlled study was designed to compare vibostolimab with pembrolizumab against Keytruda alone.

It enrolled 1594 subjects who were randomised at a 1:1 ratio to receive either the vibostolimab/pembrolizumab coformulation or pembrolizumab monotherapy.

Interim analysis showed that the coformulation arm met the pre-defined futility criteria for RFS.

In addition more patients in the coformulation arm discontinued the all-adjuvant therapy than those in the Keytruda-only arm.

MSD attributed the discontinuation mainly to immune-mediated adverse events which made it ‚Äòhighly unlikely‚Äô for the trial to achieve a statistically significant improvement in RFS.

Following the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Merck is unblinding the trial.

The company said it would continue to analyse data from the study and share the results with regulatory agencies in due course.

Merck Research Laboratories global clinical development oncology head and senior vice-president Dr Marjorie Green said: ‚ÄúThrough our clinical development programme we continue to ask the tough questions in an effort to fully explore the potential of novel coformulations and combinations that build on the foundation of Keytruda with a goal to improve upon current standards of care and help even more patients with cancer.

‚ÄúWe are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation and will leverage insights from this trial as we rapidly advance our diverse pipeline of novel mechanisms including further study of this co-formulation in lung cancer.‚Äù

MSD recently reported that its Phase III KEYNOTE-B21 trial of Keytruda plus chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer did not meet its primary endpoint."

At the time of his ban from Meta's platforms Tate had amassed over 4.7 million followers on Instagram.

Bans from Facebook and Instagram mean the former kickboxer turned multimillionaire influencer is now de-platformed from the big three social media platforms. He was banned from Twitter in 2016 after stating women should ""bear responsibility"" for being sexually assaulted. Meta banned Tate for violating its policies on ‚Äúdangerous organizations and individuals"" The Guardian confirmed.

Tate's videos ‚Äî which are cartoonishly misogynistic ‚Äîamassed a large amount of attention this summer due to their controversial and over-the-top nature and their ubiquity. Tate's questionable source of income appears to involve inducing customers at his ""Hustler's University"" business to create social media accounts clipping short vignettes from Tate's podcast and interview appearances and dispersing them to as many people as possible.

What appeared to have been Tate's official Tiktok account has been banned for quite some time now but his various fan accounts on TikTok have hundreds of thousands of followers. The #andrewtate hashtag alone has 13.4 billion views on Tiktok. A spokesperson with Tiktok told The Guardian that the platform has been ""removing violative videos and accounts for weeks and welcome[s] the news that other platforms are also taking action against this individual.""

In a statement to The Guardian Tate told the outlet that most of his videos are parody and that ""Internet sensationalism has purported the idea that I'm anti-women when nothing could be further from the truth."" Tate appeared with popular Twitch streamer Adin Ross and spoke about the claims further. He stated that everything said about him was a false narrative created by people who dislike him.

""What they've done is found all the little clips across six years of content a total of three or four minutes and are trying to make it look like I'm out there trying to hate on women when I'm the one out here donating to women trying to prove that my influence has an effect and that I need to be very very careful with it"" Tate said on Ross' stream. ""It's a truly false narrative."" Tate has so far been unapologetic about the many controversial statements that he claims are being used to construct this supposedly false narrative.

The UK advocacy group Hope Not Hate told the BBC that Tate is a ‚Äúdangerous misogynist‚Äù and called on more social media companies to deplatform him. Joe Mulhall director of research at the group told the BBC that ""Mr. Tate poses a genuine threat to young men radicalizing them towards extremism misogyny racism and homophobia.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwbG9hZHZyLmNvbS96dWNrZXJiZXJnLW1ldGEtYXZhdGFycy1ob3Jpem9uLXdvcmxkcy1ncmFwaGljcy10ZWFzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zuckerberg Teases Meta Avatars & Horizon Worlds Graphics Updates,"Mark Zuckerberg is teasing significant graphics updates for Meta Avatars and Horizon Worlds.

Meta Avatars are used in the company‚Äôs Horizon suite of social VR apps and available to Quest developers via an SDK. Horizon Worlds works similarly to Rec Room allowing users to create their own social experiences inside VR by using controllers to place & manipulate shapes and using a visual scripting system to add dynamic functionality. Because these platforms support user created worlds and run on mobile chips the graphical fidelity achievable is limited. VRChat worlds are premade in Unity on desktop with most lighting ‚Äúbaked in‚Äù by a powerful PC ‚Äì and the most impressive worlds aren‚Äôt accessible to Quest users at all.

A Horizon Worlds screenshot shared by the Meta CEO on Tuesday announcing the platform launching in France & Spain didn‚Äôt go down well on Twitter and other social media platforms. The crude graphic fidelity of both the avatar and the world shown led to widespread ridicule.

Zuckerberg responded to this ridicule on Friday with a new image teasing graphical updates ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù:

Major updates to Horizon and avatar graphics coming soon. I‚Äôll share more at Connect. Also I know the photo I posted earlier this week was pretty basic ‚Äî it was taken very quickly to celebrate a launch. The graphics in Horizon are capable of much more ‚Äî even on headsets ‚Äî and Horizon is improving very quickly.

The ‚Äúeven on headsets‚Äù qualifier seems to refer to Meta‚Äôs intention to launch Horizon on the web and mobile platforms later this year. Barrett Meeker who leads Horizon‚Äôs visual fidelity improvement project tweeted to confirm the graphics shown depict what‚Äôs planned for Quest 2. What makes even a graphically simplistic avatar feel like another person in VR is how the system translates the person‚Äôs head and hand tracking data into real-time animation and the still images Zuckerberg shared don‚Äôt convey that.

Meta Avatars before & after the upcoming graphics update

Graphical improvements to Horizon Worlds will come as a welcome update for its user base but increasing the graphical realism of VR avatars can have significant tradeoffs. Visually detailed features without detailed tracked motion can make an avatar feel like a lifeless mannequin. Meta plans to introduce eye tracking and face tracking in Quest Pro this year but Quest 2 lacks these sensors.

Zuckerberg said Meta will share more at Connect the company‚Äôs annual AR/VR conference. The date hasn‚Äôt been announced yet but it‚Äôs also where we‚Äôll likely hear more about the launch of Quest Pro and Horizon‚Äôs web & mobile versions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL2FuZHJldy10YXRlLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS1pbmZsdWVuY2VyLWZvcm1lci1yZWFsaXR5LXR2LXN0YXItYmFubmVkLWZyb20tZmFjZWJvb2staW5zdGFncmFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Andrew Tate - social media influencer former reality TV star - banned from Facebook Instagram,"Controversial social media influencer and former reality TV star Andrew Tate was banned from Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram on Friday.

Tate 35 was banned due to violations of Meta‚Äôs policies on dangerous organizations and individuals according to the BBC. Before he was banned Tate had over 4.7 million followers on his Instagram account @cobratate.

The former kickboxing champion discussed the ban with popular Twitch streamer Adin Ross.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm quite understanding of their position‚Äù Tate said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a big loss for me. It‚Äôs not something I use too often.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm kind of relieved because the real world is such a beautiful place. The less things on my phone and it‚Äôs just one less thing I have to look at. I‚Äôll just get in my supercar and go for a drive.‚Äù

Tate told the Twitch streamer he doesn‚Äôt know why he was banned from the Meta platforms. But went on to say that he has ‚Äúgood people on the case‚Äù and that he trusts ‚ÄúDue process.‚Äù

Tate‚Äôs first rise into the limelight came when he appeared as a contestant on the UK version of ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù in 2016.

He was kicked from the show after a video emerged of him allegedly attacking a woman. Tate‚Äôs stance on the video is that it was edited and ‚Äúa total lie trying to make me look bad‚Äù as reported by the BBC.

In 2017 during the height of the Harvey Weinstein allegations Tate was suspended by Twitter for saying that women should ‚Äúbear responsibility‚Äù for being sexually assaulted.

Tate‚Äôs popularity grew amid outlandish comments about women‚Äôs intelligence saying they‚Äôre ‚Äúintrinsically lazy‚Äù and is a strong proponent that men should have ‚Äúauthority‚Äù over a woman when in a relationship.

Tate has a Youtube channel under the name ‚ÄúTateSpeech‚Äù. TateSpeech/YouTube

CBS News reported that an account associated with Tate was permanently banned from TikTok as the company ramps up its efforts to remove videos of Tate‚Äôs hateful ideologies. His videos are being uploaded by various accounts not directly associated with Tate with the #andrewtate having more than 13 billion views on TikTok.

He posted an image of the Zuckerberg avatar standing in front of the Eiffel Tower.

Mocking his photo people started sharing memes on Twitter. For example one Twitter user shared an image saying ""Second Life 2007 Metaverse 2022"".

Another user compared Zuckerberg's photo with the video game 1996's Quake.

Here's another meme created around Zuckerberg's photo on Facebook.

On Friday Zuckerberg went on Instagram to introduce his new avatar. In the post he said that the earlier photo posted on Facebook was very basic and said it was done in a hurry to announce the France and Spain launch.

Meta has stated that Tate was deplatformed under their rules regarding dangerous individuals and groups. No further comments on the action has been released by the company.

Tate is familiar with this fate

Tate was removed from Twitter in 2017 after he said that women who are raped ‚Äúbare some responsibility‚Äù for their attack. This incident shows that Tate‚Äôs misogyny can be traced back years and is not a new aspect of his online shtick.

How did Andrew Tate make his money?

The former-kick boxer gained his wealth through the sex work industry setting up some of his romantic partners on a webcam to talk to men online. While women are responsible for his wealth he denigrates the entire gender by drawing strict lines delineating what women are and are unable to do. He has also made comments that physical abuse may be needed to punish women who disobey their man.

Before his current rise to fame Andrew Tate was a known supporter of the British far right and a supporter of Brexit.

‚ÄúIf I were in charge of Brexit I would send them a letter saying here is how much money you are going to get from England with a big fat zero‚Äù said Tate while commenting on the negotiations with the European Union.

He then goes onto say that leaders in England are ‚Äúpussies‚Äù because they won‚Äôt stand up and pass a law stating that no laws are going to change as the UK leaves the EU.

‚ÄúWe are no longer in the European Union because there are a whole bunch of laws that everyone is arguing about the Ireland thing fishing all this bullshit [‚Ä¶]. I am going to pass a law now that everything stays the same until it is changed. Done! No money All laws stay the same. [‚Ä¶] You got a problem Europe? Fuck off we are going to do trade with Donald Trump.‚Äù

His comments show a how uneducated he is on the difficulties of Brexit specifically the dangerous and volatile situation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

On the trade front Tate should be aware that the United Kingdom including Northern Ireland Scotland and Wales which Tate neglects to mention was $2.7 trillion in 2020 while that of the European Union hit more than $17 trillion.

Additionally to say that the country will ‚Äúdo trade with Donald Trump‚Äù demonstrates a blatant misunderstanding of trade relations work and the associated complexities.

Andrew Tate has responded to his banning from Facebook and Instagram for misogynism. He told the Daily Mail he was ""playing a comedic character"" https://t.co/BzB88ni2In ‚Äî Zoe Kleinman (@zsk) August 20 2022

Who else has been banned by Meta?

Andrew Tate is one of many right-wing figures to be removed from Meta‚Äôs platforms.

InfoWars founder Alex Jones was banned from Facebook YouTube Twitter and all other major social media companies in 2018. The platforms cited hate speech spreading misinformation and child endangerment.

Others including known Nazi Milo Yiannopoulos have also been removed from Meta platforms as well as Paul Joseph Watson Paul Nehlen Laura Loomer and Louis Farrakhan.

Right-wing commentators often argue that their speech is under attack but this does not stop them from trying to infringe on the rights to expressive freedoms of others. They also neglect the fact that the platforms from which they are being banned are private entities which allow them all the power under the law to determine what content they chose to have featured."

The early belief is that Thibodeaux's injury is not severe.

""I'm all right. I'm good"" Thibodeaux said leaving the stadium under his own power with only a slight limp.

""We're good. Good news"" he added later.

Thibodeaux will undergo further tests on Monday. That will ultimately determine how much time he will have to miss.

It didn't look promising when the injury happened given the way Thibodeaux was hit and his reaction. He went down after getting cut-blocked by Bengals tight end Thaddeus Moss in the second quarter and immediately grabbed at his right knee.

Trainers and doctors attended to Thibodeaux near the 20-yard line. The cart came out for Thibodeaux but he got up and walked right past it. The rookie went into the blue medical tent before emerging with a smile and some laughs. He walked the length of the sideline before heading inside with a trainer.

""I can't answer [that anything severe is ruled out] yet"" coach Brian Daboll said. ""They'll be doing tests [Sunday night] MRIs and stuff like that and get a better feel for it in morning. You hope not. Don't have an answer for that yet.""

Thibodeaux seemed to be taking an optimistic approach. He relayed to teammates after the Giants' 25-22 preseason win over the Cincinnati Bengals that it wasn't something that would ruin his rookie season.

Thibodeaux gave off a positive impression.

""He's always in good spirits. I hope he's OK. I talked to him. He's walking on it. Said he was fine"" defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence said. ""Probably something that will just take time to heal a little bit. I don't really know what it is. I'm not a doctor.""

Thibodeaux was the fifth overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft out of the University of Oregon. He was having a strong summer and had a quarterback pressure earlier in Sunday's contest.

The Giants are expecting big things from Thibodeaux this season. He has been working with the first-string defense since the start of OTAs in the spring.

Thibodeaux had 19.0 sacks in 30 career games at Oregon. He went into last season as the potential No. 1 overall prospect in college football.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9nYWxsZXJpZXMvQVVOMkRMNkZKNUVIVkYySkFRQUFLRVBGQkkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NFL Preseason: New York Giants vs. Cincinnati Bengals - nj.com,"35 / 35

Dear Gridlock Sam

The exit off the Long Island Expressway at Van Dam St. has people constantly pushing their way into the people waiting in the proper lanes. They even get all the way up to the exit and intimidate to get in. Something has to be done; I think there should be a traffic camera at these exits to take photos and issue tickets similar to red light cameras and speed and bus lane cameras.

Joe

Dear Joe

I hate ‚Äúcheaters.‚Äù That‚Äôs what I call drivers who go to the very end of a long line of cars and cross over the channelization (hatched lines). The Van Dam exit is one of the worst locations in the city because it is the last exit before the toll at the Queens Midtown Tunnel.

Once congestion pricing goes into effect there will no longer be an incentive for drivers to hop off at Van Dam unless they have a local destination. Until then I‚Äôve asked NYPD to enforce the rule but even then I don‚Äôt see the problem eliminated. The legislation for cameras doesn‚Äôt extend to crossing channelization but maybe it should. Readers?

It launches on February 1 2022 and we interviewed an MGM representative to get all the details. Let‚Äôs take a look.

New MGM Rewards Program Details

According to an MGM official the M life program will be rebranded as MGM Rewards because guests often failed to make the connection between ‚ÄúM life‚Äù and ‚ÄúMGM.‚Äù This is far from the most exciting news however as the revamped program will be offering far more enticing benefits to compete with fellow casino loyalty programs.

The 5 existing tiers of status will remain the same:

Sapphire (Up to 19999 Tier Credits)

(Up to 19999 Tier Credits) Pearl (20000 Tier Credits)

(20000 Tier Credits) Gold (75000 Tier Credits)

(75000 Tier Credits) Platinum (200000 Tier Credits)

(200000 Tier Credits) Noir (Invitation only)

However new perks will be launching to help bring the MGM Rewards program into a far more competitive alignment with programs such as Caesars Rewards.

In addition to elite status updates MGM Rewards will change the way you earn points. Specifically from February 1 2022 onward nearly all gaming and non-gaming spending will earn you MGM Rewards Points. Previously these points were limited to gaming and co-branded credit card spend.

However bear in mind that along with these changes MGM Rewards will be slashing the ability to earn elite status for non-gaming spend. When this new program launches members will earn just 4 Tier Credits per non-gaming dollar spent versus the current 25 Tier Credits per dollar they currently earn with M life.

Pearl Elite Status Changes

As the lowest earned status Pearl hasn‚Äôt historically awarded its members much. The new program offers some exciting changes however:

No expiration of points

Free concert tickets

This is in addition to existing benefits such as free self-parking and discounted room rates.

Hot Tip: Are you active duty or a veteran? Enjoy free Pearl status for life with MGM‚Äôs MVP M life Rewards Card.

Gold Elite Status Changes

Most of us here probably have M life‚Äôs Gold elite status thanks to its reciprocal partnership with World of Hyatt (and if you don‚Äôt you should). Although free valet parking has been nice the lack of waived resort fees as offered to Caesars Diamond members has driven away business. Clearly MGM has noticed this with these revised benefits:

Waived resort fees on up to 2 rooms

$100 celebration dinner (for eligible members)

Tier appreciation events

Although room rates in Las Vegas can be ridiculously cheap the $45+/night resort fee stacked on stop can quickly turn a cheap weekend getaway into a costly event. MGM has done one better than Caesars here and doubled the number of rooms you can get with waived resort fees ‚Äî meaning you and all your friends can head out and party for less than $25 per night.

And although at first blush the celebration dinner looks like it‚Äôs there to compete with Caesars‚Äô be aware that the $100 credit is only for those who‚Äôve acquired the actual Tier Credits; those who‚Äôve matched over do not qualify.

Platinum Elite Status Changes

$200 celebration dinner (for eligible members)

$600 air travel credit to Las Vegas (for eligible members)

Advanced suite upgrades (up to 3 nights)

4 p.m. late checkout

NOIR Elite Status Changes

$500 celebration dinner (for eligible members)

$1200 air travel credit to Las Vegas (for eligible members)

Keep in mind that the full breakdown of benefits hasn‚Äôt been released. MGM will be giving a broader breakdown when the MGM Rewards program launches on February 1 2022.

What About World of Hyatt?

According to the MGM representative to whom we spoke ‚ÄúMembers can continue to redeem World of Hyatt points for stays at all Las Vegas MGM Rewards destinations and MGM Rewards will continue to match World of Hyatt tier status under the new program as we do today with M life Rewards.‚Äù

This is excellent news for World of Hyatt loyalists and not just those who want to visit Vegas. Why? Because the reciprocal partnership with MGM means that you‚Äôll earn elite night credits on all MGM Resorts stays. At ~$65 per night this was still a decent and somewhat cheap way to earn World of Hyatt‚Äôs top-tier elite status.

But with resort fees waived ‚Äî well Vegas has just become the easiest and cheapest way to earn Globalist status.

Room rates in Las Vegas tend to fluctuate up and down pretty drastically on weekend versus non-weekend stays. The $22 rate above for example was on a Thursday night. But let‚Äôs say for the sake of argument that you were able to find yourself enough eligible weeknights at a $22 rate to earn yourself Globalist status.

How much would that take?

Earning World of Hyatt Globalist status takes 60 nights 50000 bonus points or 20 meetings hosted. In this case paying $22 per night would mean it‚Äôll cost you just $1320 to earn top-tier status. That‚Äôs ridiculously cheap especially for a status that grants you benefits such as complimentary breakfast suite upgrades and 4 p.m. checkout.

Final Thoughts

Look there‚Äôs no doubt that MGM has slashed the ability to earn elite status by dropping your earn rate on non-gaming spend from 25 Tier Credits down to 4 Tier Credits per dollar. However for those of us who rely on matches and partnerships to earn elite status the revamped MGM Rewards program is a huge boon.

This is especially true thanks to the industry-leading waived resort fees benefit which means that not only will Vegas (and elsewhere) be cheap for you World of Hyatt‚Äôs Globalist elite status just became much easier to reach.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1zdHJpcC1iaWctY2hhbmdlcy1uZXctY2FzaW5vLW5iYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Could Change the Las Vegas Strip Forever (In a Good Way),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/las-vegas-strip-big-changes-new-casino-nba on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1zdHJpcC1iaWctY2hhbmdlcy1uZXctY2FzaW5vLW5iYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hc2dhbS5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvbWdtLWNoaW5hLW5hbWVzLXBhbnN5LWhvLWFzLW1hbmFnaW5nLWRpcmVjdG9yLWFuZC0xNS1zaGFyZWhvbGRlci1pbi1tYWNhdS1jb25jZXNzaW9uLWhvbGRpbmctZW50aXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MGM China names Pansy Ho as Managing Director and 15% shareholder in Macau concession holding entity,"MGM China has announced a new Contribution and Share Subscription Agreement that will see its Co-Chairperson and Managing Director Pansy Ho named 15% shareholder and Managing Director of the company that holds its Macau gaming concession MGM Grand Paradise.

Under the agreement MGM China will inject MOP$4.8 billion (US$594 million) into MGM Grand Paradise ‚Äì which will tender for a new gaming concession ‚Äì in order to meet a requirement under Macau‚Äôs revised gaming law for concessionaires to maintain a minimum capital requirement of MOP$5 billion (US$618 million).

MGM Grand Paradise will then issue and allot 4070000 Class A Subscribed Shares and 730000 Class B Subscribed Shares to MGM China which will in turn transfer those 730000 Class B Subscribed Shares to Ms Ho for MOP$1.

Upon completion of the share issue and transfer MGM China will hold 84.6% of the voting rights in MGM Grand Paradise with Ms Ho holding 15.0% and parent firm MGM Resorts International 0.4%.

This would bring the company in line with another stipulation of the new gaming law which provides that management of concessionaires shall be delegated to a Managing Director who ‚Äúshall be a permanent resident of the Macau SAR and shall hold at least 15% of the capital stock of the concessionaire.‚Äù

In a Sunday filing MGM China said ‚ÄúUpon the successful outcome of the Tender additional duties and obligations will be imposed on Ms Pansy Ho pursuant to the delegation of authority to her as Managing Director from the MGM Grand Paradise‚Äôs board of directors.

‚ÄúIt is conditionally agreed that Ms Pansy Ho will serve as the Managing Director of MGM Grand Paradise for the same term as the Concession Term in consideration of the remuneration and incentive payments set out in the Services Agreement entered into between Ms Pansy Ho and MGM Grand Paradise.‚Äù

Ho who currently holds a 22.49% stake in MGM China will be remunerated for taking on the Managing Director role to the tune of US$8 million per year as well as incentive payments paid on a sliding scale depending on the company‚Äôs Adjusted EBITDA earnings each year to a maximum of US$95 million over the 10-year concession period.

The company said it expects the final award of new gaming concessions will be announced by the Macau government in November.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1pcy10aGUtd29ybGQtZ2FtYmxpbmctY2FwaXRhbC1hZ2Fpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas Is the World Gambling Capital Again,"Las Vegas is on track for a record year and is once again the king of gambling.

In reality the bill will unlikely achieve any of these objectives. Instead it could precipitate important distortions in domestic and international markets that lead to inefficiency waste and political dysfunction.

Congress and the Biden administration‚Äôs bid to subsidize the U.S. semiconductor industry has been unnecessary. The industry is healthy  possessing strong capabilities in most supply-chain segments constantly achieving increases in real output and capital expenditures and accounting for 39% of global value-added the largest share among all countries.

Pro-subsidy policymakers and interest groups are quick to point out that the U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing has declined from 37% in 1990 to 12% today yet U.S. manufacturing capacity increased from 2 million to 3 million wafers (disc-shaped slices of silicon containing dozens of chips) produced per month between 2000 and 2018 ‚Äî and close to half of those companies‚Äô wafer capacity is in the United States.

Where the United States is lacking ‚Äî primarily in the ‚Äúfoundry‚Äù segment which concerns third party-owned production facilities or ‚Äúfabs‚Äù that manufacture chips for companies without such in-house capabilities ‚Äî it can rely on friendly longstanding allies and trading partners including South Korea and Taiwan. Certainly this comes with some risks. But insofar as companies should diversify their operations to hedge against these risks they are large and profitable enough to not need government handouts for these purposes.

Moreover there are sound economic and geopolitical reasons for them to invest in the United States. Indeed Intel TSMC and Samsung confirmed investments in U.S. facilities worth more than $69 billion and began construction before the CHIPS Act was passed in Congress.

Not only are these subsidies unnecessary they could induce distortions in domestic and international markets that lead to decreased production less innovation and political dysfunction at home and abroad. As has been evident whenever U.S. policymakers have experimented with industrial policies beneficiary firms are seldom the most competitive or innovative ‚Äî and experts are already cautioning that firms like Intel may follow this path.

Moreover broad subsidization of the industry ‚Äî not addressing real market failures in next-generation semiconductors or gaps in national security-related ones ‚Äî may lead to underinvestment in bleeding-edge or specialized technologies including crowding out private investments. Subsidies will also likely benefit politically influential firms such as those that lobbied for the CHIPS Act making it less likely that policymakers would pull the plug on investments that prove inefficient or counterproductive.

Worse semiconductor companies worldwide are already anticipating an end to COVID-19-induced shortages as soon as next year. In fact because of lagging demand for consumer electronics and hoarding by chip-consuming firms there could be an oversupply of chips soon.

Given the industry‚Äôs proclivity to ‚Äú boom and bust ‚Äù cycles such a scenario would precipitate reduced revenues and idled production lines. Indeed firms like SK Hynix and Micron Technology are weighing cuts to capital expenditures for 2023.

By funding increased production U.S. subsidies would contribute to this oversupply and its adverse consequences. Moreover given the current global race to subsidize semiconductor production such adverse conditions could pressure countries to protect struggling domestic manufacturers from foreign competition through tariffs. Both foreign and U.S. trade restrictions would impose billions of dollars in costs to consumers and chip-consuming firms through higher prices and shortages ‚Äî as occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. Trade disputes would likely involve U.S. allies subsidizing their domestic industries thereby proving to be geopolitically costly.

Despite these pitfalls some may consider self-reliance in semiconductor production to be a worthwhile objective. But as a recent Nikkei Asia article noted  the semiconductor supply chain involves a network of suppliers of hundreds of complex components and machines that is impossible to onshore completely.

Insofar as subsidies could boost ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù manufacturing such processes would continue relying on foreign inputs ‚Äî including foreign talent. Thus the more sensible approach Congress should pursue is enacting market-oriented reforms that ensure companies can mobilize resources in response to ever-changing market dynamics and have access to global markets and resources. Such reforms include expanding high-skilled immigration making capital investments fully and immediately tax-deductible negotiating trade agreements and liberalizing military-related trade to include allies with complementary strengths in semiconductor production.

These reforms would do better at enhancing the industry‚Äôs dynamism lowering consumer prices and bolstering U.S. national security than broad inefficient and potentially distortive subsidies.

Microsoft tools are innovative flexible and packed with constantly evolving features. However perhaps most importantly of all they‚Äôre designed with a strong focus on user experience.

Within the Microsoft Teams ecosystem companies gain access to a flexible environment where they can empower teams provision tools and build the ultimate hybrid workplace. One of the many features within the admin environment is the ‚ÄúMicrosoft Teams Device Management‚Äù hub.

Here administrators can evaluate monitor provision and manage all kinds of Teams endpoints from an all-in-one ecosystem. You can update firmware from a distance restart tools and monitor diagnostics for your devices and even create and assign profiles to endpoints.

Here‚Äôs what you need to know about Microsoft Device Management.

What is Microsoft Teams Device Management?

Microsoft Teams Device Management is an environment within the Teams admin centre where business leaders can maintain control over their endpoints. You can create profiles for devices update firmware check metrics and even purchase new products within the Microsoft Device store.

To manage devices and configuration within Microsoft Teams you‚Äôll need to be assigned to a specific role. Namely you‚Äôll need to be one of the following:

A Teams Device admin

A Teams Service admin

A Microsoft 365 Global admin

Notably the Microsoft Teams Device Management environment allows companies to control and configure any device certified for and enrolled in Teams. This means you‚Äôll need to ensure the endpoints you choose are approved by Teams before you get started. You can find a list of approved devices on the Microsoft website or simply use the Microsoft Device Store to purchase endpoints.

Certified devices can include everything from conference and desk phones to Microsoft Teams Rooms Teams displays and panels. To manage your devices visit the Microsoft Teams admin centre and scroll down to ‚ÄúTeams devices‚Äù then click on the device type. Each form of device has its own specific section in the hub.

What Can You Do with Teams Device Management?

Earlier this week British regulators became the first in the world to authorize Moderna‚Äôs bivalent vaccine which protects against both the original strain of the novel coronavirus and the Omicron BA.1 subvariant.

Health Canada is currently reviewing bivalent booster candidates from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech which leaves some Canadians debating whether to wait for the revamped shots or go for a booster now.

With viral circulation projected to pick up as the season changes some provinces are encouraging people to get a booster of the approved version of the vaccine. For many people that would mean a fourth or fifth dose of the original formula.

Experts say the extent to which the bivalent vaccines provide additional protection from catching COVID-19 is still being studied and the cost-benefit analysis of waiting for one depends on the person.

Here‚Äôs a look at what we know about the bivalent vaccines and how they could factor into a fall wave.

WHEN WILL BIVALENT VACCINES BE AVAILABLE?

Health Canada received Moderna‚Äôs bivalent vaccine application on June 30 while its British counterpart got the paperwork to start its review earlier that month spokesman Mark Johnson said in an email. Pfizer filed a submission for its updated shot on July 25.

While the agency didn‚Äôt provide a timeline on when these reviews are set to wrap up Health Canada has already asked vaccine manufacturers to further tweak their bivalent vaccines to target the fast-spreading Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants ‚Äúas soon as possible‚Äù Johnson said.

Canada‚Äôs chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says Canada has secured a ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù supply of bivalent vaccines if regulators greenlight a rollout.

Infectious disease specialist Dr. Zain Chagla said he expects to see more countries authorize bivalent vaccines in the coming weeks and months which should give Canada time to integrate the updated shots into its fall immunization campaign.

HOW DO BIVALENT BOOSTERS COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL VACCINES?

Currently available COVID-19 vaccines are monovalent ‚Äì tailored solely to the original novel coronavirus. In addition to defending against this earlier strain the proposed bivalent vaccines were designed to recognize specific mutations in Omicron‚Äôs spike protein that make it better at evading immune detection.

These updated vaccines may provide ‚Äúincremental‚Äù added protection against catching Omicron but the extent remains to be seen said Tam.

Chagla an associate professor at Hamilton‚Äôs McMaster University said bivalent vaccines may not be the gamechanger that some have hoped for in curbing the spread of the virus.

As the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants gain steam in much of the country the BA.1-tailored bivalent vaccines might not be that much better than a first-generation booster when it comes to deterring COVID-19 infection Chagla said.

Emerging research suggests that the protection provided by currently available boosters wanes within six to eight weeks said Chagla. He expects that bivalent vaccines could extend this period by a few additional weeks _ not months.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to be proven wrong‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt know if this is going to reset the clock.‚Äù

Both the old and new versions of the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes he noted.

SHOULD I WAIT TO GET A BIVALENT VACCINE?

The short answer is: it depends.

Provinces have expanded access to fourth ‚Äì and in Quebec fifth ‚Äì doses of the original COVID-19 vaccine with the expectation that COVID-19 cases will spike as temperatures fall.

With the health-care system already stretched to its limits the priority needs to be boosting those at highest risk of landing in hospital such as immunocompromised people and older adults Chagla said.

But as a greater share of the population has gained hybrid immunity it wouldn‚Äôt be unreasonable for low-risk people to wait for the latest version of the vaccine Chagla said.

Tam encouraged Canadians to weigh both their personal risks and level of COVID-19 spread in their community. But if it‚Äôs been more than six months since your last infection or vaccination you may want to roll up your sleeves for another shot before the cold weather sets in she said.

‚ÄúIf you waited too long the wave could be starting‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThen you don‚Äôt derive as much benefit.‚Äù

PLAYING THE CATCH-UP GAME

A key challenge in COVID-19 control is that the evolution of the virus has far outpaced the time it takes to develop test manufacture review and roll out a vaccine that can counteract the latest mutation.

‚ÄúBy the time the wave occurs ‚Äì two to three months ‚Äì that‚Äôs barely enough to scratch the surface of getting a new vaccine‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is this catch-up game that‚Äôs occurring all the time.‚Äù

He hopes the inaugural rollout of bivalent vaccines could provide a ‚Äúproof-of-concept‚Äù that will fast-track this process for future iterations of the vaccine similar to how the flu shot is tweaked every fall to target variants that are circulating.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with this being a flu-season-like model where people just get updated for a certain amount of time‚Äù he said.

While we can‚Äôt expect perfect protection from getting sick we can have the tools to prevent severe illness among the most vulnerable.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre lucky to have this technology.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,

What Went On In Building 23?,"There once was a revolutionary psychiatric center in Brentwood New York notorious for treating certain patients by drilling a hole in their head to treat their mental illness. Abandoned buildings a brick silo and a graveyard filled with former patients are about all that remains of the 'Lobotomy Hospital' Pilgrim State Hospital.

WARNING: Under no circumstances should you enter this property. By doing so you risk bodily harm and/or prosecution for trespassing on private property.

Building 23 at the Pilgrim State Hospital was the site of thousands of the crude 45 minute brain surgeries known as a lobotomy. These operations started at the hospital in the 1940's and continued into the 70's. Often times these procedures would leave the individual lifeless.

A lobotomy was the leading treatment for mental illness until 1980's when drugs became available. Once pharmaceuticals reached the public not only did the procedure go away so did the need for such facilities. But what is left behind?

Many say the old site holds a lot of spirit energy perhaps of former patients. There is a graveyard on the property and many buried here are those that once endured a lobotomy. Many of their graves are simply marked with a number and no name.

Carpet maker Bremworth isn't wavering from its move to ditch synthetic alternatives for strong wool carpets even though it has come at a cost and a court case.

A legal stoush between Mohawk Industries-owned Godfrey Hirst - with revenues of $US11 billion last year - and Bremworth turned a corner about three weeks ago.

Godfrey Hirst abandoned its claim for damages at a High Court hearing.

It brought the case against Bremworth saying the company's claims around wool carpets being ""better for the environment"" and that a switch from synthetics to all wool carpets was ""changing for good"" were misleading.

Bremworth said this was despite Godfrey Hirst making similar claims including that it took pride in making the most environmentally friendly carpet on the planet.

Bremworth adopted a new strategy in which it shifted to only producing wool carpets in mid-2020.

Chief executive Greg Smith told 300 delegates at a red meat sector conference in Christchurch that it had looked at all the signs to see where consumers were heading and realised it could not compete in the cheap market.

""What did it all mean? It meant dropping around $60 million in revenue to reinvent the business to rebalance the business and grow again.

""That takes courage and that's the No 1 reason I joined Bremworth because there's a ton of businesses with words on the wall but not many places are prepared to take that type of decision and drop that type of income and grow again.""

The father of five children said Bremworth had reinvented itself as a premium design soft flooring and furnishing business with a focus on sustainability and like-minded consumers.

""Not everyone's happy with what we did. Not only did we make the big decision to drop the synthetics we actually made it very clear why we were doing that why we were going good.

""So we were very aggressive in extolling the virtues of strong wool and very aggressive in showing exactly what goes into synthetic carpet and our competitors really didn't like it.

""In fact on my first day at Bremworth they sued us.""

He said that had since changed with damages dropped against them.

""We are still going to court in September 2023 but somehow it's believed that mining subterranean carbon and the byproduct of that being plastic is more sustainable than sheep on hills on grass.

""So we look forward to that and won't shy away from that and that's the challenge we all have in front of us today to be bold to be courageous and make a line in the sand.""

Bremworth had gone from the darling of the sharemarket in the 1980s to the early-2000s with a share price at about $5 and dividends being paid 75 per cent of profits to at its worst 15c.

""That's a tough pill to swallow but the majority of shareholders have stuck with us and we hope to reward them over the coming years with the dividends they've been denied and with the value of the share price going up as a result of our success.""

About $10 million had been spent in marketing over the past two and a half years to talk about why strong wool was ""awesome"".

This was partly financed by the sale of plant land and buildings at Papatoetoe for about $24 million and through profits.

Smith said it would continue to invest more money over the next two years in New Zealand Australia and North America because perceptions of wool were changing to it being more sustainable and natural.

It would continue to make it clear that synthetics were man-made he said.

He said it was important to make profits because meaningful change would not be made otherwise.

It was committed to a $4.9 million sustainability programme and had just released a compostable rug that could be returned to the Earth.

Ultimately it could be upcycled into carpets rugs or other products such as insulation and underlay he said.

Another focus was on energy efficiency and carbon reduction.

Smith said better returns for farmers were important as wool supply was its No 1 threat with strong wool being stored in sheds because of low prices.

Before ""big oil"" came in with synthetic carpet wool was being picked off barbed wire fences at one stage because of its value.

He said wool carpet went on the backfoot when synthetic carpets were marketed as being cheaper and able to be recycled as it was plastic and then became softer with more lustre.

Bremworth entered the synthetic market but could not keep up with sole-business brands.

""But nothing lasts forever and fast forward a decade and consumers are waking up to the fact that plastic-based products are a problem and plastic doesn't go away or break down it only breaks up and as a result it pollutes our waterways our oceans and gets into our food chain.""

Smith said companies he had previously worked for - Icebreaker and Michael Hill Jeweller - were started by business founders prepared to challenge the norm when their industries faced enormous change and challenges.

He said the red meat sector should not be afraid of being bold while it faced challenges with the movement away from farming and real food towards plant-based products.",,,,,,,,,

It was a partnership with a purpose that started in 2020 and has resulted in the collection of 43000 kilos of post-consumer plastic which were then repurposed into upcycled products.

Two years later food manufacturer Mondelƒìz International and social enterprise The Plastic Flamingo (PLAF) expanded their plastic waste collection and recycling project through a partnership with Megaworld Corporation.

‚ÄúSustainability is one of our core thrusts as a company. We are always open to collaborating with organizations which promote the same values. I want to thank Mondelƒìz International and PLAF for working with us in this milestone project‚Äù said Megaworld Lifestyle Malls head Graham Coates.

The project will cover a year-long waste collection drive in five Megaworld Lifestyle Malls‚ÄîEastwood Mall Lucky Chinatown Mall McKinley Hall Uptown Bonifacio and Arcovia City.

Consumers who bring in their plastic waste in the five participating malls can get Mondelƒìz International treats in exchange for helping support proper waste management.

‚ÄúOur goal is to make snacks with better packaging to make it easier to recycle; to use less packaging by optimizing our pack sizes; and supporting improved systems through the collection of as much plastic as we put into the environment‚Äù Mondelez International Country Manager for Corporate and Government Affairs Joseph Fabul said.

L to R: Erica Reyes The Plastic Flamingo Chief Operating Officer Atty. Joseph Fabul Mondelƒìz International Country Manager for Corporate and Government Affairs Aleli Arcilla Mondelƒìz International VP and Managing Director and Denisse Malong General Manager for Eastwood City

‚ÄúWe are glad that our malls have become avenues where people can practice a greener lifestyle. At Megaworld we are committed to a culture of environmental consciousness and we continuously look for ways to practice and incorporate it in our township and lifestyle properties‚Äù added Coates.

Ideally plastic wastes should end up in the Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) of every barangay for segregation where these would be recycled depending on the type‚Äîwhether it is a bottle or sachet. However there are still a lot of plastic wastes that are not disposed of properly or when collected which would then be illegally dumped on open land or in bodies of water‚Äîsomething that PLAF seeks to prevent.

‚ÄúWe want to become part of the solution and not the pollution‚Äù said PLAF Chief Operating Officer Erica Reyes.

‚ÄúOur work at PLAF consists of collecting segregating transforming and designing plastic for reuse. We make practical construction materials out of plastic like eco-lumber and eco-boards. This ensures that we are able to recycle plastic and at the same time help reduce the use of precious resources like wood or minerals to make furniture or even shelters‚Äù she added.

At present PLAF using plastic wastes creates and sells eco-lumber and eco-boards which can be used to make outdoor furniture bike racks benches and tables among others.

This year Mondelƒìz continues to strengthen its partnership with PLAF and aims to collect and recycle another 20000 kilos and turn them into usable eco-boards with the help of Megaworld Corporation.

The former Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski recently retired as one of the dominant forces in the history of the NFL. The veteran had amassed enough wealth throughout his career in the form of salary bonuses and his contract deals but it turns out Gronk never touched a single penny from his salaries and NFL earnings. While most players splurge their money on luxuries the 33-year-old was busy saving money for his post-retirement life.

The Arizona product played for a total of 11 seasons in the league. Nine with the Patriots and the remaining two with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. During this entire period he earned nearly $70 million including salary and all the unlocked bonuses. But guess what he never touched it.

All the time he was living on the money that he earned through brand endorsements media and similar deals. Some of his deals included brands like Dunkin‚Äô Donuts Visa T-Mobile Lyft Cheerios Monster Energy Drink Tide and a popular commercial with USAA.

This offseason he was also engaged in anchoring for a kids‚Äô show. His daily expenses were carried out through such earnings. It doesn‚Äôt imply that he is a miser but he maintained financial discipline because of his future being football.

Back in 2019 when he announced his retirement from the Patriots Gronk emphasized this agenda of spending the money. He said that he had seen various instances where it takes only a flash of a second to wipe out. Looking back he claims to be confident about having enough wealth to steer him in the next phase of life.

Gronk always played a prime role in Tom Brady‚Äôs chase for a Super Bowl title. Whether it was with the Patriots or the Buccaneers Gronkowski was always by his side. He has four Super Bowl titles and five Pro Bowl selections to his name.

Now there is a big asterisk next to this list as Blockdata said quite plainly that it couldn‚Äôt get the actual dollar amounts of each company‚Äôs individual investments. As such they took the size of the rounds as a proxy on the theory that investors spend more on companies that raise more.

As for the firms offering payments:

Anchorage Digital is a digital asset custody firm that received the crypto industry‚Äôs first federal bank charter. Aside from that it has a specific offering giving merchants the ability to settle payments ranging from peer-to-peer to cross-border.

Bullish investors have started believing the US stock markets are turning around after a downbeat first half of the year.

Optimists such as Fundstrat's Tom Lee have argued that prices for equities have bottomed out and say the summer rally on the major US benchmarks is a flashing sign they'll hit all-time-highs before the end of 2022.

The S&P 500 is up about 17% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has gained over 20% over the past two months as of early Friday. Traders have found cause for cheer in the Federal Reserve's pledge to be data-dependent on interest-rate hikes and in a lower-than-expected July inflation print which have eased worries about recession.

But Wall Street's biggest names aren't buying it. Big bank analysts have argued that stocks' current rebound is just a classic bear market rally ‚Äî when equities rise sharply but just for a short time before resuming a long-term decline.

""Stocks are still not inexpensive despite the bear market"" Bank of America's Savita Subramanian an equity and quant strategist said in a recent research note.

""In fact they are more expensive after the S&P 500's 17% rally from its June low driven by a drop in the cost of equity.""

This is not the right moment for investors to try to time the bottom and disappointing economic data could push stocks lower according to analysts like Subramanian and UBS' Jason Draho.

""Becoming more optimistic in the current highly uncertain environment does make the markets more vulnerable to negative news"" Draho the head of Americas asset allocations at the Swiss bank said.

Wall Street's base case remains stocks won't stage a true revival until the Fed pivots and starts cutting interest rates. The US central bank hiked rates by 75 basis points in June and July to try to tame inflation which is running close to a four-decade high.

Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson has cautioned investors not to bet on a rate-hike pause any time soon. The bank's CIO noted that July's strong labor market report ‚Äî which showed the US adding 528000 jobs ‚Äî would give the Fed scope to continue tightening aggressively.

""While inflation appears to be peaking it's not likely to come off at a pace fast enough to spur the type of sustained Fed pause the equity market is already discounting"" Wilson said in a recent research note.

Bank of America said this week that it expects rate hikes to continue until February 2023 with nominal interest rates hitting 4%. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs said a Fed pause would likely only happen at the end of 2022.

While it's tempting to dive into equity markets the consensus on Wall Street is that investors should be biding their time rather than buying indiscriminately.

""The message from us for the next several months remains"" Wilson said. ""Risk/reward is unattractive and this bear market remains incomplete.""

""From Brussels to Tokyo to Washington governments are determined to lower their dependence on Beijing"" it underlined.

Explaining it by an example it said It was a difficult balancing act for New Delhi when it decided to abstain from the 15-nation UN security council vote to condemn Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. The stance was clear that Delhi didn‚Äôt want to alienate Russia an important historical friend which supplies 46% of its military equipment without also antagonizing the U.S. its largest trading partner.

The global brokerage feels India's geographical stance makes economic condition of the country favuorable for a decade.

However it feels the India is yet to realise the kind of industrial transformation that turned countries like China and South Korea into miracle economies by building their manufacturing capabilities.

But this is changing with the government's efforts to actively incentivize large scale manufacturing capacities through production linked incentive (PLI) schemes. ""India‚Äôs economic growth was led by services unlike the Asian tigers. PLI schemes have attracted interest across 14 sectors including automobiles solar panels and advanced batteries. Buoyed by the government‚Äôs PLI scheme India now is an exporter of mobile phones"" it underlined.

India Vs China

Delhi is also focusing on import substitution in manufacturing to enhance domestic capacity and reduce external dependence. ""As firms everywhere reconfigure supply chains to lessen their reliance on China India has an opportunity to increase its manufacturing helped by a $26 billion subsidy scheme.

As per Morgan Stanely while India has been reducing dependence on China and working on generating employment China struggles with working-age population which has been decreasing .

""Emerging sectors such as aerospace semiconductors and renewables should help increase youth employment. The reform measures are starting to pay off. The ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù initiative encourages both foreign and domestic investment in the manufacturing sector; ‚ÄúSmart Cities‚Äù aims to eradicate urban squalor and ‚ÄúDigital India‚Äù targets an overhaul of government services with electronic identity digital payments and bank accounts"" it said.

On the contrast China‚Äôs economy is slowing down faced with a shrinking workforce industrial overcapacity a floundering property market a mountain of debt and renewed COVID lockdowns.

Speaking on status of the real estate in the two countries it said while investment to GDP ratio in India hovers at 30% China‚Äôs has peaked at 45% and a big share of that is real estate investment. The real estate sector accounts for around 29% of GDP in China more than double the ratio in India according to IMF economist Yuanchen Yang.

The working-age population in China is now shrinking which will further erode the demand for housing over the coming years hurting future growth it said.

""The reverse holds in India. After being in doldrums for the past 3 years India‚Äôs real estate sector is set to recover. As more of India‚Äôs population heads to the cities demand for housing increases"" said the brokerage."

Hello I'm Oscar. In this trailer I introduce the new features of Season 02 of the Mosaic of China podcast. This includes the PREMIUM version of the show with 10-15 minutes of extra content for every episode.

Listen Here

Transcript

OF: Hello this is Oscar Fuchs. And welcome to Season 2 of the Mosaic of China podcast. Just like Season 1 over the next 30 episodes we will be hearing from a diverse group of 30 people who are making their mark in China. I don't want to ruin any surprises so let me just say that there are some great stories from both Chinese and non-Chinese guests on their way over the coming weeks.

If you're a new listener welcome and here's a quick recap of how the show works. There are three parts to each interview. The first part is a straightforward two-way conversation which starts with the guest introducing an object that in some way describes their life in China. In the second part I ask every guest the same 10 China-related questions all on the theme of their personal experiences tastes and opinions. And the final part is just one extra question where I ask each guest to nominate someone for the next Season of Mosaic of China. And this is how the tiles of this Mosaic will connect and continue to build out in future seasons.

There are also a few things that are new in Season 2 one of them being that this is the first time that we can link new guests back to the people who nominated them from the previous season of the show. So you'll hear how that works in the first episode coming next week. Secondly there will be transcripts available now on https://mosaicofchina.com/transcripts. These have been designed for anyone whose first language isn't English or of course for listeners with hearing impairments or for any English speakers who want to follow the words spoken in Chinese. Thirdly if you'd like to join the community and track all the images alongside each episode on WeChat I've finally been able to rename the WeChat account to ID: mosaicofchina all one word so please add me there from now on and I'll add you to the group. That's consistent now with the accounts that already exist at @mosaicofchina_* on Instagram and @mosaicofchina on Facebook if you would still prefer to follow there.

And finally the biggest difference for Season 2 is that there will now be TWO versions of the show. The normal version will be exactly the same as last season. But I'm also releasing an extended version of the show where there will be an average of 10-20 minutes of extra content for every episode. These will accumulate to up to 10 hours of extra content over the course of the entire season and they can be accessed for the tiny cost of US$2 per month at https://patreon.com/mosaicofchina.com all one word. This is the way I came up with to keep the show free from advertising to still allow you to listen to the series for free while at the same time create a a way to accept donations towards the cost of putting this all together. So if you have anything to spare and you want to help fund this independent project as an early Christmas present please head over to patreon.com/mosaicofchina and you can look forward to getting some great extra content too.

Thanks to all of you for your continued support and I hope to see you back here next week for Episode 1 of the Season.

OAKTON Va. ‚Äî Fairfax County Public Schools has moved 22 bus stops away from Blake Lane in response to the crash at the Five Oaks Road intersection that killed two Oakton High School students and left a third injured.

Starting Monday Aug. 22 students will wait for the bus on side streets at least 50 feet away from Blake Lane. Once school bus drivers ensure that traffic has stopped they will motion for students to board.

Fairfax County School Board Member Karl Frisch informed his constituents about the changes made following a safety study evaluating school bus safety along the corridor.

Six stops will remain on Blake Lane because the side streets lack the capacity for buses to turn around but no students will have to wait along the roadway moving forward.

In a statement Fairfax County School Board Karl Frisch said ‚ÄúMoving these bus stops will enhance student safety while local and state partners continue working together to mitigate speeding and other traffic concerns in the area.‚Äù

New signage has been installed along the 35 mph corridor and the Fairfax County Public Awareness Campaign has put up signs reminding drivers to slow down.

""After that accident people are thinking that speed is a concern"" said Oakton resident Shiva Bucireddy to WUSA9 about the June 7 crash that killed two Oakton High School students and left a third injured. Bucireddy says he has lived in the area for six years and he would like to see more extreme measures in place.

""Yeah speed cameras are a good idea to enforce that everyone is following the speed"" said Bucireddy.

The alleged driver involved in the incident 18-year-old Usman Shahid has been charged with involuntary manslaughter after police said he was driving 81 mph in the 35 mph zone.

Fairfax County has expanded the area where drivers can face $200 fines for speeding along the corridor.

School Board Member Frisch says county Supervisors have directed staff to provide recommendations on the purchase of additional speed deterrent devices. Supervisor Dalia Palchik has also convened a Blake Lane Safety Community Advisory Group.

During the safety meetings some residents have requested Fairfax County Police to park patrol cars along Blake Lane to deter speeding but police say they simply do not have enough officers to do that.

The Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC‚Äôs) Rangeview conservation project is located south of Robsart and is six kilometres west of the Old Man on His Back Prairie and Heritage Conservation Area NCC‚Äôs flagship property in the province.

The Rangeview property contains 521 hectares of grasslands and wetlands including seasonal creeks and riparian areas. The property and surrounding areas inhabit many different species of plants and animals including several listed as threatened under Canada‚Äôs Species at Risk Act including chestnut-collared longspur common nighthawk ferruginous hawk Sprague‚Äôs pipit and swift fox.

Jennifer McKillop Vice-President for NCC‚Äôs Saskatchewan Region stated ‚ÄúLooking at the beautiful landscape on the Rangeview property I get a sense of hope that future generations can experience all that nature has to offer. I‚Äôm grateful for our donors and partners who help conserve grasslands and the rich biodiversity found in the region. Their support ensures a thriving world for both nature and people.‚Äù

In a media release by the NCC it states ‚ÄúThe generosity of private donors and the estates of William Gibbs and Margaret Smith helped make this long-lasting impact for nature. These donations help NCC obtain match funding from the federal government and other partners. The Government of Canada is a major funding contributor through the Natural Heritage Conservation Program part of Canada‚Äôs Nature Fund. The project was also significantly supported by funds from The MapleCross Fund The Mosaic Company TC Energy U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Walmart Canada.‚Äù

Conserving grasslands provides solutions to counter the challenges of rapid biodiversity loss and the impacts of climate change state the NCC.

‚ÄúThe twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss are two sides of the same coin and we must tackle them together. By working with partners like the Nature Conservancy of Canada individual and corporate donors we are helping to protect the natural environment in Saskatchewan and across the country. Through programs like the Natural Heritage Conservation Program our Government is helping progress toward our goal of conserving a quarter of lands and oceans in Canada by 2025‚Äù stated The Honourable Steven Guilbeault Minister of Environment and Climate Change.

‚Äúgrasslands store carbon filter our water and help prevent flooding and droughts. In the past two years alone NCC has influenced the protection of more than 1 million hectares (almost twice the size of Banff National Park) coast to coast to coast‚Äù stated the release.

The NCC plans on doubling its impact by mobilizing Canadians and delivering permanent large-scale conservation success.

Stock investors have now contended with two bear markets in a span of 2 1/2 years. They're also facing historically high inflation and back-to-back quarters of U.S. gross domestic product retracements.

Yet in spite of this turmoil cryptocurrencies have soared. Since bottoming out at an aggregate valuation of $141 billion in March 2020 the total value of the crypto market has exploded to nearly $3 trillion. Even following a sizable pullback the value of all digital currencies is higher by nearly 700% in 29 months.

Shiba Inu has set the standard for historic gains in the cryptocurrency space

Although crypto's ""Big Two"" -- Bitcoin and Ethereum -- are given a lot of credit for these nominal gains it's the jaw-dropping percentage gain in meme token Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) that's driven interest in the digital currency space.

In 2021 Shiba Inu did things that were previously thought impossible from an investable asset. After beginning the year at a microscopic valuation of $0.000000000073 per token according to CoinMarketCap.com SHIB would climb to an all-time high of $0.00008841 less than 10 months later. By removing six zeroes after its decimal point SHIB coins skyrocketed an unfathomable 121109489%! Put another way an investor with the luck stomach and wherewithal to invest one dollar at midnight on Jan. 1 2021 was a millionaire by Oct. 27 2021.

Following a sizable pullback SHIB tokens ended 2021 higher by approximately 46000000% and set the standard for what momentum and social media hype can achieve in the cryptocurrency space.

However Shiba Inu investors aren't counting on SHIB's run-up being a one-and-done. In the two-month stretch between June 18 2022 and Aug. 18 2022 SHIB has more than doubled in value to nearly $0.000015. It's beginning to reignite the momentum-based euphoria that sparked the token's 2021 run as well as renewing calls among holders that SHIB could eventually reach $0.01 per coin.

What would it take for Shiba Inu to increase in value by more than 67000% to reach $0.01 per token by as soon as 2023? Let's take a closer look.

What would it take for Shiba Inu to reach $0.01?

In order for SHIB to make a second historic run over a three-year stretch (2021-2023) three catalysts would have to be executed flawlessly.

To begin with innovation would have to drive Shiba Inu tokens higher. The key project at the moment is the expected launch of a public beta test of Shibarium during the third quarter (July through September).

Shibarium is an internally developed layer-2 blockchain that's designed to dramatically lower transaction costs for SHIB. If transactions costs fall by a considerable amount it would likely encourage more merchants to accept SHIB as a form of payment. But more importantly it would roll out the red carpet for non-fungible token (NFT)-based gaming and NFT marketplaces to thrive. Shiba Inu's developers can't meaningfully venture into the metaverse or blockchain-based gaming until transactions costs are brought down.

Secondly Shiba Inu would have to conduct meaningful and ongoing coin burn events. Think of coin burn as being similar to a publicly traded company buying back its own stock. By removing existing tokens from the circulating supply each remaining coin that investors hold on to is a bit scarcer. That's important because CoinMarketCap.com lists the project as having roughly 549 trillion coins outstanding as of this past week. There would need to be a significant number of coins removed from circulation to provide a lift to SHIB's price.

For what it's worth Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin who was gifted roughly half of SHIB's 1 quadrillion token supply sent more than 410 trillion coins to a dead blockchain address last year. With these coins now inaccessible 41% of SHIB's supply was taken out with the click of a button.

And third Shiba Inu would need a repeat of the social media euphoria that sent it ascending to the heavens in 2021. While there's no concrete blueprint social media sites would need to be abuzz with SHIB for momentum to take over.

The doghouse is far likelier for SHIB than reaching $0.01 in 2023

Now that we've had a look at what would need to happen for Shiba Inu to reach $0.01 by 2023 let's get down to brass tacks: How feasible is $0.01 by 2023?

While nothing can ever be written off in the cryptocurrency arena following a 46000000% single-year gain there's virtually no chance of SHIB coming anywhere close to $0.01 by the end of next year. In fact winding up in the doghouse is more likely than SHIB heading higher from its current price.

To start with the basics a $0.01 target would equate to a nearly $5.5 trillion valuation. That's nearly two times the market cap of Apple a company that's generated over $118 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period and has led with its innovation for more than a decade. Shiba Inu hasn't demonstrated that any of its innovations are going to work let alone be useful in the real world. That's makes a $5.5 trillion market cap pretty much untenable.

Maybe the bigger issue is that Shiba Inu lacks anything resembling a competitive advantage. While it does have faithful holders Shiba Inu is ultimately nothing more than an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. In other words it's just a glorified payment coin and there are thousands of cryptocurrencies that can facilitate payments.

To build on this point it's not even a popular payment coin. According to online business directory Cryptwerk only 659 mostly obscure global merchants were accepting SHIB as a form of payment in August 2022. This figure hasn't budged in months due to the volatility in SHIB's price and its inability to stand out in an increasingly crowded field.

Coin burn also seems unlikely to meaningfully help Shiba Inu. While a small percentage of merchants and coin burn events could remove millions or even billions of tokens from circulation whittling down 549 trillion coins into a much smaller figure that would allow for SHIB's price to appreciate is going to take a really long time.

Lastly history has proved unkind to payment coins that deliver monumental gains. Following their peak (which was Oct. 27 2021 for SHIB) payment coins have a history of losing 93% to 99%+ of their value in the subsequent two years. Shiba Inu already shed 91% of its value at its peak decline through June 2022. The expectation is that SHIB is facing an even larger retracement.

The popular streaming service has informed its partners that children‚Äôs programming and original movies will be immune to advertising on its new cheaper ad-supported plan according to a report from Bloomberg . The plan is set to launch near the start of 2023 and will cost less than the current ‚Äústandard‚Äù plan  which runs customers $15.49/mo for HD streaming. It‚Äôs possible it could replace the $10/mo standard-definition plan that‚Äôs already in place but Netflix has yet to confirm pricing for the new ad-supported tier.

The price isn‚Äôt the only part of this report that‚Äôs still up in the air. Netflix‚Äôs ‚Äúno ads on kid‚Äôs content or original movies‚Äù edict could have some carve-outs. For one Bloomberg says only ‚Äúsome‚Äù third parties that license children‚Äôs programming have asked Netflix not to run ads on their shows so it‚Äôs possible that others will have ads on them after all. In addition original movies could get ads eventually; Bloomberg‚Äôs report said they could only be ad-free ‚Äúat first.‚Äù

One thing that‚Äôs more certain about the new ad-supported plan is that anyone who pays for it will lose one feature that comes with more expensive versions of Netflix. Namely they won‚Äôt be able to download shows or movies for offline viewing. If you want to watch Stranger Things on an airplane you better pay for slow airline WiFi or shell out for a higher tier of Netflix.

Still that said Netflix turning off ads on children‚Äôs shows is probably for the best. Kids don‚Äôt need to have things sold to them.

The actress spoke with Decider for an interview published Friday to promote her new film Spin Me Round and she was asked about the surprising turn of events surrounding the end of her Netflix series GLOW. In September 2019 the show had been picked up for a fourth and final season but the streamer reversed the decision in October 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and announced it was done for good.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the great heartbreak of my career‚Äù Brie admitted to the outlet. ‚ÄúBut it will forever live on as like this great thing. I loved working on it ‚Äî maybe more than anything I‚Äôve worked on ‚Äî and I miss it a lot. But I feel very grateful for the time I had on the show.‚Äù

When asked further about Netflix‚Äôs change of plans Brie added ‚ÄúYeah it was surprising! But it was sort of eclipsed by the shock of everything that was happening globally. (Laughs.) You know so in a way it was almost like it put things in perspective.‚Äù

GLOW which earned 18 Emmy nominations and three wins over the course of its run was a fictionalized telling of the real-life women‚Äôs professional wrestling program called Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling that launched in the 1980s.

This quote is also an apt metaphor for a career that's seen the 57-year-old rise to the position of editor of News of the World at just 29 be sacked from rival tabloid the Daily Mirror for publishing fake photographs of British soldiers in Iraq - before securing a job on CNN in the U.S. - only to be axed three years into the deal in 2014 due to poor ratings.

He was then hired as Mail Online's editor-at-large where Morgan maintained his well-read column while stepping back onto television with a fulltime hosting role on Good Morning Britain.

In 2021 Morgan stormed off the set and out of the job after he was confronted on air about comments he made regarding Meghan Markle following her controversial Oprah interview with Prince Harry.

But just one year later Morgan finds himself under a new kind of pressure just six months after signing a monster $100million (AUD) deal with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

The word from Sky News' Sydney headquarters is 'Piers Morgan: Uncensored' - only launched in April - may ultimately be dumped from Australian screens due to poor ratings.

The show which premiered in the U.S. on Fox on the new British channel TVTalk and on Sky News in Australia initially attracted solid numbers on the back of a multi-million dollar advertising campaign and an interview with Donald Trump.

Piers Morgan's show is struggling in the ratings. He's pictured here with a cocktail in front of the Murdoch's private jet

Piers Morgan: Uncensored has sunk to a viewership of less than 100000 in the UK and 18000 in Australia

In Australia 90000 viewers tuned in to the first hour-long program which airs from Sunday to Thursday at 9pm.

However within just a few weeks those numbers had dropped significantly.

Shortly before Morgan's four-week long summer hiatus which he announced to his Twitter followers in late July Uncensored was drawing an average of just 18000 viewers in Australia.

It's a slide mirrored in the UK viewing figures which have dropped by about 80% since its debut - from 317000 to just 60000.

Morgan has featured a number of high-profile names on his show including Cristiano Ronaldo

Morgan's figures in Australia are dwarfed by his Sky News colleagues. Paul Murray's 'Paul Murray Live' regularly averages over 40000 viewers per night.

Credlin helmed by Tony Abbott's former chief of staff Peta Credlin also easily out-performed Uncensored with a 35000 nightly average.

For context Sky News' free-to-air prime-time rivals Seven News and Nine News average about 900000 viewers per night combined.

However Sky's top talent is watched widely on YouTube with some Australian hosts surprisingly popular in the U.S.

Now on a month-long break in the US where it's understood he is filming another season of his series Serial Killers 'Piers Morgan's Uncensored' is not being shown on Sky News' Australian schedule despite remaining on air in the UK under fill-in host Jeremy Kyle.

Most promotional images of Morgan have been quietly removed from the Sky News' website.

Morgan's relative failure comes with a degree of irony given he was supposed to be the big-name replacement for Alan Jones who was dumped by Sky News in November 2021 despite pulling an audience of 63000.

Lauded as Sky News' antidote to 'cancel culture' Morgan kicked off his series with a sit-down with Donald Trump.

'I'm going to cancel the cancel culture' he told Peta Credlin on Sky. 'I'm going to take those ultra woke lunatics head on.'

News Corp paid big money to promote the show (above is the ad near Sydney's Anzac Bridge)

Peta Credlin easily out-performed Uncensored with a 35000 nightly average.

Paul Murray remains the most popular figure on Sky News Australia despite earning a fraction of what Morgan is paid

Morgan boasted he would be 'calling out extremists from all sides not just in Australia but anywhere ‚Äì and especially those who think cancel culture's a great idea and want to compel us all to lead their own dreary joyless lifestyles'.

Morgan began what was a lavish promotional push in February when he arrived in Australia via Lachlan Murdoch's private jet to attend the 25th anniversary party of Sky News at the Sydney Opera House.

Discussing the upcoming election Morgan said he predicted Australians would 'elect the leader who they believe will move most swiftly to restore all freedom rights lost during the crisis and who will be strong on national security'.

Morgan's TV deal has a number of 'performance-based clauses' which allow News Corp to cut him loose say sources

Alan Jones made way for Morgan after he was dumped in November 2021

He later partied the night away with his new News Corp colleagues and followed it up with an appearance on Today opposite Karl Stefanovic (brother of Sky News breakfast anchor Peter Stefanovic) and Allison Langdon.

'Great to be back on breakfast TV again.. even if I did have to fly 10000 miles to find a morning show that would let me express my opinions!' he later tweeted.

But despite the international promotional push sources close to contract negotiations have told Daily Mail Australia that there were a number of 'performance-based' clauses built into Morgan's contract.

'Basically if the show doesn't rate it allows (News Corp) to exercise one or more of those clauses and end the contract without having to pay the full terms' said an insider.

'And it clearly isn't rating. So perhaps that's what Murdoch will now do.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Sky News Australia chief executive Paul Whittaker for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9saWZlc3R5bGUvaG9tZS90aGUtbmV3LWZpeGVyLXBydWUtbWlsbGVyLWdldHMteW91LW91dC1vZi1hLXN0aWNreS1zcG90L25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNzJjZmIzMWQyMTQ5ODE3MWU0MDk0ZWE4ZTFhMDEwMGbSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3cy5jb20uYXUvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2hvbWUvdGhlLW5ldy1maXhlci1wcnVlLW1pbGxlci1nZXRzLXlvdS1vdXQtb2YtYS1zdGlja3ktc3BvdC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzcyY2ZiMzFkMjE0OTgxNzFlNDA5NGVhOGUxYTAxMDBmP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The new Fixer: How to get out of a sticky spot,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/home/the-new-fixer-prue-miller-gets-you-out-of-a-sticky-spot/news-story/72cfb31d21498171e4094ea8e1a0100f on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9saWZlc3R5bGUvaG9tZS90aGUtbmV3LWZpeGVyLXBydWUtbWlsbGVyLWdldHMteW91LW91dC1vZi1hLXN0aWNreS1zcG90L25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNzJjZmIzMWQyMTQ5ODE3MWU0MDk0ZWE4ZTFhMDEwMGbSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3cy5jb20uYXUvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2hvbWUvdGhlLW5ldy1maXhlci1wcnVlLW1pbGxlci1nZXRzLXlvdS1vdXQtb2YtYS1zdGlja3ktc3BvdC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzcyY2ZiMzFkMjE0OTgxNzFlNDA5NGVhOGUxYTAxMDBmP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNhdHVyZGF5cGFwZXIuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9pbnNpZGUtcXVlZW5zbGFuZHMtZ3JlZW4td2F2ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Queensland's green wave,"In 2014 Jonathan Sriranganathan stood half-naked outside Queensland state parliament covered in body paint and unleashed a lyrical tirade against the government of Campbell Newman: ‚ÄúTwo-party system? Double the corruption!‚Äù Then he was shooting a video for his hip-hop band Rivermouth. But fast forward to 2022 and Jonno Sri as he is commonly known is perhaps as responsible as anyone for the ‚Äúgreenslide‚Äù that saw the Greens clinch three new inner-city seats in the house of representatives ‚Äì Ryan Griffith and Brisbane ‚Äì at the May election.

Most analysis of the Greens‚Äô success in Queensland has so far focused on the massive ground campaign in which hundreds of well-trained volunteers knocked on thousands of doors and the absence of ‚ÄúClimate 200‚Äù candidates. But it wasn‚Äôt just a one-off election campaign or an opportunistic response to this year‚Äôs floods or the lack of teals. The Greens have been making serious inroads in inner Brisbane for the past six years at least.

A Brisbane-born arts/law graduate of Tamil heritage Jonno Sri stood for the Greens in the Gabba ward of Brisbane‚Äôs City Council in 2016. He placed second with a primary vote of 32 per cent ‚Äì Labor preferences secured him the party‚Äôs first seat on the country‚Äôs most powerful local authority ‚Äì its first single-member electorate in Queensland. He moved out of his West End sharehouse onto a houseboat bought for $30000 so he could donate half of his $160000 annual salary to charity. He shot to national prominence wearing a rainbow scarf to his biggest press conference in 2017 standing alongside a tearful Senator Larissa Waters who had become the state‚Äôs first elected Greens politician in 2010 but resigned after discovering she was a dual citizen. Sri would go on to win re-election in Gabba in 2020 with a 13 per cent swing to him lifting his two-party margin above 62 per cent. Now Sri believes the lord mayoralty is winnable: ‚ÄúEvery election the major parties‚Äô vote in Brisbane is dropping and the Greens vote is rising and we‚Äôre at the point now where the Greens vote is going to be high enough that we could conceivably win the mayoralty in March 2024 along with half a dozen wards.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe political establishment the two major parties are so far behind the kind of progress that the community broadly wants to see.‚Äù

Sri‚Äôs success in the Gabba established a beachhead for the Greens in inner Brisbane. It was followed by another narrow win for environmental lawyer Michael Berkman in the Liberal-held state seat of Maiwar in 2017. Like Sri he squeaked into second place and Labor preferences helped make him the first Green elected to Queensland‚Äôs unicameral parliament ‚Äì for decades an unassailable barrier for the minor party. A 12 per cent swing towards Berkman won him re-election in 2020 and Amy MacMahon took the neighbouring seat of South Brisbane which closely matches the boundaries of the Gabba ward. Maiwar and South Brisbane fall within the federal electorates of Ryan and Griffith respectively and Sri has no doubt that the Greens‚Äô local and state wins paved the way for the breakthrough in May.

‚ÄúIn Brisbane people have had really positive experiences of Greens reps at the local and state level‚Äù Sri says. ‚ÄúThey see that we‚Äôre effective they see that we‚Äôre responsive and that makes it a lot easier to convince people to vote for us at the federal level too. Word of mouth does matter.‚Äù

Environmental activist and historian Drew Hutton who co-founded the Brisbane Greens in 1984 and ran for lord mayor the following year wholeheartedly agrees. Hutton stood for the Greens six times over the next 23 years lifting the primary vote around the West End stronghold from nothing to a career-best 26 per cent in his 2008 campaign for the Gabba ward. Barnaby Joyce narrowly beat him for the last senate seat in 2004. Bob Brown who co-founded the Australian Greens with Hutton 30 years ago describes him as ‚Äúthe best senator Queensland never had‚Äù.

Now 75 and retired Hutton has been critical of the Greens. In a controversial Facebook post at the end of last year he said he feared the party had ‚Äúlocked themselves into a middle class inner city tertiary educated identity politics-driven ghetto‚Äù and called for more spokespeople like Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie. But Hutton is a big fan of Sri describing his win in Gabba as a ‚Äúmajor breakthrough ‚Ä¶ I doubt if the business community likes Jonno too much but young people love him‚Äù.

Hutton sees Sri as a fellow traveller ‚Äì a campaigning Green. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a bit of a tendency to overthink in the Greens and to fall back on ideology and policy instead of realising that you‚Äôve actually got to get out there and convert those ideas into the lived reality of people.‚Äù

Sri has never worn a suit into Brisbane City Hall and says he probably never will but there‚Äôs much more to his brand of politics than his colourful outfits and his performances with Rivermouth or ska punk band the Mouldy Lovers. Sri believes strongly in grassroots democracy and one of his first moves as councillor was an exercise in participatory budgeting giving Gabba residents discretionary control over a $400000 budget for park upgrades.

Sri is routinely outvoted on the Liberal National Party-dominated council: in 2019 he failed to get up a climate emergency declaration and last year he was the only Brisbane councillor to vote against the city‚Äôs successful bid for the 2032 Olympics which he says will be unsustainable and will ‚Äúturbocharge gentrification‚Äù.

But he was the first councillor to call for the conversion of golf courses to public green space. Three years later the council announced the 18-hole Victoria Park golf course would close and make way for Brisbane‚Äôs biggest park in half a century.

Sri deliberately blurs the line between activism and politics. In 2018 when a mum with five children faced eviction from public housing Sri jumped on Facebook to organise a blockade to meet the police. The woman kept her home. Two months ago Sri and Michael Berkman helped stop another eviction this time of a disability pensioner. Sri went so far as to lock himself on to the front-door flyscreen. When the police came back a few days later so did the blockaders and the Housing Department backed down.

The Greens were born out of civil disobedience and Sri is part of that tradition acknowledging that ‚Äúactually I‚Äôve never been lawfully arrested so in some ways probably my record is a little bit cleaner than someone like Bob Brown on that front.‚Äù In 2020 he was arrested while protesting against the relocation of asylum seekers at a Kangaroo Point hotel to high-security detention and charged with failing to heed a police direction to leave. The charges were dropped days later due to lack of evidence. Sri believes some of the depiction of his forthright activism is racialised and cites the media treatment of Victorian Greens senator Lidia Thorpe who described the Queen as a ‚Äúcoloniser‚Äù in her swearing-in ceremony this month. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen some of the commentary about Lidia being too assertive or too forceful‚Äù says Sri ‚Äúwhen actually she‚Äôs saying and doing the same sorts of things as a lot of other Greens representatives but it‚Äôs just experienced differently by middle-class white people because they feel attacked when a First Nations person or a person of colour is highlighting fundamental injustices of the system.‚Äù

Michael Berkman likes to think he‚Äôs replicated Sri‚Äôs approach in Maiwar. He has focused heavily on local issues such as campaigning against a proposal to build six zip-lines down Mount Coot-tha stopping 43 new poker machines at the local pub and pushing for a new primary school at Toowong.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned more from Jonno ‚Äì about how to be an effective and useful local representative ‚Äì than anyone else just because he was the first in that local electorate-based representative role here in Queensland and he‚Äôs done a phenomenal job of it‚Äù he says.

He‚Äôs speaking after a week of estimates hearings he describes as ‚Äúfarcical‚Äù. In Queensland where all seven portfolio committees are government-chaired and only hold one day of hearings each year Berkman says opposition or crossbench MPs can barely ask a question.

‚ÄúThe chairs will very routinely just shut down lines of questioning whenever it gets uncomfortable based on spurious points of order‚Äù says Berkman who sits on the community services committee. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a joke ‚Ä¶ almost worse than nothing because it creates this impression of accountability that just doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

If the Greens‚Äô wins at local and state level set the scene for the party‚Äôs federal victories they were hardly assured. Political scientist Anne Tiernan who is an adjunct professor at Griffith University‚Äôs business school admits she is ‚Äúa bit surprised‚Äù that the Greens have emerged as such a force in Queensland. Going into the election she thought LNP voters might worry about Greens candidates in Brisbane ‚Äútaking instructions from inner-city Melbourne after the caravan debacle of 2019‚Äù.

Tiernan says many well-paid professionals in inner-city Brisbane derive income from the state‚Äôs huge coal and gas exports and did not take well to the Bob Brown Foundation‚Äôs Stop Adani convoy from Hobart to north Queensland ahead of the 2019 election. After Scott Morrison‚Äôs upset victory and as progressives joked about ‚ÄúQuexit‚Äù Tiernan challenged stereotypes of the state‚Äôs voters as deeply conservative ‚Äì the Newman government aside they‚Äôve elected Labor state governments since the Nationals wipeout in 1989.

In 2022 she says the Queensland Greens took a less confrontational approach to the climate campaign. ‚ÄúI think that tells you something about the federated structure of the [Greens] party‚Äù says Tiernan. ‚ÄúObviously the state organisation was much more attuned to that risk and able to assuage some of those concerns.‚Äù

Bob Brown rejects the criticism of the Adani convoy saying it boosted the Greens vote which jumped 3 percentage points to almost 10 per cent in the senate. That ensured Larissa Waters was re-elected which was critical to the party‚Äôs success the next time around. He says it‚Äôs wrong to suggest that ‚Äúoutsiders mustn‚Äôt talk about coal and gas in Queensland ‚Äì come on it‚Äôs not very brave‚Äù.

Climate Action Network Australia co-ordinator Dr Barry Traill rejects the argument that Labor lost the 2019 Queensland election because of coal. That case was first made by then Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce he says and parroted by the media but is not borne out by the data. Climate concern was prevalent among voters according to Traill but not yet enough to swing seats with the exception of Zali Steggall‚Äôs win in the Sydney seat of Warringah.

‚ÄúClimate mattered last time‚Äù he says adding that voter concern increased through fires and floods. ‚ÄúThis time it just went to the next step.‚Äù

Dr Sarah Cameron a chief investigator for the forthcoming Australian Election Study says data shows three main reasons for the Greens‚Äô success in Brisbane in 2022. First young people are increasingly likely to vote for the Greens; second growing disaffection nationally with the major parties and declining levels of political partisanship (the Greens are the only exception) and third the impact of the Brisbane floods and the extra salience of climate change. Cameron who is a senior lecturer at Griffith University‚Äôs School of Government and International Relations says the youth vote was by far the most significant ‚Äì Brisbane Griffith and Ryan were three of the five federal electorates with the highest proportion of voters aged under 30 according to an ABC analysis.

‚ÄúIn the past young people have been further to the left of older people‚Äù says Cameron. ‚ÄúWhat we have seen with this current generation of young people is they are further to the left in comparison to previous generations when they were young.‚Äù

Research by academics Stewart Jackson and Josh Holloway suggests a cost-of-living emphasis was key to the party‚Äôs success in Queensland where top billing was given to policies such as free childcare free education and dental coverage in Medicare ‚Äì paid for by increased taxes on billionaires. That‚Äôs not to downplay the party‚Äôs resonance on climate change and the environmental issues: in the aftermath of the floods in Brisbane party volunteers delivered relief packages and worked on the clean-up. ‚ÄúIt created a context in which the Greens‚Äô messages on urgent climate action ‚Äì but also a broader point about the disconnect of the major parties from local communities ‚Äì were likely much more compelling‚Äù says Jackson who is a senior lecturer in government at the University of Sydney.

A key question for the Queensland Greens is whether the youthful activist politics personified by Jonathan Sri and federal MP Max Chandler-Mather ‚Äì who ran the party‚Äôs state campaigns in 2017 and 2020 ‚Äì will get traction.

Tiernan sees the possibility of a reckoning: ‚ÄúIf they are much more progressive than the constituents who shifted their votes to them this time that will quickly translate to a loss of support next time. Voters in Brisbane Griffith and Ryan are used to being represented by the parties of government. They are educated they have high expectations they‚Äôll be [giving] feedback all the time. I think if it starts to look like the agenda is very ideological or that they are not adopting [a] collaborative style ‚Ä¶ then that could present some risks.‚Äù

By contrast Sri wrote in his own post-election analysis that ‚Äúbold platforms based on taxing the mega-wealthy discouraging property investment and redistributing wealth towards social services and public facilities are extremely popular with the majority of voters.‚Äù

Sri says the Greens were ‚Äútalking openly and confidently about capping rents and scrapping negative gearing. This certainly put off a few property investors from voting for us but it also helped us win over heaps of people who were on the fence between Greens and Labor or indeed between Greens and the Liberals.‚Äù

Berkman agrees and points to recent state reforms to abortion law and voluntary assisted dying to argue politics is lagging behind public sentiment. ‚ÄúThe political establishment the two major parties are so far behind the kind of progress that the community broadly wants to see.‚Äù

He believes there is an appetite for redistributive social justice policies even in Liberal areas.

The new Greens member for Ryan Elizabeth Watson-Brown says voters are no longer swallowing what the conservative media says about the party. ‚ÄúA lot of the conservative voters in our electorate the people I spoke to were really interested in the very broad raft of things that the Greens have been talking about. There‚Äôs a lot of concern about affordable housing real interest in getting dental and mental cover into Medicare aged-care issues ‚Äì a whole raft of social things that the teals are just not talking about.‚Äù

As a long-term local resident senior professional and successful businesswoman Watson-Brown had some of the same appeal as the female teals just elected to the crossbench though she rejects this comparison. Now 65 she was arrested as a student activist in the bad old days of the corrupt Joh Bjelke-Petersen government.

‚ÄúWe were marching for the right to march‚Äù says Watson-Brown.

She retired from her award-winning architectural practice in 2018 and joined the Greens with absolutely no plan to run for office. She was inspired by working on Berkman‚Äôs re-election campaign and did a lot of doorknocking. ‚ÄúThe respect ‚Äì and the love I‚Äôd even say ‚Äì for him is very deep here‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been pretty powerful in terms of our success in Ryan as well.‚Äù

Watson-Brown also rejects attempts to describe her as a ‚Äúgreen-green‚Äù compared to ‚Äúred-greens‚Äù such as Sri or Chandler-Mather. She doesn‚Äôt see any such schism in the Queensland branch and is fully signed-up for the party‚Äôs ambitious policy agenda from climate to inequality.

The most senior Queensland Greens MP Larissa Waters describes her new parliamentary colleagues as a ‚Äúbeautiful blend‚Äù. The party‚Äôs success in May took southerners by surprise but at the grassroots level it was obvious the party was on a roll including in Liberal-held electorates. ‚ÄúPeople want a fair society‚Äù says Waters. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got kids!‚Äù

Waters will be joined in the senate by former state party convenor Penny Allman-Payne who is based out of Gladstone ‚Äì the first time that the Greens have had two senators from Queensland. That‚Äôs partly a consequence of the senate voting reform deal the Greens did with the Turnbull government in 2016 abolishing the ‚Äúpreference whispering‚Äù that often saw the last senate seat go to a micro party with a minuscule primary vote.

Nobody is taking the Greens wins for granted least of all the MPs themselves. Former Labor frontbencher Terri Butler who lost Griffith to Max Chandler-Mather bemoaned her opponent‚Äôs ‚Äúleft populism‚Äù and argued he was elected for making promises that he will find impossible to deliver on issues such as airport noise. Nevertheless the new MPs will want something to show their electors in Queensland ‚Äì now dubbed ‚ÄúGreensland‚Äù ‚Äì which has gone from being the party‚Äôs weakest state to its strongest with five of a record 16 federal MPs.

Sri says Brisbane plays a unique outsized role in the national political landscape sitting on an imagined boundary between regional Australia and the southern capitals. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not quite Sydney and Melbourne but we‚Äôre certainly not regional Queensland‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of this weird situation where Brisbane is sort of the tail wagging the Queensland dog and then Queensland is the tail wagging the Australian dog.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think if at some point there is a flip where we go from having a really conservative hard-right LNP-dominated Brisbane City Council to having a city council dominated by the Greens that will be a fundamental shift not just for the council but for Australian politics more generally because Brisbane is seen as this kind of pivot point for the entire country.‚Äù

After the May federal election the Queensland Greens are starting to dream big and their optimism and ambition are inspiring branches around the country.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve cracked something open here‚Äù says Watson-Brown in Ryan. She points to very similar constituencies in other Brisbane electorates including Lilley Bonner and even that of federal opposition leader Peter Dutton in Dickson which ranks among the Coalition‚Äôs most marginal seats and also rates as highly concerned about climate change.

Watson-Brown says the Queensland Greens are writing a new and different chapter in the history of the party ‚Äì a new dawn.

‚ÄúI think a lot of people have opened their hearts and minds to this and that is why I think that there‚Äôs a great future for the movement.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21vdG9yaW5nL21vdG9yaW5nLW5ld3MvYW1lcmljYW4tdG93aW5nLXRlc3QtZXhwb3Nlcy1mbGF3LWluLWVsZWN0cmljLXV0ZXMtb2YtdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS9uZXdzLXN0b3J5Lzc3MzI4ZWQzOWNlZTg5MDFmZjEyZTBhNTdiZmU2MjE20gGqAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbW90b3JpbmcvbW90b3JpbmctbmV3cy9hbWVyaWNhbi10b3dpbmctdGVzdC1leHBvc2VzLWZsYXctaW4tZWxlY3RyaWMtdXRlcy1vZi10aGUtZnV0dXJlL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNzczMjhlZDM5Y2VlODkwMWZmMTJlMGE1N2JmZTYyMTY_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New test exposes flaw in future utes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/motoring-news/american-towing-test-exposes-flaw-in-electric-utes-of-the-future/news-story/77328ed39cee8901ff12e0a57bfe6216 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21vdG9yaW5nL21vdG9yaW5nLW5ld3MvYW1lcmljYW4tdG93aW5nLXRlc3QtZXhwb3Nlcy1mbGF3LWluLWVsZWN0cmljLXV0ZXMtb2YtdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS9uZXdzLXN0b3J5Lzc3MzI4ZWQzOWNlZTg5MDFmZjEyZTBhNTdiZmU2MjE20gGqAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbW90b3JpbmcvbW90b3JpbmctbmV3cy9hbWVyaWNhbi10b3dpbmctdGVzdC1leHBvc2VzLWZsYXctaW4tZWxlY3RyaWMtdXRlcy1vZi10aGUtZnV0dXJlL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNzczMjhlZDM5Y2VlODkwMWZmMTJlMGE1N2JmZTYyMTY_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhY2VuZXQuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtYnVzaW5lc3NtYW4tZ2VycnktaGFydmV5LWJ1eXMtbWFqb3JpdHktc2hhcmUtaW4tYWxsaWdhdG9yLWJsb29kLTIwMjIwODE30gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmFjZW5ldC5jb20uYXUvYW1wL25ld3MvYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtYnVzaW5lc3NtYW4tZ2VycnktaGFydmV5LWJ1eXMtbWFqb3JpdHktc2hhcmUtaW4tYWxsaWdhdG9yLWJsb29kLTIwMjIwODE3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gerry Harvey swoops in to save Alligator Blood's spring carnival,"Alligator Blood has been given the green light to race in the Victorian spring racing carnival after billionaire businessman Gerry Harvey purchased a majority share of the headline horse.

With colourful owner Allan Endresz no longer in Alligator Blood's ownership News Corp can reveal it has paved the way for the Group 1 winner to race in the spring starting with the Group 1 Memsie Stakes at Caulfield on Saturday.

Alligator Blood will race in Harvey's blue and white racing colours.

Damien Oliver will ride Alligator Blood in the Group 1 Memsie on Saturday.

News Corp exclusively revealed recently that Magic Millions supremo and leviathan owner-breeder Harvey could buy some or all of Alligator Blood.

Alligator Blood was purchased by Endresz's Ezybonds No 1 Syndicate for $55000 from Harvey at the 2018 Gold Coast Yearling Sale.

News Corp understands Harvey has now purchased 60 per cent of Alligator Blood and the remaining 40 per cent is owned by Robyn and Jeff Simpson.

Endresz who had been barred from racing horses in Victoria and NSW due to his status as an undischarged bankrupt is no longer in the ownership of the two-time Group 1 winning star horse.

The Alligator Blood drama has dominated the early stages of the spring carnival with Endresz making several proposals to Racing Victoria in a bid to reverse their ban.

They were initially rejected but with Endresz no longer in the ownership Alligator Blood has been cleared for takeoff.

Alligator Blood gave co-trainer Gai Waterhouse her first Stradbroke Handicap win and her 150th Group 1 triumph earlier this year.

Adrian Bott who trains in partnership with Waterhouse said it was a relief to have the issue resolved.

""We are really looking forward to getting Alligator Blood back to the races and thankful for the support and opportunity from Gerry Harvey"" Bott said.

""Hopefully we can repay Gerry with a successful spring campaign. It's good to have certainty around the preparation now and we can put some more certain plans into place now.""

The change of ownership does not avert the legal stoush that Endresz will embark on against Racing Victoria ‚Äì it probably only exacerbates it.

Endresz who lost his terminally ill wife Joy on the day after Alligator Blood won the Stradbroke told News Corp: ""Selling the majority interest in Alligator Blood was a very emotional and tough decision for me to make.

""Alligator Blood means everything to me and my family.

""Alligator Blood will always be part of our lives with or without a financial interest.

""In loving memory of my wife Joy and in the interests of his legion of Blood Supporters this forced sale is the best possible outcome for Alligator Blood and racing.

""What's important is that Alligator Blood's love of racing and his ‚Äònever give up' spirit will continue on.

""This is something that Joy practised each and every day as she battled her terminal cancer.""

TAB added Alligator Blood to its Memsie Stakes all-in market at $8 after News Corp broke the news his ban had been lifted."

This quote is also an apt metaphor for a career that's seen the 57-year-old rise to the position of editor of News of the World at just 29 be sacked from rival tabloid the Daily Mirror for publishing fake photographs of British soldiers in Iraq - before securing a job on CNN in the U.S. - only to be axed three years into the deal in 2014 due to poor ratings.

He was then hired as Mail Online's editor-at-large where Morgan maintained his well-read column while stepping back onto television with a fulltime hosting role on Good Morning Britain.

In 2021 Morgan stormed off the set and out of the job after he was confronted on air about comments he made regarding Meghan Markle following her controversial Oprah interview with Prince Harry.

But just one year later Morgan finds himself under a new kind of pressure just six months after signing a monster $100million (AUD) deal with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

The word from Sky News' Sydney headquarters is 'Piers Morgan: Uncensored' - only launched in April - may ultimately be dumped from Australian screens due to poor ratings.

The show which premiered in the U.S. on Fox on the new British channel TVTalk and on Sky News in Australia initially attracted solid numbers on the back of a multi-million dollar advertising campaign and an interview with Donald Trump.

Piers Morgan's show is struggling in the ratings. He's pictured here with a cocktail in front of the Murdoch's private jet

Piers Morgan: Uncensored has sunk to a viewership of less than 100000 in the UK and 18000 in Australia

In Australia 90000 viewers tuned in to the first hour-long program which airs from Sunday to Thursday at 9pm.

However within just a few weeks those numbers had dropped significantly.

Shortly before Morgan's four-week long summer hiatus which he announced to his Twitter followers in late July Uncensored was drawing an average of just 18000 viewers in Australia.

It's a slide mirrored in the UK viewing figures which have dropped by about 80% since its debut - from 317000 to just 60000.

Morgan has featured a number of high-profile names on his show including Cristiano Ronaldo

Morgan's figures in Australia are dwarfed by his Sky News colleagues. Paul Murray's 'Paul Murray Live' regularly averages over 40000 viewers per night.

Credlin helmed by Tony Abbott's former chief of staff Peta Credlin also easily out-performed Uncensored with a 35000 nightly average.

For context Sky News' free-to-air prime-time rivals Seven News and Nine News average about 900000 viewers per night combined.

However Sky's top talent is watched widely on YouTube with some Australian hosts surprisingly popular in the U.S.

Now on a month-long break in the US where it's understood he is filming another season of his series Serial Killers 'Piers Morgan's Uncensored' is not being shown on Sky News' Australian schedule despite remaining on air in the UK under fill-in host Jeremy Kyle.

Most promotional images of Morgan have been quietly removed from the Sky News' website.

Morgan's relative failure comes with a degree of irony given he was supposed to be the big-name replacement for Alan Jones who was dumped by Sky News in November 2021 despite pulling an audience of 63000.

Lauded as Sky News' antidote to 'cancel culture' Morgan kicked off his series with a sit-down with Donald Trump.

'I'm going to cancel the cancel culture' he told Peta Credlin on Sky. 'I'm going to take those ultra woke lunatics head on.'

News Corp paid big money to promote the show (above is the ad near Sydney's Anzac Bridge)

Peta Credlin easily out-performed Uncensored with a 35000 nightly average.

Paul Murray remains the most popular figure on Sky News Australia despite earning a fraction of what Morgan is paid

Morgan boasted he would be 'calling out extremists from all sides not just in Australia but anywhere ‚Äì and especially those who think cancel culture's a great idea and want to compel us all to lead their own dreary joyless lifestyles'.

Morgan began what was a lavish promotional push in February when he arrived in Australia via Lachlan Murdoch's private jet to attend the 25th anniversary party of Sky News at the Sydney Opera House.

Discussing the upcoming election Morgan said he predicted Australians would 'elect the leader who they believe will move most swiftly to restore all freedom rights lost during the crisis and who will be strong on national security'.

Morgan's TV deal has a number of 'performance-based clauses' which allow News Corp to cut him loose say sources

Alan Jones made way for Morgan after he was dumped in November 2021

He later partied the night away with his new News Corp colleagues and followed it up with an appearance on Today opposite Karl Stefanovic (brother of Sky News breakfast anchor Peter Stefanovic) and Allison Langdon.

'Great to be back on breakfast TV again.. even if I did have to fly 10000 miles to find a morning show that would let me express my opinions!' he later tweeted.

But despite the international promotional push sources close to contract negotiations have told Daily Mail Australia that there were a number of 'performance-based' clauses built into Morgan's contract.

'Basically if the show doesn't rate it allows (News Corp) to exercise one or more of those clauses and end the contract without having to pay the full terms' said an insider.

'And it clearly isn't rating. So perhaps that's what Murdoch will now do.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Sky News Australia chief executive Paul Whittaker for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9saWZlc3R5bGUvaG9tZS90aGUtbmV3LWZpeGVyLXBydWUtbWlsbGVyLWdldHMteW91LW91dC1vZi1hLXN0aWNreS1zcG90L25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNzJjZmIzMWQyMTQ5ODE3MWU0MDk0ZWE4ZTFhMDEwMGbSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3cy5jb20uYXUvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2hvbWUvdGhlLW5ldy1maXhlci1wcnVlLW1pbGxlci1nZXRzLXlvdS1vdXQtb2YtYS1zdGlja3ktc3BvdC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzcyY2ZiMzFkMjE0OTgxNzFlNDA5NGVhOGUxYTAxMDBmP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The new Fixer: How to get out of a sticky spot,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/home/the-new-fixer-prue-miller-gets-you-out-of-a-sticky-spot/news-story/72cfb31d21498171e4094ea8e1a0100f on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9saWZlc3R5bGUvaG9tZS90aGUtbmV3LWZpeGVyLXBydWUtbWlsbGVyLWdldHMteW91LW91dC1vZi1hLXN0aWNreS1zcG90L25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNzJjZmIzMWQyMTQ5ODE3MWU0MDk0ZWE4ZTFhMDEwMGbSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3cy5jb20uYXUvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2hvbWUvdGhlLW5ldy1maXhlci1wcnVlLW1pbGxlci1nZXRzLXlvdS1vdXQtb2YtYS1zdGlja3ktc3BvdC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzcyY2ZiMzFkMjE0OTgxNzFlNDA5NGVhOGUxYTAxMDBmP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNhdHVyZGF5cGFwZXIuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9pbnNpZGUtcXVlZW5zbGFuZHMtZ3JlZW4td2F2ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Queensland's green wave,"In 2014 Jonathan Sriranganathan stood half-naked outside Queensland state parliament covered in body paint and unleashed a lyrical tirade against the government of Campbell Newman: ‚ÄúTwo-party system? Double the corruption!‚Äù Then he was shooting a video for his hip-hop band Rivermouth. But fast forward to 2022 and Jonno Sri as he is commonly known is perhaps as responsible as anyone for the ‚Äúgreenslide‚Äù that saw the Greens clinch three new inner-city seats in the house of representatives ‚Äì Ryan Griffith and Brisbane ‚Äì at the May election.

Most analysis of the Greens‚Äô success in Queensland has so far focused on the massive ground campaign in which hundreds of well-trained volunteers knocked on thousands of doors and the absence of ‚ÄúClimate 200‚Äù candidates. But it wasn‚Äôt just a one-off election campaign or an opportunistic response to this year‚Äôs floods or the lack of teals. The Greens have been making serious inroads in inner Brisbane for the past six years at least.

A Brisbane-born arts/law graduate of Tamil heritage Jonno Sri stood for the Greens in the Gabba ward of Brisbane‚Äôs City Council in 2016. He placed second with a primary vote of 32 per cent ‚Äì Labor preferences secured him the party‚Äôs first seat on the country‚Äôs most powerful local authority ‚Äì its first single-member electorate in Queensland. He moved out of his West End sharehouse onto a houseboat bought for $30000 so he could donate half of his $160000 annual salary to charity. He shot to national prominence wearing a rainbow scarf to his biggest press conference in 2017 standing alongside a tearful Senator Larissa Waters who had become the state‚Äôs first elected Greens politician in 2010 but resigned after discovering she was a dual citizen. Sri would go on to win re-election in Gabba in 2020 with a 13 per cent swing to him lifting his two-party margin above 62 per cent. Now Sri believes the lord mayoralty is winnable: ‚ÄúEvery election the major parties‚Äô vote in Brisbane is dropping and the Greens vote is rising and we‚Äôre at the point now where the Greens vote is going to be high enough that we could conceivably win the mayoralty in March 2024 along with half a dozen wards.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe political establishment the two major parties are so far behind the kind of progress that the community broadly wants to see.‚Äù

Sri‚Äôs success in the Gabba established a beachhead for the Greens in inner Brisbane. It was followed by another narrow win for environmental lawyer Michael Berkman in the Liberal-held state seat of Maiwar in 2017. Like Sri he squeaked into second place and Labor preferences helped make him the first Green elected to Queensland‚Äôs unicameral parliament ‚Äì for decades an unassailable barrier for the minor party. A 12 per cent swing towards Berkman won him re-election in 2020 and Amy MacMahon took the neighbouring seat of South Brisbane which closely matches the boundaries of the Gabba ward. Maiwar and South Brisbane fall within the federal electorates of Ryan and Griffith respectively and Sri has no doubt that the Greens‚Äô local and state wins paved the way for the breakthrough in May.

‚ÄúIn Brisbane people have had really positive experiences of Greens reps at the local and state level‚Äù Sri says. ‚ÄúThey see that we‚Äôre effective they see that we‚Äôre responsive and that makes it a lot easier to convince people to vote for us at the federal level too. Word of mouth does matter.‚Äù

Environmental activist and historian Drew Hutton who co-founded the Brisbane Greens in 1984 and ran for lord mayor the following year wholeheartedly agrees. Hutton stood for the Greens six times over the next 23 years lifting the primary vote around the West End stronghold from nothing to a career-best 26 per cent in his 2008 campaign for the Gabba ward. Barnaby Joyce narrowly beat him for the last senate seat in 2004. Bob Brown who co-founded the Australian Greens with Hutton 30 years ago describes him as ‚Äúthe best senator Queensland never had‚Äù.

Now 75 and retired Hutton has been critical of the Greens. In a controversial Facebook post at the end of last year he said he feared the party had ‚Äúlocked themselves into a middle class inner city tertiary educated identity politics-driven ghetto‚Äù and called for more spokespeople like Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie. But Hutton is a big fan of Sri describing his win in Gabba as a ‚Äúmajor breakthrough ‚Ä¶ I doubt if the business community likes Jonno too much but young people love him‚Äù.

Hutton sees Sri as a fellow traveller ‚Äì a campaigning Green. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a bit of a tendency to overthink in the Greens and to fall back on ideology and policy instead of realising that you‚Äôve actually got to get out there and convert those ideas into the lived reality of people.‚Äù

Sri has never worn a suit into Brisbane City Hall and says he probably never will but there‚Äôs much more to his brand of politics than his colourful outfits and his performances with Rivermouth or ska punk band the Mouldy Lovers. Sri believes strongly in grassroots democracy and one of his first moves as councillor was an exercise in participatory budgeting giving Gabba residents discretionary control over a $400000 budget for park upgrades.

Sri is routinely outvoted on the Liberal National Party-dominated council: in 2019 he failed to get up a climate emergency declaration and last year he was the only Brisbane councillor to vote against the city‚Äôs successful bid for the 2032 Olympics which he says will be unsustainable and will ‚Äúturbocharge gentrification‚Äù.

But he was the first councillor to call for the conversion of golf courses to public green space. Three years later the council announced the 18-hole Victoria Park golf course would close and make way for Brisbane‚Äôs biggest park in half a century.

Sri deliberately blurs the line between activism and politics. In 2018 when a mum with five children faced eviction from public housing Sri jumped on Facebook to organise a blockade to meet the police. The woman kept her home. Two months ago Sri and Michael Berkman helped stop another eviction this time of a disability pensioner. Sri went so far as to lock himself on to the front-door flyscreen. When the police came back a few days later so did the blockaders and the Housing Department backed down.

The Greens were born out of civil disobedience and Sri is part of that tradition acknowledging that ‚Äúactually I‚Äôve never been lawfully arrested so in some ways probably my record is a little bit cleaner than someone like Bob Brown on that front.‚Äù In 2020 he was arrested while protesting against the relocation of asylum seekers at a Kangaroo Point hotel to high-security detention and charged with failing to heed a police direction to leave. The charges were dropped days later due to lack of evidence. Sri believes some of the depiction of his forthright activism is racialised and cites the media treatment of Victorian Greens senator Lidia Thorpe who described the Queen as a ‚Äúcoloniser‚Äù in her swearing-in ceremony this month. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen some of the commentary about Lidia being too assertive or too forceful‚Äù says Sri ‚Äúwhen actually she‚Äôs saying and doing the same sorts of things as a lot of other Greens representatives but it‚Äôs just experienced differently by middle-class white people because they feel attacked when a First Nations person or a person of colour is highlighting fundamental injustices of the system.‚Äù

Michael Berkman likes to think he‚Äôs replicated Sri‚Äôs approach in Maiwar. He has focused heavily on local issues such as campaigning against a proposal to build six zip-lines down Mount Coot-tha stopping 43 new poker machines at the local pub and pushing for a new primary school at Toowong.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned more from Jonno ‚Äì about how to be an effective and useful local representative ‚Äì than anyone else just because he was the first in that local electorate-based representative role here in Queensland and he‚Äôs done a phenomenal job of it‚Äù he says.

He‚Äôs speaking after a week of estimates hearings he describes as ‚Äúfarcical‚Äù. In Queensland where all seven portfolio committees are government-chaired and only hold one day of hearings each year Berkman says opposition or crossbench MPs can barely ask a question.

‚ÄúThe chairs will very routinely just shut down lines of questioning whenever it gets uncomfortable based on spurious points of order‚Äù says Berkman who sits on the community services committee. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a joke ‚Ä¶ almost worse than nothing because it creates this impression of accountability that just doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

If the Greens‚Äô wins at local and state level set the scene for the party‚Äôs federal victories they were hardly assured. Political scientist Anne Tiernan who is an adjunct professor at Griffith University‚Äôs business school admits she is ‚Äúa bit surprised‚Äù that the Greens have emerged as such a force in Queensland. Going into the election she thought LNP voters might worry about Greens candidates in Brisbane ‚Äútaking instructions from inner-city Melbourne after the caravan debacle of 2019‚Äù.

Tiernan says many well-paid professionals in inner-city Brisbane derive income from the state‚Äôs huge coal and gas exports and did not take well to the Bob Brown Foundation‚Äôs Stop Adani convoy from Hobart to north Queensland ahead of the 2019 election. After Scott Morrison‚Äôs upset victory and as progressives joked about ‚ÄúQuexit‚Äù Tiernan challenged stereotypes of the state‚Äôs voters as deeply conservative ‚Äì the Newman government aside they‚Äôve elected Labor state governments since the Nationals wipeout in 1989.

In 2022 she says the Queensland Greens took a less confrontational approach to the climate campaign. ‚ÄúI think that tells you something about the federated structure of the [Greens] party‚Äù says Tiernan. ‚ÄúObviously the state organisation was much more attuned to that risk and able to assuage some of those concerns.‚Äù

Bob Brown rejects the criticism of the Adani convoy saying it boosted the Greens vote which jumped 3 percentage points to almost 10 per cent in the senate. That ensured Larissa Waters was re-elected which was critical to the party‚Äôs success the next time around. He says it‚Äôs wrong to suggest that ‚Äúoutsiders mustn‚Äôt talk about coal and gas in Queensland ‚Äì come on it‚Äôs not very brave‚Äù.

Climate Action Network Australia co-ordinator Dr Barry Traill rejects the argument that Labor lost the 2019 Queensland election because of coal. That case was first made by then Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce he says and parroted by the media but is not borne out by the data. Climate concern was prevalent among voters according to Traill but not yet enough to swing seats with the exception of Zali Steggall‚Äôs win in the Sydney seat of Warringah.

‚ÄúClimate mattered last time‚Äù he says adding that voter concern increased through fires and floods. ‚ÄúThis time it just went to the next step.‚Äù

Dr Sarah Cameron a chief investigator for the forthcoming Australian Election Study says data shows three main reasons for the Greens‚Äô success in Brisbane in 2022. First young people are increasingly likely to vote for the Greens; second growing disaffection nationally with the major parties and declining levels of political partisanship (the Greens are the only exception) and third the impact of the Brisbane floods and the extra salience of climate change. Cameron who is a senior lecturer at Griffith University‚Äôs School of Government and International Relations says the youth vote was by far the most significant ‚Äì Brisbane Griffith and Ryan were three of the five federal electorates with the highest proportion of voters aged under 30 according to an ABC analysis.

‚ÄúIn the past young people have been further to the left of older people‚Äù says Cameron. ‚ÄúWhat we have seen with this current generation of young people is they are further to the left in comparison to previous generations when they were young.‚Äù

Research by academics Stewart Jackson and Josh Holloway suggests a cost-of-living emphasis was key to the party‚Äôs success in Queensland where top billing was given to policies such as free childcare free education and dental coverage in Medicare ‚Äì paid for by increased taxes on billionaires. That‚Äôs not to downplay the party‚Äôs resonance on climate change and the environmental issues: in the aftermath of the floods in Brisbane party volunteers delivered relief packages and worked on the clean-up. ‚ÄúIt created a context in which the Greens‚Äô messages on urgent climate action ‚Äì but also a broader point about the disconnect of the major parties from local communities ‚Äì were likely much more compelling‚Äù says Jackson who is a senior lecturer in government at the University of Sydney.

A key question for the Queensland Greens is whether the youthful activist politics personified by Jonathan Sri and federal MP Max Chandler-Mather ‚Äì who ran the party‚Äôs state campaigns in 2017 and 2020 ‚Äì will get traction.

Tiernan sees the possibility of a reckoning: ‚ÄúIf they are much more progressive than the constituents who shifted their votes to them this time that will quickly translate to a loss of support next time. Voters in Brisbane Griffith and Ryan are used to being represented by the parties of government. They are educated they have high expectations they‚Äôll be [giving] feedback all the time. I think if it starts to look like the agenda is very ideological or that they are not adopting [a] collaborative style ‚Ä¶ then that could present some risks.‚Äù

By contrast Sri wrote in his own post-election analysis that ‚Äúbold platforms based on taxing the mega-wealthy discouraging property investment and redistributing wealth towards social services and public facilities are extremely popular with the majority of voters.‚Äù

Sri says the Greens were ‚Äútalking openly and confidently about capping rents and scrapping negative gearing. This certainly put off a few property investors from voting for us but it also helped us win over heaps of people who were on the fence between Greens and Labor or indeed between Greens and the Liberals.‚Äù

Berkman agrees and points to recent state reforms to abortion law and voluntary assisted dying to argue politics is lagging behind public sentiment. ‚ÄúThe political establishment the two major parties are so far behind the kind of progress that the community broadly wants to see.‚Äù

He believes there is an appetite for redistributive social justice policies even in Liberal areas.

The new Greens member for Ryan Elizabeth Watson-Brown says voters are no longer swallowing what the conservative media says about the party. ‚ÄúA lot of the conservative voters in our electorate the people I spoke to were really interested in the very broad raft of things that the Greens have been talking about. There‚Äôs a lot of concern about affordable housing real interest in getting dental and mental cover into Medicare aged-care issues ‚Äì a whole raft of social things that the teals are just not talking about.‚Äù

As a long-term local resident senior professional and successful businesswoman Watson-Brown had some of the same appeal as the female teals just elected to the crossbench though she rejects this comparison. Now 65 she was arrested as a student activist in the bad old days of the corrupt Joh Bjelke-Petersen government.

‚ÄúWe were marching for the right to march‚Äù says Watson-Brown.

She retired from her award-winning architectural practice in 2018 and joined the Greens with absolutely no plan to run for office. She was inspired by working on Berkman‚Äôs re-election campaign and did a lot of doorknocking. ‚ÄúThe respect ‚Äì and the love I‚Äôd even say ‚Äì for him is very deep here‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been pretty powerful in terms of our success in Ryan as well.‚Äù

Watson-Brown also rejects attempts to describe her as a ‚Äúgreen-green‚Äù compared to ‚Äúred-greens‚Äù such as Sri or Chandler-Mather. She doesn‚Äôt see any such schism in the Queensland branch and is fully signed-up for the party‚Äôs ambitious policy agenda from climate to inequality.

The most senior Queensland Greens MP Larissa Waters describes her new parliamentary colleagues as a ‚Äúbeautiful blend‚Äù. The party‚Äôs success in May took southerners by surprise but at the grassroots level it was obvious the party was on a roll including in Liberal-held electorates. ‚ÄúPeople want a fair society‚Äù says Waters. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got kids!‚Äù

Waters will be joined in the senate by former state party convenor Penny Allman-Payne who is based out of Gladstone ‚Äì the first time that the Greens have had two senators from Queensland. That‚Äôs partly a consequence of the senate voting reform deal the Greens did with the Turnbull government in 2016 abolishing the ‚Äúpreference whispering‚Äù that often saw the last senate seat go to a micro party with a minuscule primary vote.

Nobody is taking the Greens wins for granted least of all the MPs themselves. Former Labor frontbencher Terri Butler who lost Griffith to Max Chandler-Mather bemoaned her opponent‚Äôs ‚Äúleft populism‚Äù and argued he was elected for making promises that he will find impossible to deliver on issues such as airport noise. Nevertheless the new MPs will want something to show their electors in Queensland ‚Äì now dubbed ‚ÄúGreensland‚Äù ‚Äì which has gone from being the party‚Äôs weakest state to its strongest with five of a record 16 federal MPs.

Sri says Brisbane plays a unique outsized role in the national political landscape sitting on an imagined boundary between regional Australia and the southern capitals. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not quite Sydney and Melbourne but we‚Äôre certainly not regional Queensland‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of this weird situation where Brisbane is sort of the tail wagging the Queensland dog and then Queensland is the tail wagging the Australian dog.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think if at some point there is a flip where we go from having a really conservative hard-right LNP-dominated Brisbane City Council to having a city council dominated by the Greens that will be a fundamental shift not just for the council but for Australian politics more generally because Brisbane is seen as this kind of pivot point for the entire country.‚Äù

After the May federal election the Queensland Greens are starting to dream big and their optimism and ambition are inspiring branches around the country.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve cracked something open here‚Äù says Watson-Brown in Ryan. She points to very similar constituencies in other Brisbane electorates including Lilley Bonner and even that of federal opposition leader Peter Dutton in Dickson which ranks among the Coalition‚Äôs most marginal seats and also rates as highly concerned about climate change.

Watson-Brown says the Queensland Greens are writing a new and different chapter in the history of the party ‚Äì a new dawn.

‚ÄúI think a lot of people have opened their hearts and minds to this and that is why I think that there‚Äôs a great future for the movement.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21vdG9yaW5nL21vdG9yaW5nLW5ld3MvYW1lcmljYW4tdG93aW5nLXRlc3QtZXhwb3Nlcy1mbGF3LWluLWVsZWN0cmljLXV0ZXMtb2YtdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS9uZXdzLXN0b3J5Lzc3MzI4ZWQzOWNlZTg5MDFmZjEyZTBhNTdiZmU2MjE20gGqAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbW90b3JpbmcvbW90b3JpbmctbmV3cy9hbWVyaWNhbi10b3dpbmctdGVzdC1leHBvc2VzLWZsYXctaW4tZWxlY3RyaWMtdXRlcy1vZi10aGUtZnV0dXJlL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNzczMjhlZDM5Y2VlODkwMWZmMTJlMGE1N2JmZTYyMTY_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New test exposes flaw in future utes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/motoring-news/american-towing-test-exposes-flaw-in-electric-utes-of-the-future/news-story/77328ed39cee8901ff12e0a57bfe6216 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21vdG9yaW5nL21vdG9yaW5nLW5ld3MvYW1lcmljYW4tdG93aW5nLXRlc3QtZXhwb3Nlcy1mbGF3LWluLWVsZWN0cmljLXV0ZXMtb2YtdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS9uZXdzLXN0b3J5Lzc3MzI4ZWQzOWNlZTg5MDFmZjEyZTBhNTdiZmU2MjE20gGqAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbW90b3JpbmcvbW90b3JpbmctbmV3cy9hbWVyaWNhbi10b3dpbmctdGVzdC1leHBvc2VzLWZsYXctaW4tZWxlY3RyaWMtdXRlcy1vZi10aGUtZnV0dXJlL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNzczMjhlZDM5Y2VlODkwMWZmMTJlMGE1N2JmZTYyMTY_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhY2VuZXQuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtYnVzaW5lc3NtYW4tZ2VycnktaGFydmV5LWJ1eXMtbWFqb3JpdHktc2hhcmUtaW4tYWxsaWdhdG9yLWJsb29kLTIwMjIwODE30gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmFjZW5ldC5jb20uYXUvYW1wL25ld3MvYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtYnVzaW5lc3NtYW4tZ2VycnktaGFydmV5LWJ1eXMtbWFqb3JpdHktc2hhcmUtaW4tYWxsaWdhdG9yLWJsb29kLTIwMjIwODE3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gerry Harvey swoops in to save Alligator Blood's spring carnival,"Alligator Blood has been given the green light to race in the Victorian spring racing carnival after billionaire businessman Gerry Harvey purchased a majority share of the headline horse.

With colourful owner Allan Endresz no longer in Alligator Blood's ownership News Corp can reveal it has paved the way for the Group 1 winner to race in the spring starting with the Group 1 Memsie Stakes at Caulfield on Saturday.

Alligator Blood will race in Harvey's blue and white racing colours.

Damien Oliver will ride Alligator Blood in the Group 1 Memsie on Saturday.

News Corp exclusively revealed recently that Magic Millions supremo and leviathan owner-breeder Harvey could buy some or all of Alligator Blood.

Alligator Blood was purchased by Endresz's Ezybonds No 1 Syndicate for $55000 from Harvey at the 2018 Gold Coast Yearling Sale.

News Corp understands Harvey has now purchased 60 per cent of Alligator Blood and the remaining 40 per cent is owned by Robyn and Jeff Simpson.

Endresz who had been barred from racing horses in Victoria and NSW due to his status as an undischarged bankrupt is no longer in the ownership of the two-time Group 1 winning star horse.

The Alligator Blood drama has dominated the early stages of the spring carnival with Endresz making several proposals to Racing Victoria in a bid to reverse their ban.

They were initially rejected but with Endresz no longer in the ownership Alligator Blood has been cleared for takeoff.

Alligator Blood gave co-trainer Gai Waterhouse her first Stradbroke Handicap win and her 150th Group 1 triumph earlier this year.

Adrian Bott who trains in partnership with Waterhouse said it was a relief to have the issue resolved.

""We are really looking forward to getting Alligator Blood back to the races and thankful for the support and opportunity from Gerry Harvey"" Bott said.

""Hopefully we can repay Gerry with a successful spring campaign. It's good to have certainty around the preparation now and we can put some more certain plans into place now.""

Allan Endresz (centre) with Robyn and Jeff Simpson said selling his majority interest in Alligator Blood was a very tough decision. Picture: Steve Holland

The change of ownership does not avert the legal stoush that Endresz will embark on against Racing Victoria ‚Äì it probably only exacerbates it.

Endresz who lost his terminally ill wife Joy on the day after Alligator Blood won the Stradbroke told News Corp: ""Selling the majority interest in Alligator Blood was a very emotional and tough decision for me to make.

""Alligator Blood means everything to me and my family.

""Alligator Blood will always be part of our lives with or without a financial interest.

""In loving memory of my wife Joy and in the interests of his legion of Blood Supporters this forced sale is the best possible outcome for Alligator Blood and racing.

""What's important is that Alligator Blood's love of racing and his ‚Äònever give up' spirit will continue on.

""This is something that Joy practised each and every day as she battled her terminal cancer.""

TAB added Alligator Blood to its Memsie Stakes all-in market at $8 after News Corp broke the news his ban had been lifted."

The treatment plant is the centerpiece of the township's sewer system which a Florida company NextEra Water has agreed to buy for $115.3 million. Read more

Towamencin Township a suburban Montgomery County community with a population of about 18000 received bids in February from five suitors to acquire its municipal sewer system. The offers left township supervisors breathless.

Pennsylvania American Water the state‚Äôs largest private water utility offered to pay $92.4 million for the township‚Äôs system about 71% more than the bid of its principal rival Aqua Pennsylvania the state‚Äôs second largest water utility.

But the real shock was a bid from NextEra Water a Florida company that owns no other Pennsylvania water utilities. It offered to pay Towamencin $115.3 million for its wastewater system ‚Äî 25% more than Pennsylvania American Water and more than double Aqua‚Äôs bid of $54.1 million.

‚ÄúWhen we received two bids over $90 million to say I was surprised would be an understatement‚Äù Supervisor Richard Marino told a town hall meeting in April.

The NextEra offer of $115.3 million was ‚Äútotally out of line with what we thought we would receive‚Äù H. Charles Wilson III the chairman of the township‚Äôs board of supervisors said at the meeting. NextEra‚Äôs offer for the sewer system amounts to nearly eight times the township‚Äôs entire annual operating budget of $15 million.

The supervisors said the sale of the sewer system and its 7500 accounts to NextEra would allow Towamencin to retire its debt forestall property tax increases finance some projects immediately and stash $87 million in the bank. Future township improvements would be funded just from the interest earned on the $87 million reserve. Marino called the sale ‚Äúa generational opportunity to reboot and reset our finances for the foreseeable future.‚Äù

The township supervisors voted 4-1 in May to accept the NextEra bid over vocal objections of residents who fear that homeowners and businesses will pay higher sewer rates to cover NextEra‚Äôs elevated purchase price. The opponents are organizing a ballot campaign to rewrite the town‚Äôs charter to block the sewer system sale and reverse the ‚Äúbackdoor tax increase‚Äù on sewer customers.

Regardless of the final resolution of Towamencin‚Äôs political turmoil the sale process has been a stunning debut for NextEra Water a new player with deep pockets in the competition to buy up Pennsylvania‚Äôs fragmented municipal water and wastewater systems.

NextEra Water is a subsidiary of NextEra Energy of Juno Beach Fla. an infrastructure firm whose principal asset is an electric utility Florida Power and Light. It also owns a large portfolio of renewable energy assets.

‚ÄòThe largest company you‚Äôve never heard of‚Äô

NextEra Energy is sometimes called ‚Äúthe largest company that you‚Äôve never heard of‚Äù Bruce Hauk the president of NextEra Water said during an introductory meeting with Towamencin residents in April.

Though NextEra says it is an experienced operator of wastewater systems at its own power plants it began to explore expanding into water utilities only in the last year.

The frenzy to consolidate systems in Pennsylvania has been spurred by a 2016 state law Act 12 which has revolutionized the privatization process by incentivizing the sale of water and wastewater systems at ‚Äúfair market‚Äù prices which can be much higher than the actual book value of the assets.

Until recently the competition in Pennsylvania has largely been dominated by the nation‚Äôs two biggest investor-owned water companies both headquartered in the Philadelphia area: American Water Works Co. Inc. based in Camden and Aqua America a subsidiary of Essential Utilities Inc. of Bryn Mawr. Both are experienced at navigating the region‚Äôs political and regulatory systems vital skills for public utilities whose operations require close cooperation with government.

But private equity funds are showing heightened interest in buying municipal utilities which require ever more capital to replace aging infrastructure and to respond to new climate and environmental challenges such as contamination by compounds known as PFAS. Unlike some other states that have enacted legislation that allow only fair-market acquisitions of distressed municipal utilities Pennsylvania‚Äôs Act 12 legislation can make it attractive for any town to sell at a high price.

‚ÄúYou can really go after any system in Pennsylvania‚Äù said an investment analyst who follows the industry and was not authorized to speak publicly. ‚ÄúThat really makes the big guys open to the market. Plus Pennsylvania has scale ‚Äî it‚Äôs a large state with a lot of opportunity.‚Äù

Several investment firms have recently entered the Pennsylvania market primarily focused on leasing and not buying municipal systems which they would operate through contractors.

VICO Infrastructure a California venture that works in partnership with the the private equity giant Carlyle Group was a distant bidder in the Towamencin process. And Bernhard Capital Partners of Baton Rouge La. has been active in bidding for leases in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

NextEra Water also tried to bid for the Bucks County Water and Sewer Authority recently but was rebuffed when BCWSA last month awarded Aqua Pennsylvania the right to finalize a $1.1 billion offer for its sewer system. Bucks officials said they favored operators with a Pennsylvania track record.

Recouping $115.3 million

The question of how NextEra would recover its $115.3 million purchase price from Towamencin‚Äôs 7500 customers and the impact on rates was a central issue raised by opponents of the sale.

Christopher H. Franklin the chairman of Essential Utilities told investment analysts in October that an established water utility such as Aqua has an advantage because it can spread the cost of acquisitions and improvements across an existing customer base of nearly 500000 customers in Pennsylvania.

But a company such as NextEra which has 5.7 million electric customers in Florida can‚Äôt pass on the costs of its Pennsylvania water utility acquisitions to Florida ratepayers. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt spread their water costs on their electric customers‚Äù said Franklin said. ‚ÄúSo they‚Äôve still got to confine any rate increases for acquisitions on those customers they have.‚Äù

NextEra‚Äôs Hauk said the company did not plan to recover the full price in rates. The amount it could recover would be set by Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission based on fair-market appraisals if the sale were approved.

It seems clear to most observers that NextEra is paying an above-market price for the Towamencin system to establish a base upon which it can expand in Pennsylvania by buying other systems.

‚ÄúSometimes companies will do that to penetrate the market get their foot in the door and are fully aware that they‚Äôre probably not going to get the return on investment and recover the full 115‚Ä≥ million dollars said Supervisor Marino a contractor by trade.

Aqua ‚Äònot too worried‚Äô as NextEra expands

NextEra last year signaled its broader interest in water utilities when it announced the acquisition of a portfolio of 23 water and five wastewater utility systems in several counties surrounding Houston. The deal with Quadvest L.P. another private investor closed last month. The purchase price was undisclosed.

Rebecca Kujawa NextEra‚Äôs chief financial officer told investment analysts in October that the acquisition of the Texas properties reflected the company‚Äôs plans to create a national water utility.

‚ÄúThe proposed acquisition expands our regulated utility business in an attractive market with significant expected customer growth and furthers our strategy to build a world class water utility in the coming years‚Äù Kujawa said. ‚ÄúWe are optimistic about the strong growth anticipated in this new market and the potential for clean water solutions to generate additional contracted renewables opportunities going forward.‚Äù

Some analysts are impressed by NextEra‚Äôs expansion into water.

‚ÄúThis move provides the company with huge growth potential as the U.S. water and wastewater utility industry is highly fragmented‚Äù the Motley Fool investment advisory service said in a June blog post. ‚ÄúNextEra‚Äôs considerable financial resources give its NextEra Water subsidiary the potential to be a formidable player.‚Äù

The activity of a giant such as NextEra also did not go unnoticed in the corporate suite of Essential Utilities in Bryn Mawr. NextEra‚Äôs market valuation of $179 billion is about 13 times the market capitalization of Essential Utilities. NextEra had $17 billion in revenue last year three times the combined sales of the two Philadelphia area water companies Essential Utilities and American Water.

Franklin the chairman of Essential Utilities told analysts last year that Aqua welcomed NextEra and was ‚Äúnot too worried about‚Äù the competition.

‚ÄúAs we think about this privatization trend the more that occurs successfully the better it is‚Äù Franklin said. ‚ÄúWe think this is a pretty big market. We‚Äôve certainly been successful in our market share and we think we can continue to do that.‚Äù

A big customer objects

NextEra said it would operate the Towamencin system through a contractor U.S. Water Services Corp. an unaffiliated Florida company.

The township‚Äôs adviser on the sale Public Financial Management Inc. (PFM) projected the township‚Äôs future sewer rates if the township retained the system compared with rates under private ownership adjusted to reflect the amount each household would save in reduced property taxes if the township banked the sewer sale proceeds. PFM projected that township residents would be better off if the township sold the system.

PFM‚Äôs projections were met with skepticism by opponents who argue that PFM is not an impartial adviser: The firm stands to earn an $807000 fee ‚Äî 0.7% of the sale price ‚Äî if the deal closes next year. If there is no sale PFM makes a $9500 fee.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe the numbers that have been shown throughout the presentations are accurate‚Äù said James Lee general counsel of the Clemens Food Group the makers of Hatfield meats whose processing facility in neighboring Hatfield Township is the largest customer on the Towamencin wastewater system.

The meat producer estimates that its annual sewer fees would double to $1.6 million if the sale went through ‚Äúwhich will significantly impact our operations in Hatfield‚Äù Lee said at the April town hall. He warned the township that Clemens is ‚Äúlooking at all options to either reduce or eliminate our flow‚Äù to Towamencin should the sale go through.

In the end the township supervisors were unmoved by the opposition calling the sale a ‚Äúno brainer.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge plus for the community to be able to pay off all the debt create space in the annual operating budget to do other initiatives and to meet future increase in costs‚Äù said Wilson the chairman of the board.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljYWdvdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9zb2xhci1wcm9qZWN0LXBsYW5uZWQtZm9yLWZhcm1sYW5kLWluLXNvdXRoZXJuLXBvcnRlci1jb3VudHktYnV0LWRldmVsb3BlcnMtYXJlLW11bS1vbi13aGljaC1mYXJtZXJzLXdpbGwtcGFydGljaXBhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar project planned for farmland in southern Porter County but developers are mum on which farmers will participate,"Matt Sheafer farms around 900 acres in Kankakee Township in Jasper County in corn and soybeans in what he described as ‚Äúa typical Indiana farm.‚Äù

Sheafer who‚Äôs been farming outside of Wheatfield for 10 years and farmed for 20 years in Crown Point before that will soon house a different crop that relies on the sun to produce a yield: solar panels.

‚ÄúApproximately one-third of our ground is going to go into solar and I‚Äôm going to farm around it‚Äù Sheafer said on a recent morning.

The soil in Jasper County is sandy he said and every year his crops get stressed because of drought. He uses a no-till method for farming strip intercropping alternating sections of corn and soybeans to maximize the amount of sunlight each crop receives.

‚ÄúI kept the better ground to farm. The land that‚Äôs less productive is going into solar‚Äù he said adding he looks at farming as an investment. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just maximizing your return on that lesser ground.‚Äù

NextEra Energy Resources is proposing a $250 million investment in Porter County through its Malden Solar project with an estimated $52 million coming back to the county over the life of the project an estimated 35 years.

The project still in its preliminary stages has yet to receive approval from the county though NextEra is expected to ask for a tax abatement or other incentives for bringing the project here.

NextEra officials are mum on several aspects of the proposal including who the farmers are so far who have agreed to lease their property for solar array panels or the exact location of where the panels will go other than to say it includes land on either side of Smoke Road.

They did confirm that around nine farmers have signed on so far with another few possibly agreeing to lease their land. They also declined to identify who the farmers who signed prospective leases are unless the names are released during a public meeting or how much revenue they can expect to receive.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right there along Smoke Road. That‚Äôs the meridian line‚Äù said Matt Johnson developer of the project for NextEra Energy adding 80% to 90% of the land has been secured through lease agreements at about 1800 acres with the possibility of an additional 160 to 800 acres.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs safe to say we have a project in Porter County‚Äù added Zachary Melda development director for NextEra who is based in Juno Beach Florida the company headquarters.

Dunns Bridge Solar in Jasper County

NextEra on its company website touts itself as ‚Äúthe world leader in electricity generated from wind and solar‚Äù with $135 billion in total assets.

On a recent morning officials from NextEra and Northern Indiana Public Service Company which is harvesting the wattage generated by the Dunns Bridge project offered a tour of the Jasper County work in progress in Kankakee Township near Wheatfield visiting different parcels of land in varying stages of completion.

That included parcels with solar array panels fully installed and others that had only the metal racks upon which they connect all secured behind chain link fencing. NIPSCO‚Äôs R.M. Schahfer Generating Station which is being shut down was visible in the distance.

The Porter County project is expected to be similar in size and scope to the first phase of Dunns Bridge Solar which should be finished by May of next year. The second phase of that project which stretches into nearby Starke County is expected to be complete in December 2024.

‚ÄúJasper County was always in a different position than what the Malden project would be‚Äù said Stephen Eastridge executive director of the Jasper County Economic Development Organization.

The Schahfer Generating Station is being shut down in stages and is expected to be out of service around 2025 according to NIPSCO communications manager Tara McElmurry. Dunns Bridge Solar she said is just one of the utility‚Äôs projects as the company moves away from coal to renewable energy.

The generating station Eastridge said provided almost 20% of Jasper County‚Äôs tax base when he started his job there in 2017.

‚ÄúThat retirement was a really big blow to our local government bodies‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe had real concerns about our tax base and tax rate jumps.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs where Dunns Bridge Solar comes in. The Indiana legislature sets the value of agricultural property at $1250 per acre where the solar panels are going in Eastridge said. That will go up considerably with solar.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about $13000 per acre once it‚Äôs put in solar use‚Äù he said.

(Andy Lavalley for the Post-Tribune)

The Jasper County Council according to minutes from a March 19 2019 meeting approved a declining seven-year tax abatement for the first phase of Dunns Bridge Solar. The abatement approved unanimously by the county council has the county abating $1.4 million from a tax bill of a little more than $2 million.

By the seventh year Eastridge said NextEra will be paying its full tax liability.

The project according to the meeting minutes is expected to generate $35 million for landowners over 30 years. The estimated tax benefit to the county is projected at $24.5 million on a $300 million solar investment. Estimated annual revenue for the Kankakee Valley School Corporation is $660000 annually with other taxing units in the county benefiting as well.

Renewable energy in general is a hot topic Eastridge said and the project hasn‚Äôt gone without its critics.

‚ÄúThe biggest thing we come back to is ‚ÄòHow does this impact my life? What am I going to look at when I leave my driveway?'‚Äù he said adding that makes up about 90% of the concerns he hears in the community.

The project can‚Äôt be stopped on that Eastridge said adding he also hears what he calls rumors based on bad science about chemicals from the solar panels leaching into the ground. People also talk about the loss of farmland.

‚ÄúMy counter argument to that is at the end of the day if it didn‚Äôt make financial sense it wouldn‚Äôt happen‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is some of the least productive land we have in Jasper County.‚Äù

Additionally he said farmers can continue farming the rest of their acreage while reaping the financial benefits of solar income that can be spent on equipment farm outbuildings and the like and invested back into the local economy.

‚ÄúNo matter what your opinion of solar or renewables is people still want power to plug their phones in‚Äù Eastridge said.

If or when the time comes that solar energy is no longer viable he said the county‚Äôs tax base will be stable and diversified by then and the county won‚Äôt ‚Äúrun into the same kind of cliff‚Äù it did with the retirement of the generating station.

Malden Solar‚Äôs build out will take 12 to 18 months and create 250 construction jobs Johnson said adding that depending on the permitting process and timelines Malden Solar could begin operation at the end of 2024 but that could change.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still at 1% of the total farmland in Porter County‚Äù he said adding the project‚Äôs footprint of solar array panels and the fencing around them will be around 1200 acres.

The ground coverage ratio for the land under the panels will be at 35% to 40% he said adding the actual footprint will be about 750 acres ‚Äúless than half of a percent of the farmland in the county.‚Äù

Malden Solar does not yet have an agreement to provide its energy to NIPSCO which sends out requests for proposals for renewable energy projects said Andy Campbell NIPSCO‚Äôs director of portfolio planning and origination.

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs not valuable to us for some reason it could be valuable to someone else‚Äù he said.

The Malden Solar project Melda said is within a few months of going to the permit stage with Porter County depending on landowners and environmental surveys are already underway.

Detractors raise concerns

Not everyone sees a promise in solar energy.

Darren Grieger lives a few miles from the Malden Solar site in Morgan Township. He‚Äôs been farming corn beans and some livestock on the property for eight years. He took the farm over for his grandfather and his family has been farming on the same land for five or six generations.

He has ‚Äúso many‚Äù concerns about the project he said including the infusion of government funds into green energy projects which he called ‚Äúbad business.‚Äù

Additionally Grieger said solar farms reduce the amount of land available for farming which could lead to an increase in production costs. He also questioned how truly green the solar panels are from how they‚Äôre manufactured and shipped from China ‚Äî officials from NextEra Energy said most of their panels come from Vietnam though some are made in the United States ‚Äî and how they‚Äôre disposed of. NextEra officials said 95% of the materials in the panels can be recycled.

The panels Grieger said are behind fencing so ‚Äúit‚Äôs not like animals can graze‚Äù on that land. And while officials touted how the panels can be recycled Grieger said solar energy is still a relatively new field and it could be cheaper to toss them in a landfill than to recycle them.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to be just Malden. It‚Äôs going to spread if this passes‚Äù Grieger said adding he doesn‚Äôt see any benefit to the solar farms.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a really inefficient way (to generate electricity) but it‚Äôs being pushed so hard by these solar companies because there‚Äôs so much government money behind it‚Äù he said.

He expects a ‚Äúdomino effect‚Äù of farmers leasing their land for solar panels lured by the promise of additional income and other farmers jumping aboard.

‚ÄúNobody wants to live next to it‚Äù he said.

Officials don‚Äôt always welcome solar farms either.

NextEra had proposed a solar farm dubbed Brickyard Solar for Zionsville in Boone County north of Indianapolis according to published media reports. The proposal for a 1200-acre solar farm straddled city limits into unincorporated Boone County thereby requiring approval from both city and county boards.

The city‚Äôs board of zoning appeals denied a special exception request for the solar array. The county‚Äôs advisory planning commission also rejected the proposal stating that it deviated from the county‚Äôs comprehensive plan which said the area was supposed to stay in traditional agricultural production. NextEra subsequently withdrew its proposal about a year ago.

Robert Thompson Porter County‚Äôs director of development and stormwater management said in an email that the county‚Äôs comprehensive plan ‚Äúdoes not discuss clean or green energy solutions‚Äù and added that the plan was approved in 2002 but does not discuss that type of land use.

The county now has two small solar farms at around 10 acres each that produce about 1 megawatt each Thompson said. One of them is west of the Sedley Road bridge just south of Indiana 130 and the other is on Robbins Road adjacent to Portage city limits.

County officials expect that as is the case in Jasper County NextEra will request a financial incentive for any project here.

‚ÄúMost Indiana counties have negotiated economic development agreements with the solar farm developers‚Äù Stu Summers a consultant working with Porter County as part of the team of county staff negotiating economic development agreements for solar farms said in an email.

‚ÄúTypically the agreements require a bond to assure that at the end of the solar panels‚Äô useful life the property will be returned to its original state allowing for renewed agricultural activities. Also counties have granted limited tax abatement in return for economic development payments from the solar farm operations.‚Äù

So far they have not reached an agreement Summers said but if they do it will require the approval of the Board of Commissioners and the County Council.

Nothing has been formally presented to the council for a tax abatement hearing Thompson said in an email. ‚ÄúThere have been some very preliminary discussions on an economic package but nothing has been agreed upon as of yet or drafted up in an agreement format.‚Äù

‚ÄòA little bit of a gamble‚Äô

Sheafer the Jasper County farmer said he was approached around 2015 by Orion Renewables which came to the area to secure lease options for a solar project with the goal of putting the project together and selling it. The project was sold to NextEra Energy which is now developing it.

Sheafer who turns 60 next month has two adult children and neither is interested in farming. If they were he would have been less inclined to go into solar.

‚ÄúThe beauty of it is as we get older I don‚Äôt have to worry about weather because a percentage of our land won‚Äôt be cropped anymore‚Äù he said adding the returns on solar are roughly three times on average what he could make from farming the property.

While his property taxes will go up because of the added value of the land NextEra Energy will pay for any additional assessment beyond what Sheafer is paying now and will do so for the life of the lease agreement.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs really no additional cost for us at all and I don‚Äôt have to put the crops out which is a lot of money‚Äù he said.

He understands folks who oppose taking their land out of farm production and homeowners against solar because of how it changes the view from their property.

‚ÄúI get it. This is pretty to look at‚Äù he said sitting at his dining room table with his wife Anne and gazing out at his yard dotted with bird feeders and abutting alternating rows of corn and soybeans.

Both his traditional crops and his new one of solar panels capture the energy of the sun Sheafer said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little bit of a gamble‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI hope we look back in 30 years and say ‚ÄòYeah we‚Äôre glad we did this.'‚Äù

Ground zero in the conflict is Wyoming a stronghold for golden eagles that soar on 7-foot (2-meter) wings and a favored location for wind farms. As wind turbines proliferate scientists say deaths from collisions could drive down golden eagle numbers considered stable at best.

Yet climate change looms as a potentially greater threat: Rising temperatures are projected to reduce golden eagle breeding ranges by more than 40% later this century according to a National Audubon Society analysis.

That leaves golden eagles doubly vulnerable ‚Äî to the shifting climate and to the wind energy promoted as a solution to that warming world.

""We have some of the best golden eagle populations in Wyoming but it doesn't mean the population is not at risk"" said Bryan Bedrosian conservation director at the Teton Raptor Center in Wilson Wyoming. ""As we increase wind development across the U.S. that risk is increasing.""

Turbine blades hundreds of feet long are among myriad threats to golden eagles which are routinely shot poisoned by lead hit by vehicles and electrocuted on power lines.

The tenuous position of golden eagles contrasts with the conservation success of their avian cousins bald eagles whose numbers have quadrupled since 2009. There are an estimated 346000 bald eagles in the U.S. versus about 40000 golden eagles which need much larger areas to survive and are more inclined to have trouble with humans.

Federal officials have tried to curb turbine deaths while avoiding any slowdown in the growth of wind power as an alternative to carbon-emitting fossil fuels ‚Äî a key piece of President Joe Biden's climate agenda.

In April a Florida-based power company pleaded guilty in federal court in Wyoming to criminal violations of wildlife protection laws after its wind turbines killed more than 100 golden eagles in eight states. It was the third conviction of a major wind company for killing eagles in a decade.

Despite the deaths scientists like Bedrosian say more turbines are needed to fight climate change. He and colleague Charles Preston are finding ways wind companies can reduce or offset eagle deaths such as building in areas less frequented by the birds improving habitat elsewhere or retrofitting power poles to make them less perilous when eagles land.

""It's robbing Peter to pay Paul but it's a start and I think it's the way to go"" Preston said. ""It's a societal question: Is there room for them and us? It's not just golden eagles. They are kind of a window into the bigger picture.""

Dangling from a rope 30 feet (9 meters) above the ground with a canvas bag slung around his neck Bedrosian shouldered his way into a golden eagle nest lodged in a cliff ledge in northwestern Wyoming. As an adult eagle circled in the distance the scientist made an awkward grab for the young eagle in the nest slid a leather hood over its head then wrestled the bird into the bag.

The 6-week-old bird was lowered and carefully extracted by Preston a zip tie around its feet as a precaution against talons more than an inch long.

""The key is not to forget later to cut the zip tie"" Bedrosian said.

The eaglet went on a scale ‚Äî about 7 pounds (3.2 kilograms). Bedrosian drew some blood from a wing to test for lead exposure and Preston clamped onto each leg a metal band with numbers for identification if the eagle's recaptured or found dead.

Golden eagles don't mate until about 5 years old and produce about one chick every two years so adult eagle deaths have outsized impacts on the population Bedrosian said.

Illegal shootings are the biggest cause of death killing about 700 golden eagles annually according to federal estimates. More than 600 die annually in collisions with cars wind turbines and power lines; about 500 annually are electrocuted and more than 400 are poisoned.

""Wind mortality wasn't a thing for golden eagles 10 years ago"" Bedrosian said. ""I don't want to pick on wind as the only thing. ... But it's the additive nature of all these things and several are increasing. Vehicle strikes are increasing. Climate change is increasing. Wind is increasing.""

Federal officials won't divulge how many eagles are reported killed by wind farms saying it's sensitive law enforcement information. The recent criminal prosecution of a subsidiary of NextEra Energy one of the largest U.S. renewable energy providers offered a glimpse into the problem's scope.

The company pleaded guilty to three counts of violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and was ordered to pay more than $8 million in fines and restitution after killing at least 150 eagles ‚Äî including more than 100 goldens at wind farms in Wyoming California New Mexico North Dakota Colorado Michigan Arizona and Illinois.

Government officials said the mortality was likely higher because some turbines killed multiple eagles and carcasses are not always found.

Prosecutors said the company's failure to take steps to protect eagles or to obtain permits to kill the birds gave it an advantage over competitors that did take such steps ‚Äî even as NextEra and affiliates received hundreds of millions of dollars in federal tax credits for wind power.

The company remained defiant after the plea deal: NextEra President Rebecca Kujawa said bird collisions with turbines were unavoidable accidents that should not be criminalized.

Utilities Duke Energy and PacifiCorp previously pleaded guilty to similar charges in Wyoming. North Carolina-based Duke Energy was sentenced in 2013 to $1 million in fines and restitution and five years probation following deaths of 14 golden eagles and 149 other birds at two of the company's wind projects.

A year later Oregon-based PacifiCorp received $2.5 million in fines and five years probation after 38 golden eagle carcasses and 336 other protected birds were discovered at two of its sites.

The number of wind turbines nationwide more than doubled over the past decade to almost 72000 according to U.S. Geological Survey data with development overlapping prime golden eagle territory in states including Wyoming Montana California Washington and Oregon.

USGS scientists concluded in a recent study that if anticipated growth in wind energy by 2040 occurs increased turbine-caused deaths could cut golden eagle populations by almost half over 10 years.

However the fact that no population-wide declines have been seen in recent years suggests some uncertainty in the projections. said lead author Jay Diffendorfer.

Federal wildlife officials are pushing wind companies to enroll in a permitting program that allows them to kill eagles if the deaths are offset.

Companies with permits can pay utilities to retrofit power poles so lines are spaced far enough that eagles can't be easily electrocuted. Every 11 poles retrofitted typically means one eagle death avoided annually.

Nationwide 34 permits in place last year authorized companies to ""take"" 170 golden eagles ‚Äî meaning that many birds could be killed by turbines or lost through impacts on nests or habitat.

For each loss companies are responsible for ensuring at least one eagle death is avoided somewhere else. Using conservative estimates that overcount potential deaths could even mean a gain of eagles in the long run said Brian Millsap who heads the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's eagle program.

""This sounds crass but it's realistic. Eagles are going to be incidentally killed at wind farms"" he said. ""We've got to reduce other things that will allow wind energy development.""

Agency officials would not disclose which companies hold permits. An Associated Press public records review shows most are wind farms.

Federal officials collect golden eagle death data through an online reporting system used by government agencies companies scientists tribes and private groups.

Fish and Wildlife Service officials declined to release the data because they said it could be used in future law enforcement cases.

The nests where Bedrosian and Preston are doing population studies are about 60 miles (96 kilometers) from the nearest wind farm ‚Äî 114 turbines that PacifiCorp began operating about two years ago near the Wyoming-Montana border.

Personnel on site scan the skies with binoculars for eagles and can shut down turbines when the birds approach.

""We tend to see more golden eagles in prairie areas where you're going to have the best wind regimes"" said Travis Brown a biologist with PacifiCorp. ""It's almost like competition for the wind resource because the birds are using it for movement.""

Ten PacifiCorp wind farms have permits authorizing the incidental killing of eagles and an application is pending for two more the company said.

Company representatives declined to say how many eagles have died under its federal permits. They said PacifiCorp's been building a ""bank"" of retrofitted power poles to offset eagle deaths and also wants to try new approaches such as painting turbine blades to be more visible and easier to avoid.

""We're working as hard as we can to avoid and minimize (deaths) up front and then anything we can't we're mitigating on the back end"" Brown said.",,,,,,

The pilot will enable them to expand their capacity giving them more time for clinical tasks such as checking blood pressure dressing wounds and assessing patient‚Äôs relevant health needs.

The glasses also help nurses look up their next appointment that day and check how long it will take to get there based on live travel updates. The software used in the smart glasses dubbed A.Consult was developed by Concept Health.

Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust will be trialling the techonology in August 2022.

Dr Tim Ferris NHS director for transformation said: ‚ÄúSome of the best innovations come from local solutions and so through this project NHS staff can test what works for them and what provides the best possible care for patients.

‚ÄúThese new smart glasses are the latest pioneering tech and really show us what the future of the NHS could look like ‚Äì they are a win-win for staff and patients alike freeing up time consuming admin for nurses meaning more time for patient care.‚Äù

NHS England awarded the trust ¬£400000 to test the technology as part of a wider innovation project which is set to fund a further 16 pilot projects over the coming months.

Local patients in Northern Lincolnshire and Goole will be informed about the project and asked if they consent for the technology to be used and their data to be recorded. If they agree patient data will be transferred securely to the electronic patient record (EPR) system.

Becky Birchall community tissue viability clinical nurse specialist at the trust said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to be the first team to try the smart glasses out and can‚Äôt wait to take them out on our community visits.

‚ÄúWe currently spend a considerable amount of time writing up our visits to patients and these cutting-edge glasses will really help to cut down the time we need to keep for admin supporting us to provide focussed patient care.

‚ÄúThe glasses have a thermal imaging feature which I think will be particularly useful for us when we are examining wounds and these features are going to really help us provide the best possible care for our patients.‚Äù

The pilot is one of 17 projects across 16 healthcare organisations to receive a share of ¬£6million of the Digital PODAC Unified Tech Fund set by NHS England.

NASA issued the request for information (RFI) late Aug. 19 asking companies to supply information about how they could develop a spacecraft that would be used to perform the final reentry maneuvers at the end of the station‚Äôs life pushing it into the atmosphere to break up over the South Pacific Ocean.

Under a nominal deorbiting scenario provided by NASA in the RFI the spacecraft would attach to the forward port on the Node 2 module a year before reentry. During this time the station‚Äôs altitude would gradually decay from atmospheric drag and maneuvers from thrusters on the station‚Äôs Russian segment descending below 220 kilometers the altitude below which only thrusters can provide attitude control for the station.

The deorbit vehicle would first place the ISS into an elliptical orbit of 145 by 200 kilometers to minimize the period in which the station has to rely on thrusters for attitude control. It would then make a final burn to lower the perigee to 50 kilometers ensuring ‚Äúatmospheric capture‚Äù or breakup of the station upon reentry.

NASA in an ISS transition plan published in January projected using Russian Progress cargo spacecraft for reentry. ‚ÄúNASA and its partners have evaluated varying quantities of Russian Progress spacecraft and determined that three can accomplish the de-orbit‚Äù the report stated. It added that Northrop Grumman‚Äôs Cygnus spacecraft which is capable of reboosting the station‚Äôs orbit has also been considered for deorbiting the station.

‚ÄúIn a years-long effort NASA and its partners have studied deorbit requirements and developed a strategy and action plan that evaluated the use of multiple Roscosmos Progress spacecraft to support deorbit operations‚Äù NASA said in a statement announcing the RFI. ‚ÄúThese studies indicated additional spacecraft may provide more robust capabilities for deorbit and NASA has decided to assess U.S. industry‚Äôs ability to aid with safe deorbit of the complex.‚Äù

‚ÄúNASA and our international partners are taking the prudent approach to the space station‚Äôs end of life planning to safely execute deorbit‚Äù Kathy Lueders NASA associate administrator for space operations said in the statement. ‚ÄúAs part of our 2030 transition planning we are pursuing sufficient redundancy for the safety of the crew and people and structures on Earth. This also could be an important U.S. capability for future commercial destinations.‚Äù

NASA and the other ISS partners except for Russia have endorsed an extension of ISS operations from 2024 to 2030. Russian officials have said they plan to exit the ISS some time after 2024 but have not set a firm date. In the RFI NASA said the nominal scenario calls for deorbiting the ISS in early 2031 but that it could be delayed or moved up depending on the status of ISS operations.

‚ÄúAlthough nominal ISS [end of life] is late 2030 the Government requires that this deorbit capability be available as soon as possible to protect for contingencies that could drive early re-entry and beyond 2030 in the event of further ISS mission extensions‚Äù the RFI stated. That includes the ability of launching the deorbit spacecraft as soon as six months before the final deorbit maneuvers.

In the RFI NASA asks industry for their technical capabilities to develop a deorbit module that meets its requirements as well as preferred contracting arrangements operational issues and extensibility of such a module to serve commercial space stations. Responses are due to NASA Sept. 9.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNzdWxiLmVkdS9jb2xsZWdlLW9mLWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nL2FydGljbGUvYmVzc3QtcHJvZ3JhbS1raWNrcy1uaW50aC15ZWFy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BESST Program Kicks Off Ninth Year | California State University Long Beach,"Northrop Grumman Vice President Candace Givens‚Äô career has taken many twists and turns. The Carson native headed to Hampton University at age 16 to study electrical engineering. She applied for a job as an administrative assistant and got hired as a design engineer with the rest of her tuition paid.

Her undergraduate degree turned out to be a B.A. in economics from CSULB but she later earned a master‚Äôs degree in systems engineering and a doctorate in organizational change and management. Givens rose to her position as vice president after two decades spent working in design and program management.

The CSULB alumni was among a number of industry professionals who helped introduce the 53 new members of the CSULB Beach Engineering Student Success Team (BESST) to the field of engineering during the Summer Academy this August. ‚ÄúBeing an engineer you will never have to worry about work‚Äù she told them. ‚ÄúNever ever.‚Äù

Givens who is vice president of the OGS Business Unit overseeing payload and ground systems advised the students to follow their interests. ‚ÄúYou should do what you really like‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNo matter where you start if you have a vision for what you want to do you can do it.‚Äù

After breezing through high school Givens was shocked when she failed Calculus on her first try. The experience was eye-opening. After that she enlisted tutors and learned how to study and ask for help. She advised the BESST students to take advantage of all the resources the program offers.

Other speakers included Dorothy Benveniste chair of COE‚Äôs 100+ Women Strong; Jason Deutschman associate director of the COE Engineering Student Success Center; Jasmine Garcia an industrial engineer with Abbott Labs; Kayla Rosario a project technical lead with Boeing; and Willy Rosner principal with Fulcrum Construction.

COE Dean Jinny Rhee Associate Dean of Academic Programs Antonella Sciortino and Director of Development Cheryl Ward also spoke to the incoming BESST tracks.

During the weeklong Summer Academy teams completed ice-breaker exercises heard about various engineering professions received math tutoring and toured the campus and library. A highlight of the week was off-campus tours to Romeo Power and the Port of Los Angeles.

At the closing ceremony COE Director of K-12 Outreach and Recruitment Saba Yohannes-Reda congratulated the students on completing their first week of the program despite some having plans for work or vacation. ‚ÄúI really admire your commitment‚Äù she said.

The Summer Academy kicked off the ninth year of the innovative year-long program which provides cohort-based classes a buddy system of past program graduates as peer mentors career-readiness support and guidance and intensive supplemental tutoring to help students pass crucial classes like Calculus.

Now imagine that scene taking place on a sandy beach near the ocean with a bunch of engineer space nerds.

Watermelon eating tug-of-war human pyramid and dodgeball. These are just a few competitions that are part of the annual Aerospace Games in Los Angeles where employees and interns from SpaceX Virgin Orbit Blue Origin Boeing and NASA‚Äîamong many others‚Äîcompete for trophies and glory.

In late July for the first time since before the Covid-19 pandemic the ""fun and family-friendly‚Äù games returned to Dockweiler Beach hosted by 2019 winner Northrop Grumman with ""30+ companies 6000+ attendees and ONE overall champion.‚Äù Hundreds of aerospace and Department of Defense workers are bused in donning colorful T-shirts with their respective employers' names plastered on the front.

Home bases were set up bright and early. Companies budgeted for boxed lunches and tables displayed satellite models and informational flyers. Walking alongside the tents Ernest Yeung a 42-year-old flight software engineer at Terran Orbital and a balloon toss competitor reminisces: ‚ÄúLook at all of these companies that I applied to that rejected me!‚Äù Obtaining his master's in theoretical physics in 2014 Yeung had pivoted his career from academia after being inspired by Richard Branson and Elon Musk. He taught himself programming while driving an Uber for a year handing out r√©sum√©s at the SpaceX campus. Two years of applications later he received his first yes from Virgin Orbit. Pride still remains for his previous employer though he‚Äôs switched jobs and no longer competes in the relay races: ‚ÄúWe were the third commercial space company to get to orbit after SpaceX and Rocket Lab.‚Äù The annual gathering at Dockweiler reminded him of his own journey.

‚ÄúIn a deep personal emotional way I knew what it was like being on the outside‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúFor me I just feel like I made it. I‚Äôm part of this community.‚Äù

Winning involves strategy as one Reddit user posted in a 2016 thread: ""SpaceX came in first place overall after stacking their tug-of-war team with factory floor workers!"" The entire competition is based on a points allotment system where winners receive 40 total points with each team at second place and below earning fewer points in each game. Relay races have batting orders of sorts designed to ensure that no one would get tired and that time isn‚Äôt wasted on player transitions. Even with all of this strategy however the goal for many participants is not first place.

‚ÄúPeople don't want to win first place because the first-place team has to plan next year‚Äôs Aerospace Games. So realistically you aim for second‚Äù says engineer Joan Marie Tubungbanua as she paints a red ‚ÄúJPL‚Äù stencil across a teammate‚Äôs face. For the past few years SpaceX and Northrop Grumman have alternated hosting duties. The 22-year-old NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) system engineer and University of Southern California masters student works on the Psyche mission to explore a metal-rich asteroid in orbit between Mars and Jupiter but today she was the wheel to the wheelbarrow duo in JPL‚Äôs lineup. Unfortunately this meant that she inhaled quite a bit of sand.

‚ÄúWe didn't expect the sand to be as deep as it is on the actual beach. And so we definitely had to adjust our strategy a little bit‚Äù chuckles Tubungbanua. Her teammate 19-year-old Kruti Bhingradiya a robotics intern at JPL and student from Gujarat points out that while corporate bonding games like cricket are prevalent in India the relay race in the United States was unique. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôve never seen baseball bats before.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvcHJvcHVsc2lvbi1kZWFsLW9mZmVycy1ib29zdC1mb3Itc2NvdHRpc2gtaG9yaXpvbnRhbC1zcGFjZS1sYXVuY2hlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Propulsion deal offers boost for Scottish horizontal space launches ‚Äì Spaceflight Now,"UK-based horizontal launch company Astraius says it‚Äôs on track for a first launch in spring 2024 from Prestwick Spaceport in Scotland after signing deals with two key suppliers for its innovative rocket.

Northrop Grumman is to supply first and second motors and Exquadrum will provide the upper-stage motor. Northrop Grumman‚Äôs Orion solid rocket motors will boost the Astraius launch vehicle after its extraction from an unmodified C-17 carrier aircraft while Exquadrum‚Äôs bespoke upper stage will place satellites in precise orbits.

The Astraius rocket with a payload capability of 800 kg to low Earth orbit (LEO) will ignite within seconds of being released via a parachute system on a cargo pallet from the back of the aircraft.

‚ÄúIt will be a bespoke Astraius launch vehicle‚Äù said Shane Clark vice president of the firm‚Äôs engineering and program division. ‚ÄúOur strategy is to minimise new development so essentially we have stitched together flight-proven components.

‚ÄúThis is a new launch vehicle but it‚Äôs not a brand new first stage it‚Äôs not a brand new second stage and it probably not a brand new faring or avionics system‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúMost of the rocket‚Äôs components will already have flight pedigree which gives assurance to both customers and the insurance market.‚Äù

Huntsville Alabama-based Clark told Spaceflight Now that the global reach and flexibility of the C-17 military transporter aircraft would allow Astraius to offer an industry-leading capability for small satellite launches to LEO.

‚ÄúWe will not be confined to a spaceport or by the weather in the same way that vertical launchers are‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWith horizontal launch wherever that customer wants to go we will fly to that optimum launch point over water and put them into exactly the right inclination.

‚ÄúIf for example if you‚Äôre on the West Coast of California you cannot launch into an elliptical orbit because you can‚Äôt launch east. Conversely if you‚Äôre in Florida typically you‚Äôre not going to be able to get to a polar orbit.‚Äù

While launching a dozen rockets per year each carrying a 800 kg satellite would be an ideal scenario Clark said the prime market would most likley be for the launch of cubesats in a wide variety of different configurations either for single or multiple customers.

Announcing the tie up with Northrop Grumman and Exquadrum at last month‚Äôs Farnborough International Airshow Astraius chairman Sir George Zambellas said: ‚ÄúThis is a hugely exciting moment for Astraius. We have a winning combination of proven launch and propulsion systems paired with exquisite rocket motor technology to produce a world-class capability.‚Äù

Kevin Mahaffy CEO of Exquadrum said: ‚ÄúWe are excited to be part of the outstanding team that Astraius has put together to bring their unique horizontal launch vehicle to market. Exquadrum‚Äôs controllable solid rocket motor technology with its throttlability and precise termination ability is an excellent fit for Astraius‚Äô upper stage application.‚Äù

Astraius is building two cleanrooms at Prestwick Spaceport‚Äôs new ¬£23 million facility meaning two rockets and their payloads can be processed simultaneously giving the option of flying a second mission within hours of the first.

Astraius will base its launch and range operations in the UK at Scotland‚Äôs Prestwick Spaceport which will provide all necessary ground-based requirements in bespoke state-of-the-art facilities under an agreement signed in September 2021.

The Boeing C-17 Globemaster aircraft was developed for the United States Air Force (USAF) from the 1980s to the early 1990s by McDonnell Douglas.

Wrestling -- and a lot of it -- is the obvious appeal. AEW (All Elite Wrestling) is the onboard promoter and competitions will take place every day. Imagine a huge wrestling ring with awesome sight lines in the middle of a pool deck; reviews of the first cruise praised the intimacy of it all. Beyond wrestling the Ship of Jericho boasts a lineup of hard rock blues and metal bands starting with Jericho's own group Fozzy. (Fun fact: Jericho was inspired to do the first Rager at Sea after he played with his band on the KISS Kruise). Other bands include 80s favorite Quiet Riot Royal Bliss and Raven as well as others. Comedian Brad Williams will be the ""master of laughs.""

Several podcasts will be taped onboard including Jericho's own ""Talk is Jericho.""

Cayamo draws many repeat cruisers so if you're interested it's best to sign up for the pre-sale as cabins begin booking long before the lineup is announced.

General Info for Cayamo 2023

The weeklong full-charter cruise sails roundtrip from Miami February 10 to 17 2023. As part of the voyage 2394-passenger Norwegian Pearl will visit St. Maarten and Tortola.

Scoring a cabin on Cayamo is tough especially if you're a newbie. Guests from Cayamo 2022 are automatically included in the pre-sale and get first priority to book. Then bookings open for Cayamo alumni people who were placed on the most recent cruise waiting list and those who had to cancel. The last group to get pre-sale preference is new Cayamo guests. The cruise then opens to the general public for booking.

Lineup and Highlights for Cayamo 2023

The Cayamo lineup for 2023 includes a mix of folk rock alternative country bluegrass and blues artists that have made the at-sea festival a draw for more than a decade.

Listed artists include Jeff Tweedy Andrew Bird Trampled by Turtles the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band Neko Case Shovels & Rope and much more.

Cayamo is strong because of the sheer volume of performers -- many of which have small but dedicated followings -- as opposed to one star band. It's fairly common for musicians to drop in on each other's sets. Sixthman has also partnered with Black Opry to bring more diversity to the offerings.

Concerts are the main entertainment onboard but the Cayamo cruise also has special experiences for passengers such as beer tastings songwriting sessions open jams live interviews autograph signings and more.

Onboard Vibe of Cayamo 2023

The onboard vibe is mellow and fun. Cayamo draws mostly cruisers in the Baby Boomer age range who are past the hard-rocking stage of life. Expect to see people listening to music while lying down in their pool chairs as opposed to crowding the stage. Midnight jam sessions are common and they can go late but after-parties aren't necessarily packed. You're almost sure to hear some Grateful Dead covers.

Who Would Like Cayamo 2023

This sailing is ideal for American music lovers and acoustic guitar fans who like a variety of genres and are also drawn to the idea of joining a ""music family."" Many cruisers cite the friends they've made over repeated Cayamo voyages as part of the draw.

How to Book Cayamo 2023

This cruise is run by Sixthman a theme cruise operator owned by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. Bookings are done via the Cayamo website. The 2023 cruise still seems to have space as of August 2022 but act fast -- they won't last long.

Nvidia has long been the dominant player in the graphics card market but the company has from time to time been put under serious pressure by its main rival AMD which has launched several of its own iconic GPUs. Those only set Nvidia up for a major comeback however and sometimes that led to a real game-changing card.

Recommended Videos

It was hard to choose which Nvidia GPUs were truly worthy of being called the best of all time but I‚Äôve narrowed down the list to six cards that were truly important and made history.

Get your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!

GeForce 256

The very first

Although Nvidia often claims the GeForce 256 was the world‚Äôs first GPU that‚Äôs only true if Nvidia is the only company that gets to define what a GPU is. Before GeForce there were the RIVA series of graphics cards and there were other companies making their own competing graphics cards then too. What Nvidia really invented was the marketing of graphics cards as GPUs because in 1999 when the 256 came out terms like graphics card and graphics chipset were more common.

Nvidia is right that the 256 was important however. Before the 256 the CPU played a very important role in rendering graphics to the point where the CPU was directly completing steps in rendering a 3D environment. However CPUs were not very efficient at doing this which is where the 256 came in with hardware transforming and lighting offloading the two most CPU intensive parts of rendering onto the GPU. This is one of the primary reasons why Nvidia claims this is the first GPU.

As a product the GeForce 256 wasn‚Äôt exactly legendary: Anandtech wasn‚Äôt super impressed by its price for the performance at the time of its release. Part of the problem was the 256‚Äôs memory which was single data rate or SDR. Due to other advances SDR was becoming insufficient for GPUs of this performance level. A faster dual data rate or DDR (the same DDR as in DDR5) launched just before the end of 1999 which finally met Anandtech‚Äôs expectations for performance but the increased price tag of the DDR version was hard to swallow.

The GeForce 256 first of its name is certainly historical but not because it was an amazing product. The 256 is important because it inaugurated the modern era of GPUs. The graphics card market wasn‚Äôt always a duopoly; back in the 90s there were multiple companies competing against each other with Nvidia being just one of them. Soon after the GeForce 256 launched most of Nvidia‚Äôs rivals exited the market. 3dfx‚Äôs Voodoo 5 GPUs were uncompetitive and before it went bankrupt many of its technologies were bought by Nvidia; Matrox simply quit gaming GPUs altogether to focus on professional graphics.

By the end of 2000 the only other graphics company in town was ATI. When AMD acquired ATI in 2006 it brought about the modern Nvidia and AMD rivalry we all know today.

GeForce 8800 GTX

A monumental leap forward

After the GeForce 256 Nvidia and ATI attempted to best the other with newer GPUs with higher performance. In 2002 however ATI threw down the gauntlet by launching its Radeon 9000 series and at a die size of 200mm squared the flagship Radeon 9800 XT was easily the largest GPU ever. Nvidia‚Äôs flagship GeForce4 Ti 4600 at 100mm had no hope of beating even the midrange 9700 Pro which inflicted a crushing defeat on Nvidia. Making a GPU was no longer just about the architecture the memory or the drivers; in order to win Nvidia would need to make big GPUs like ATI.

For the next four years the size of flagship GPUs continued to increase and by 2005 both companies had launched a GPU that was around 300mm. Although Nvidia had regained the upper hand during this time ATI was never far behind and its Radeon X1000 series was fairly competitive. A GPU sized at 300mm was far from the limit of what Nvidia could do however. In 2006 Nvidia released its GeForce 8 series led by the flagship 8800 GTX. Its GPU codenamed G80 was nearly 500mm and its transistor count was almost three times higher than the last GeForce flagship.

The 8800 GTX did to ATI what the Radeon 9700 Pro and the rest of the 9000 series did to Nvidia with Anandtech describing the moment as ‚Äú9700 Pro-like.‚Äù A single 8800 GTX was almost twice as fast as ATI‚Äôs top-end X1950 XTX not to mention much more efficient. At $599 the 8800 GTX was more expensive than its predecessors but its high level of performance and DirectX 10 support made up for it.

But this was mostly the end of the big GPU arms race that had characterized the early 2000s for two main reasons. Firstly 500mm was getting pretty close to the limit of how large a GPU could be and even today 500mm is relatively big for a processor. Even if Nvidia wanted to making a bigger GPU just wasn‚Äôt feasible. Secondly ATI wasn‚Äôt working on its own 500mm GPU anyway so Nvidia wasn‚Äôt in a rush to get an even bigger GPU to market. Nvidia had basically won the arms race by outspending ATI.

That year also saw the acquisition of ATI by AMD which was finalized just before the 8800 GTX launched. Although ATI now had the backing of AMD it really seemed like Nvidia had such a massive lead that Radeon wouldn‚Äôt challenge GeForce for a long time perhaps never again.

GeForce GTX 680

Beating AMD at its own game

Nvidia‚Äôs next landmark release came in 2008 when it launched the GTX 200 series starting with the GTX 280 and GTX 260. At nearly 600mm squared the 280 was a worthy monstrous successor to the 8800 GTX. Meanwhile AMD and ATI signaled that they would no longer be launching high-end GPUs with big dies in order to compete rather focusing on making smaller GPUs in a gambit known as the small die strategy. In its review Anandtech said ‚ÄúNvidia will be left all alone with top performance for the foreseeable future.‚Äù As it turned out the next four years were pretty rough for Nvidia.

Starting with the HD 4000 series in 2008 AMD assaulted Nvidia with small GPUs that had high value and almost flagship levels of performance and that dynamic was maintained throughout the next few generations. Nvidia‚Äôs GTX 280 wasn‚Äôt cost effective enough then the GTX 400 series was delayed and the 500 series was too hot and power hungry.

One of Nvidia‚Äôs traditional weaknesses was its disadvantage when it came to process the way processors are manufactured. Nvidia was usually behind AMD but it had finally caught up by using the 40nm node for the 400 series. AMD however wanted to regain the process lead quickly and decided its next generation would be on the new 28nm node and Nvidia decided to follow suit.

AMD won the race to 28nm with its HD 7000 series with its flagship HD 7970 putting AMD back in first place for performance. However the GTX 680 launched just two months later and not only did it beat the 7970 in performance but also power efficiency and even die size. As Anandtech put it Nvidia had ‚Äúlanded the technical trifecta‚Äù and that completely flipped the tables on AMD. AMD did reclaim the performance crown yet again by launching the HD 7970 GHz Edition later in 2012 (notable for being the first 1GHz GPU) but having the lead in efficiency and performance per millimeter was a good sign for Nvidia.

The back and forth battle between Nvidia and AMD was pretty exciting after how disappointing the GTX 400 and 500 series had been and while the 680 wasn‚Äôt an 8800 GTX it signaled Nvidia‚Äôs return to being truly competitive against AMD. Perhaps most importantly Nvidia was no longer weighed down by its traditional process disadvantage and that would eventually pay off in a big way.

GeForce GTX 980

Nvidia‚Äôs dominance begins

Nvidia found itself in a very good spot with the GTX 600 series and it was because of TSMC‚Äôs 28nm process. Under normal circumstances AMD would have simply gone to TSMC‚Äôs next process in order to regain its traditional advantage but this was no longer an option. TSMC and all other foundries in the world (except for Intel) had an extraordinary amount of difficulty progressing beyond the 28nm node. New technologies were needed in order to progress further which meant Nvidia didn‚Äôt have to worry about AMD regaining the process lead any time soon.

Following a few years of back and forth and AMD floundering with limited funds Nvidia launched the GTX 900 series in 2014 inaugurated by the GTX 980. Based on the new Maxwell architecture it was an incredible improvement over the GTX 600 and 700 series despite being on the same node. The 980 was between 30% and 40% faster than the 780 while consuming less power and it was even a smidge faster than the top-end 780 Ti. Of course the 980 also beat the R9 290X once again landing the trifecta of performance power efficiency and die size. In its review Anandtech said the 980 came ‚Äúvery very close to doing to the Radeon 290X what the GTX 680 did to Radeon HD 7970.‚Äù

AMD was incapable of responding. It didn‚Äôt have a next-generation GPU ready to launch in 2014. In fact AMD wasn‚Äôt even working on a complete lineup of brand-new GPUs to even the score with Nvidia. AMD instead was planning on rebranding the Radeon 200 series as the Radeon 300 series and would develop one new GPU to serve as the flagship. All of these GPUs were to launch in mid 2015 giving the entire GPU market to Nvidia for nearly a full year. Of course Nvidia wanted to pull the rug right from under AMD and prepared a brand-new flagship.

Launching in mid 2015 the GTX 980 Ti was about 30% faster than the GTX 980 thanks to its significantly higher power consumption and larger die size at just over 600mm squared. It beat AMD‚Äôs brand-new R9 Fury X a month before it even launched. Although the Fury X wasn‚Äôt bad it had lower performance than the 980 Ti higher power consumption and much less VRAM. It was a demonstration of how far ahead Nvidia was with the 900 series; while AMD was hastily trying to get the Fury X out the door Nvidia could have launched the 980 Ti any time it wanted.

Anandtech put it pretty well: ‚ÄúThe fact that they get so close only to be outmaneuvered by Nvidia once again makes the current situation all the more painful; it‚Äôs one thing to lose to Nvidia by feet but to lose by inches only reminds you of just how close they got how they almost upset Nvidia.‚Äù

Nvidia was basically a year ahead of AMD technologically and while what they had done with the GTX 900 series was impressive it was also a bit depressing. People wanted to see Nvidia and AMD duke it out like they had done in 2012 and 2013 but it started to look like that was all in the past. Nvidia‚Äôs next GPU would certainly reaffirm that feeling.

GeForce GTX 1080

The GPU with no competition but itself

In 2015 TSMC had finally completed the 16nm process which could achieve 40% higher clock speeds than 28nm at the same power or half the power of 28nm at similar clock speeds. However Nvidia planned to move to 16nm in 2016 when the node was more mature. Meanwhile AMD had absolutely no plans to utilize TSMC‚Äôs 16nm but instead moved to launch new GPUs and CPUs on GlobalFoundries‚Äôs 14nm process. But don‚Äôt be fooled by the names: TSMC‚Äôs 16nm was and is better than GlobalFoundries‚Äôs 14nm. After 28nm nomenclature for processes became based in marketing rather than scientific measurements. This meant that for the first time in modern GPU history Nvidia had the process advantage against AMD.

The GTX 10-series launched in mid-2016 based on the new Pascal architecture and TSMC‚Äôs 16nm node. Pascal wasn‚Äôt actually very different from Maxwell but the jump from 28nm to 16nm was massive like Intel going from 14nm on Skylake to 10nm on Alder Lake. The GTX 1080 was the new flagship and it‚Äôs hard to overstate how fast it was. The GTX 980 was a little faster than the GTX 780 Ti when it came out. By contrast the GTX 1080 was over 30% faster than the GTX 980 Ti and for $50 less too. The die size of the 1080 was also extremely impressive at just over 300mm squared nearly half the size of the 980 Ti.

With the 1080 and the rest of the 10-series lineup Nvidia effectively took the entire desktop GPU market for itself. AMD‚Äôs 300 series and the Fury X were simply no match. At the midrange AMD launched the RX 400 series but these were just three low to mid-range GPUs that were a throwback to the small die strategy minus the part where Nvidia‚Äôs flagship was in striking distance like with the GTX 280 and the HD 4870. In fact the 1080 was nearly twice as fast as the RX 480. The only GPU AMD could really beat was the mid-range GTX 1060 as the slightly cut down GTX 1070 was just a little too fast to lose to the Fury X.

AMD did eventually launch new high-end GPUs in the form of RX Vega a full year after the 1080 came out. With much higher power consumption and the same selling price the flagship RX Vega 64 beat the GTX 1080 by a hair but wasn‚Äôt very competitive. However the GTX 1080 was no longer Nvidia‚Äôs flagship; with relatively small die size and a full year to prepare Nvidia launched a brand-new flagship a whole three months before RX Vega even launched; it was a repeat of the 980 Ti. The new GTX 1080 Ti was even faster than the GTX 1080 delivering yet another 30% improvement to performance. As Anandtech put it the 1080 Ti ‚Äúfurther solidifie[d] Nvidia‚Äôs dominance of the high-end video card market.‚Äù

AMD‚Äôs failure to deliver a truly competitive high-end GPU meant that the 1080‚Äôs only real competition was Nvidia‚Äôs own GTX 1080 Ti. With the 1080 and the 1080 Ti Nvidia achieved what is perhaps the most complete victory we‚Äôve seen so far in modern GPU history. Over the past 4 years Nvidia kept increasing its technological advantage over AMD and it was hard to see how Nvidia could ever lose.

GeForce RTX 3080

Correcting course

After such a long and incredible streak of wins perhaps it was inevitable that Nvidia would succumb to hubris and lose sight of what made Nvidia‚Äôs great GPUs so great. Nvidia did not follow up the GTX 10 series with yet another GPU with a stunning increase in performance but with the infamous RTX 20 series. Perhaps in a move to cut AMD out of the GPU market Nvidia focused on introducing hardware accelerated ray tracing and A.I. upscaling instead of delivering better performance in general. If successful Nvidia could make AMD GPUs irrelevant until the company finally made Radeon GPUs with built-in ray tracing.

RTX 20-series was a bit of a flop. When the RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti launched in late 2018 there weren‚Äôt even any games that supported ray tracing or deep learning super sampling (DLSS). But Nvidia priced RTX 20-series cards as if those features made all the difference. At $699 the 2080 had a nonsensical price and the 2080 Ti‚Äôs $1199 price tag was even more insane. Nvidia wasn‚Äôt even competing with itself anymore.

The performance improvement in existing titles was extremely disappointing too; the RTX 2080 was only 11% faster than the GTX 1080 though at least the RTX 2080 Ti was around 30% faster than the GTX 1080 Ti.

The next two years were a course correction for Nvidia. The threat from AMD was starting to become pretty serious; the company had finally regained the process advantage by moving to TSMC‚Äôs 7nm and the company launched the RX 5700 XT in mid-2019. Nvidia was able to head it off once again by launching new GPUs this time the RTX 20 Super series with a focus on value but the 5700 XT must have worried Nvidia. The RTX 2080 Ti was three times as large yet was only 50% faster meaning AMD was achieving much higher performance per millimeter. If AMD made a larger GPU it could be difficult to beat.

Both Nvidia and AMD planned for a big showdown in 2020. Nvidia recognized AMD‚Äôs potential and pulled out all the stops: the new 8nm process from Samsung the new Ampere architecture and an emphasis on big GPUs. AMD meanwhile stayed on TSMC‚Äôs 7nm process but introduced the new RDNA 2 architecture and would also be launching a big GPU its first since RX Vega in 2017. The last time both companies launched brand-new flagships within the same year was 2013 nearly a decade ago. Though the pandemic threatened to ruin the plans of both companies neither company was willing to delay the next generation and launched as planned.

Nvidia fired first with the RTX 30-series led by the flagship RTX 3090 but most of the focus was on the RTX 3080 since at $699 it was far more affordable than the $1499 3090. Instead of being a repeat of the RTX 20-series the 3080 delivered a sizeable 30% bump in performance at 4K over the RTX 2080 Ti though the power consumption was a little high. At lower resolutions the performance gain of the 3080 was somewhat less but since the 3080 was very capable at 4K it was easy to overlook this. The 3080 also benefitted from a wider variety of games supporting ray tracing and DLSS giving value to having an Nvidia GPU with those features.

Of course this wouldn‚Äôt matter if the 3080 and the rest of the RTX 30-series couldn‚Äôt stand up to AMD‚Äôs new RX 6000 series which launched two months later. At $649 the RX 6800 XT was AMD‚Äôs answer to the RTX 3080. With nearly identical performance in most games and at most resolutions the battle between the 3080 and the 6800 XT was reminiscent of the GTX 680 and the HD 7970. Each company had its advantages and disadvantages with AMD leading in power efficiency and performance while Nvidia had better performance in ray tracing and support for other features like A.I. upscaling.

The excitement over a new episode in the GPU war quickly died out though because it quickly came apparent that nobody could buy RTX 30 or RX 6000 or even any GPUs at all. The pandemic had seriously reduced supply while crypto increased demand and scalpers snatched up as many GPUs as they could. At the time of writing the shortage has mostly ended but most Nvidia GPUs are still selling for usually $100 or more over MSRP. Thankfully higher-end GPUs like the RTX 3080 can be found closer to MSRP than lower-end 30 series cards which keeps the 3080 a viable option.

On the whole the RTX 3080 was a much-needed correction from Nvidia. Although the 3080 has marked the end of Nvidia‚Äôs near total domination of the desktop GPU market it‚Äôs hard not to give the company credit for not losing to AMD. After all the RX 6000 series is on a much better process and AMD has been extremely aggressive these past few years. And besides it‚Äôs good to finally see a close race between Nvidia and AMD where both sides are trying really hard to win.

So what‚Äôs next?

Unlike AMD Nvidia always keeps its cards close to its chest and rarely ever reveals information on upcoming products. We can be pretty confident the upcoming RTX 40 series will launch sometime this year but everything else is uncertain. One of the more interesting rumors is that Nvidia will utilize TSMC‚Äôs 5nm for RTX 40 GPUs and if this is true then that means Nvidia will have parity with AMD once again.

But I think that as long as RTX 40 isn‚Äôt another RTX 20 and provides more low-end and mid-range options than RTX 30 Nvidia should have a good enough product next generation. I would really like for it to be so good that it makes the list of best Nvidia GPUs of all time but we‚Äôll have to wait and see.

Occidental‚Äôs share price soared 9.9% closing up $6.41 at $71.29 after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said letting Berkshire add to its 20.2% stake was ‚Äúconsistent with the public interest.‚Äù

Berkshire had applied to increase its stake on July 11 saying it would not hurt competition undermine regulatory authority or boost costs for consumers. FERC regulates the interstate transmission of electricity natural gas and oil.

The share price of Houston-based Occidental has more than doubled this year benefiting from rising oil prices following Russia‚Äôs Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Berkshire began buying Occidental shares four days later.

Buffett‚Äôs Omaha Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock which helped finance the 2019 purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion.

Berkshire also ended June with a $23.7 billion stake in a larger oil company Chevron (CVX).

‚ÄúBuffett is taking advantage of stock market participants who are foolish about the oil and gas industry and consider it a dead business‚Äù said Cole Smead president of Smead Capital Management Inc in Phoenix which owns Occidental and Berkshire shares. ‚ÄúBuffett thinks it can make him wealthy.‚Äù

Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to Buffett‚Äôs assistant.

Occidental spokesman Eric Moses said the higher ownership limit was ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù because the company owned assets subject to FERC regulation. It said the prior limit was 25%.

FERC‚Äôs authorization does not require Berkshire to buy any Occidental shares.

Some investors and analysts have nonetheless said Berkshire could eventually buy Occidental diversifying an energy portfolio that includes several utilities electricity distributors and renewable power projects including wind.

Buffett completed one of his biggest acquisitions the $26.5 billion purchase of the BNSF railroad in 2010 after Berkshire had amassed a 22.6% stake.

Takeover?

Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he ‚Äúliked Occidental more as a wholly-owned subsidiary under the Berkshire umbrella‚Äù because it would reduce Occidental‚Äôs costs to access capital and reduce exposure to commodity markets volatility.

Independent oil analyst Paul Sankey added that Occidental can benefit from the expanded tax credit for carbon-capture projects included in the Inflation Reduction Act signed this month by President Joe Biden.

‚ÄúI can see him taking the whole thing private‚Äù Sankey said referring to Buffett.

Smead in contrast said Buffett is unlikely to buy all of Occidental soon and can instead buy more shares on the open market at lower prices than in a full takeover.

‚ÄúIn the long run he may but you don‚Äôt file something like this with FERC if you‚Äôre planning it in the next six months‚Äù Smead said.

Berkshire ended June with $105.4 billion of cash and equivalents even after buying a net $45.2 billion of stocks in the year‚Äôs first half.

Buffett has pledged to keep $30 billion on hand. Occidental‚Äôs market value was about $66 billion after Friday‚Äôs run-up.

Berkshire owns more than 90 companies outright including Geico car insurance See‚Äôs Candies Dairy Queen ice cream and several manufacturing businesses.

At Berkshire‚Äôs annual meeting on April 30 Buffett said he began buying Occidental shares after reviewing an analyst presentation.

He also expressed confidence in Chief Executive Vicki Hollub who has been reducing Occidental‚Äôs debt.

‚ÄúShe says she doesn‚Äôt know the price of oil next year. Nobody does‚Äù Buffett said. ‚ÄúBut we decided it made sense.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vY3BpLXBvc3RzL3JlZ3VsYXRvci1va3MtYnVmZmV0dHMtYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LW9jY2lkZW50YWwtc3Rha2UtYnV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Regulator OKs Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Occidental Stake Buy,"A US energy regulator on Friday gave Berkshire Hathaway the company controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett permission to buy up to 50% of oil company Occidental Petroleum‚Äôs common stock.

Inflation Reduction Act









Famed investor Warren Buffett is steadily snowballing a stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp. in what could end up being his biggest-ever acquisition. His Berkshire Hathaway Inc. on Friday won approval to buy as much as 50% of the shares. Some investors believe it‚Äôs a step toward a full takeover which may end up costing more than $50 billion.Here‚Äôs why Occidental is attractive to Berkshire:Inflation looks to be the mega-trend for the first half of the 2020s and crude oil is one of the best natural hedges out there. Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and a lack of investment in new oilfields over the past five years have hit supplies leading to stagnant production profiles everywhere from OPEC to US shale. Meanwhile demand for fossil fuels has been strong coming out of the pandemic even as governments push for a switch to clean energy.With investments across the energy sector from utilities to solar power Buffett claims to be a realist in the debate around fossil fuels. ‚ÄúPeople that are on the extremes of both sides are a little nuts‚Äù he said at a Berkshire shareholder meeting in 2021.Buffett first invested in Occidental in 2019 when the oil company was in a bidding war with Chevron Corp. to buy its crosstown Houston rival Anadarko. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub flew to Omaha Nebraska on the company‚Äôs Gulfstream V and convinced Buffett to add $10 billion to her war chest. It was enough to swing the deal and Chevron pulled out soon after. In exchange Buffett got preferred shares yielding 8% annually plus warrants to buy more common stock at $59.62 apiece. Today with Occidental at $71.29 those warrants would turn a profit of more than $900 million if exercised.Initially the Anadarko deal was a disaster because it loaded up Occidental‚Äôs balance sheet with more than $30 billion of additional debt right before the pandemic. Occidental‚Äôs market value went from $50 billion before the 2019 transaction to less than $9 billion toward the end of 2020 as oil prices crashed.But on the flip side this created a good value play for Buffett. When crude turned around late last year and was supercharged by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine Occidental was best-placed to benefit. The stock is the best performer in the S&P 500 this year up more than 140% compared with the index‚Äôs 11% decline.‚ÄúOxy started this year heavily indebted with massive oil exposure‚Äù said Bill Smead who manages $4.8 billion at Smead Capital Management Inc. and is a top 20 shareholder in Occidental. Soaring crude prices mean ‚Äúthey‚Äôre now paying off that debt and gushing cash. It‚Äôs the best of all worlds.‚ÄùToo much cash has been Berkshire‚Äôs biggest investing challenge over the past few years. The conglomerate had about $105 billion on hand at the end of June. It is expected to generate about $8 billion in free cash flow each quarter for the next five years according to Greggory Warren of Morningstar Research Services LLC. Inflation at the highest in 40 years is a great incentive to put that money to work.Occidental would work better as a subsidiary of Berkshire than a stock holding ‚Äúgiven the volatility that exists in the energy/commodity markets‚Äù Warren said. ‚ÄúThis could end up though evolving into a slow-motion takeover where Berkshire buys up to the stakes that FERC allows it to acquire until it can acquire Oxy whole.‚ÄùOccidental is not only one of the biggest producers in the Permian Basin the largest US oilfield but it also has one of the lowest costs with an oil price of just $40 a barrel needed to sustain its dividend. West Texas Intermediate currently trades at about $90 a barrel. Hollub has reined in the ‚Äúdrill-baby-drill‚Äù mentality that characterized shale for the first decade of its lifespan and is now prioritizing profits over production. Free cash flow hit a record $4.2 billion in the second quarter.The Anadarko purchase may have been expensive but it allowed Occidental to lift its land holdings in the Permian to 2.8 million acres 14 times the size of New York City‚Äôs five boroughs combined. It also added steady cash-flowing assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Algeria.Buffett has a good personal relationship with Hollub which began at the 2019 meeting in Omaha brokered by Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan. This year the veteran investor praised Hollub after reading a transcript of Occidental‚Äôs Feb. 25 earnings conference call in which she pledged financial discipline even as oil prices were rising.‚ÄúI read every word and said this is exactly what I would be doing‚Äù Buffett told CNBC‚Äôs Becky Quick in ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù in March. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs running the company the right way.‚ÄùThe oil industry mostly criticized the Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law this month. The $437 billion legislation ‚Äúdiscourages needed investment in oil and gas‚Äù and offers ‚Äúthe wrong policies at the wrong time‚Äù the American Petroleum Institute said.But Hollub was surprisingly upbeat calling the bill ‚Äúvery positive.‚Äù That may have something to do with its expansion of tax credits for carbon capture of which Occidental is a leading proponent. The company has plans to build the world‚Äôs biggest direct air capture plant which will command a tax credit of as much as $180 for each ton of carbon sucked out of the air.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmFpdHN0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tcGFuaWVzLW1hcmtldHMvaGVyZXMtd2h5LXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LWxvdmVzLW9pbC1naWFudC1vY2NpZGVudGFsLXBldHJvbGV1bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's why Warren Buffett loves oil giant Occidental Petroleum,"NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG REUTERS) - Famed investor Warren Buffett is steadily snowballing a stake in Occidental Petroleum in what could end up being his biggest acquisition.

Here is why Occidental is attractive to Berkshire:

Oil

Inflation looks to be the megatrend for the first half of the 2020s and crude oil is one of the best natural hedges out there. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a lack of investment in new oilfields over the past five years have hit supplies leading to stagnant production profiles everywhere from Opec to US shale.

Meanwhile demand for fossil fuels has been strong coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic even as governments push for a switch to clean energy.

With investments across the energy sector from utilities to solar power Mr Buffett claims to be a realist in the debate around fossil fuels.

""People that are on the extremes of both sides are a little nuts"" he said at a Berkshire shareholder meeting in 2021.

Born and raised in VA Beach to Nick and Penny Durney. Nick graduated and wrestled with Kempsville High School where his team went on to win the State Championship. Nick graduated from Old Dominion University with a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Marketing. We knew Nick was intelligent at a very young age when he was accelerated into the gifted program in elementary school and played the violin. Nick was exceptional with numbers and stats. He was talented and could do anything he set his mind to. He had a knack for sales finance and helping people. He followed in his father‚Äôs footsteps and sold cars for 14 yrs. at Mike Duman Auto Sales. For the past 3 yrs. he was an EMT for Sentra and an Enrollment specialist at Optima Health.

Nick was a sports enthusiast he was a great wrestler loved surfing and being on the beach with his family playing golf poker and most of all watching football. He was a super Steelers fan it all started when he was a kid playing flag football and his team was named the Steelers. The Steelers were in the super bowl that year and his loyalty to that team is history. This time of year he would start getting all the stats talking to all his friends to get his fantasy football team lined up. He loved the game and enjoyed the competition.

Nick had a passion for music of all kinds he was open to listen to anything that made him feel good and vibe. Nick was always looking for the next concert and festival to go to or dance floor to boogie on. He was a special human and could connect to anyone through music and did. He met so many people through the years that he touched with his open and generous soul.

Nick would say his greatest accomplishment is his daughter Ilana. He loved her more than anything in this world. He raised her on his own for most of her life and was making plans to change careers to go be with her in Sarasota. He was looking forward to this next chapter with her. Nick will be missed by many and all he touched he had a zest for life and a good time. Most of all Nick had a big heart and was always there with a helping hand.

If you were lucky enough to be one of Nick‚Äôs friends you have that bond that will be cherished forever.

Kevin Reihner was promoted on Sunday to offensive coordinator while keeping his duties as offensive line coach.

He replaces Dave Patenaude who resigned his position on August 12 just three weeks before the season kicks off.

Reihner is in his third season with the Monarchs but this is not the first time he's called plays for ODU. He had that responsibility during the Myrtle Beach Bowl a season ago.

Rahne also promoted three other coaches; wide receivers coach Mark Dupuis is now the pass game coordinator running backs coach Tony Lucas adds assistant head coach duties and tight ends coach Justin Harper has been named offensive recruiting coordinator.

Additionally Greg Jones is being brought onto staff as an assistant offensive line coach. Jones was previously at Wake Forest for six seasons where held numerous roles including offensive and defensive analysts and a linebackers coach.

""We are excited to add Coach Jones to our program‚Äù Rahne said. ""He has a wide array of experience and expertise that will be extremely valuable and his proven track record of recruiting will also be a tremendous asset.""

Three schools (Marshall Southern Miss Old Dominion) left for the Sun Belt this year and six more will leave for the American next year when four new schools will join C-USA. But what does that mean for 2022? It means there are no divisions in the 11-team league. It could be a two-horse race at the top but a bunch of teams should contend for bowl eligibility again (eight of 14 played in bowl games last year).

What should you keep an eye on this season? Here are picks predictions and questions.

Biggest storyline: What does WKU look like post-Bailey Zappe?

In one season with the Hilltoppers Zappe broke the NCAA single-season records for passing yards and passing touchdowns. Now he‚Äôs in the NFL. So is receiver Jerreth Sterns. Offensive coordinator Zach Kittley went to Texas Tech. So did offensive line coach Stephen Hamby. Head coach Tyson Helton‚Äôs experiment importing much of an FCS offense from Houston Baptist worked beautifully and it could become a trend in the sport. The Hilltoppers have won nine games in two of the past three years in very different ways and they will have a new look. What will their identity be? It could determine if they can challenge UTSA and UAB for the league crown.

Top three nonconference games

SMU at North Texas (Sept. 3)

Houston at UTSA (Sept. 3)

Western Kentucky at Indiana (Sept. 17)

UNT won its final five regular-season games last year and opens with a big DFW rivalry game against SMU. UTSA‚Äôs home opener against Houston is one of the biggest intra-G5 matchups of the year with both teams favored to win conference titles. WKU nearly beat Indiana a year ago narrowly losing 33-31. It could be C-USA‚Äôs best shot at a Power 5 win this year.

Top three conference games

Western Kentucky at UTSA (Oct. 8)

UAB at Western Kentucky (Oct. 21)

UTSA at UAB (Nov. 5)

These three teams could be the best in the league and their regular-season matchups will be huge. WKU and UTSA will meet in a C-USA championship game rematch their third game in two seasons. Could there be a fourth in December? UAB has to go to WKU in late October and then hosts UTSA two weeks later. The Blazers want to get back to the C-USA title game and those two games could determine if that happens.

Breakout player: FIU WR Tyrese Chambers

Chambers finished second nationally in yards per catch (23.87) with 1074 yards on 45 receptions. That was a single-season FIU yardage record as were his nine touchdowns. The Golden Panthers have a new coaching staff under head coach Mike MacIntyre and an up-tempo offense led by offensive coordinator David Yost should only benefit Chambers who can put up even bigger numbers and earn broader recognition.

Offensive player of the year: UTSA QB Frank Harris

Finally healthy Harris threw for 3161 yards with 27 touchdowns and six interceptions and ran for 561 yards and six more TDs last year. Head coach Jeff Traylor called Harris the most improved player he‚Äôs ever coached. With his top five receivers back and questions at running back this should be more of a passing attack and Harris is primed for a big sixth and final season.

Defensive player of the year: North Texas LB KD Davis

Davis briefly entered the transfer portal in late June but a few days later he opted to stay at UNT. The fifth-year senior earned first-team all-conference honors after racking up 121 tackles 13 TFLs 5.5 sacks two fumble recoveries (one for a touchdown) and seven quarterback hurries. He‚Äôs led the Mean Green in tackles for three consecutive years. UNT‚Äôs defense must improve again this season (78th in scoring in 2021) but Davis is a bright spot.

KD Davis has totaled 288 career tackles. (Chuck Cook / USA Today)

Conference sleeper: Charlotte

The 49ers return nearly 90 percent of their offensive production led by fifth-year starting quarterback Chris Reynolds. This should be one of the better offenses in the league. The defensive staff was overhauled after a rough year. If that unit can show moderate improvement Charlotte could surprise people.

Projected standings

1. UTSA

The Roadrunners were perhaps the biggest surprise in the country in 2021 nearly completing an undefeated regular season winning C-USA and finishing 12-2. Star running back Sincere McCormick is gone but nine starters are back from an offense that scored 36.9 points per game 11th best nationally. Harris and receivers Zakhari Franklin Joshua Cephus and De‚ÄôCorian Clark make a formidable group. The defense must have new leaders emerge but the Roadrunners are the favorite to repeat. The conference schedule is favorable with WKU and UTEP and home though the trip to UAB is the big one.

2. UAB

Head coach Bill Clark who led the Blazers to C-USA titles in 2018 and 2020 stepped away in late June due to chronic back issues and offensive coordinator Bryant Vincent was promoted to head coach. The defense should be among the league‚Äôs best again as was a staple under Clark. Running backs DeWayne McBride (1371 yards) and Jermaine Brown Jr. (631 yards) form the best backfield in the league. Receiver Trea Shropshire who led the nation in yards per catch (26.0) should be the No. 1 option this year.

3. Western Kentucky

The record-setting offense has been replaced with the offensive coordinator offensive line coach quarterback top receivers and top running back gone. West Florida transfer QB Austin Reed beat out West Virginia transfer QB Jarret Doege who then entered the transfer portal. Will enough pieces emerge around Reed? Last year‚Äôs defense finished 92nd in scoring and 75th in yards per play allowed and new defensive coordinator Tyson Summers has a lot to fix. The schedule is tricky with both UTSA and UAB on the slate plus trips to Hawaii and Indiana and then Auburn in late November.

4. UTEP

The Miners reached their first bowl in seven years last season and a lot returns. Though top receiver Jacob Cowing transferred to Arizona quarterback Gavin Hardison (3223 yards and 18 TDs) is back and the running game should be in good shape. UTEP finished 89th in scoring but second nationally in plays of 40-plus yards. The defense has improved from 119th in scoring in 2019 to 53rd last year. The conference schedule is also favorable as the Miners avoid UAB and WKU and don‚Äôt face UTSA until the finale. The Week 0 opener against UNT is a big one for both teams.

5. North Texas

UNT started 1-6 last year but a switch in offensive philosophy to run the ball more helped lead the Mean Green to five consecutive wins including one win against 11-0 UTSA to reach a bowl game. The team averaged 283 rushing yards per game in the winning streak which also helped the defense stay off the field. The No. 1 running back spot is open with Ikaika Ragsdale and Ayo Adeyi back after combining for 1030 yards and Oscar Adaway returning from an injury that cost him 2021. The 28-year-old Austin Aune has won the QB battle again. The defense improved from the rock bottom season of 2020 but with only four starters back new stars must emerge alongside Davis.

6. FAU

The Owls started 5-3 last year before four consecutive losses cost them a bowl game. The offense failed to score 20 points in any of those games. With sixth-year quarterback N‚ÄôKosi Perry and his top receivers back along with running backs Johnny Ford (831 yards) and Larry McCammon III and a new offensive coordinator in Brent Dearmon the offense should improve. Only four defensive starters return and a new starting secondary must emerge. The Week 0 home game against Charlotte is a huge one.

7. Charlotte

The sleeper team led by fifth-year starting quarterback Chris Reynolds and C-USA freshman of the year receiver Elijah Spencer should be improved on offense. The overhauled defense must be better in order to make a leap after finishing 114th in scoring last year. The first half of the schedule is tricky. The Week 0 trip to Florida Atlantic and an FCS game are followed by nonconference games against Maryland (at home) Georgia State and South Carolina then UTEP and UAB in conference play.

8. Middle Tennessee

The Blue Raiders won five of their last seven to close 2021 including a Bahamas Bowl win against Toledo but this could be more of a rebuilding year. New offensive coordinator Mitch Stewart comes from Samford and brings an Air Raid attack and receiver Jaylin Lane could have a big year if the offense finds a quarterback and clicks. Senior defensive end Jordan Ferguson (nine sacks) anchors a defense that lost key defensive backs to the portal. From late September to mid-October MTSU plays Miami (Fla.) UTSA UAB and WKU in four consecutive weeks but outside of that the schedule is manageable.

9. Louisiana Tech

The Bulldogs had played in seven consecutive bowls under Skip Holtz but a coaching change was made after a 3-9 season. (Holtz then won the USFL championship this spring.) Sonny Cumbie arrived after a successful stint as Texas Tech‚Äôs interim head coach and has brought a lot of energy. TCU transfer Matthew Downing is the likely starter and he has a deep receiving corps in what should be a strong passing attack. Last year‚Äôs defense finished 114th in scoring and new defensive coordinator Scott Power comes from Stephen F. Austin. Trips to Missouri and Clemson make for a tough nonconference slate and the C-USA schedule does no favors either.

10. Rice

Mike Bloomgren heads into his fifth year as head coach and hasn‚Äôt been able to find consistency with an 11-31 record. Quarterback injuries every year haven‚Äôt helped. Former QB Luke McCaffrey has moved to wide receiver and Ari Broussard leads a capable group of running backs. The defense is experienced with seven returning starters but it finished 120th in scoring last year. The schedule is a tough hurdle with nonconference games against USC Louisiana and Houston plus games against all the expected top teams in C-USA.

11. FIU

New head coach Mike MacIntyre has a history of successful rebuilds at San Jose State and Colorado and FIU is 1-16 over the past two years including 18 consecutive losses to FBS opponents. Just four starters are back though Chambers is a weapon as a big-play receiver. This will be a long-term project but former head coach Butch Davis showed that winning is possible here.

His leg had been broken his knee ligaments torn to shreds and he was bleeding profusely. For the time being he was feeling little pain and didn't know how badly he was injured.



Minutes earlier Vidal and his Old Dominion men's tennis teammates had been celebrating. They hosted the ITA Atlantic Super Regionals earlier in the day and Vidal teamed with Luca Maldoner a junior from Austria to win the title by defeating the University of Virginia's top doubles team.



ODU's Francois Le Tallec also won the singles title on what had simply been a glorious day for the Monarchs.



They went out to dinner and then stopped at a convenience store to pick up some chips and soft drinks and continue the celebration at Vidal's house.



But as he stood outside the store watching his teammates Vidal suddenly began to feel uneasy.



""Out of nowhere I heard a car turn on"" he said. ""I heard wheels screeching. I turned my head and saw a car was headed towards me.""



He didn't have time to move and the car plowed into his leg. The driver then slammed the car into reverse and fled the scene.



As he lay on the ground Vidal saw blood gushing from his leg but said he didn't immediately comprehend the seriousness of what was happening. Blood was pooling all around him and for a few moments no one knew what to do.



Fortunately Perrin Priest happened to be in the parking lot and the Norfolk native and Eastern Shore resident calmly took over and administered first aid that may have saved Vidal's life.



It wasn't until hours later that coaches and players learned that their teammate would live.



And that was just the first act in what was a nightmarish 2021-22 for the Monarchs.



Le Tallec the junior from suburban Paris France tore his meniscus just weeks later and needed surgery. He returned in the spring but says he wasn't himself.



""I was rehabbing the entire spring"" he said.



In February Russia invaded Ukraine and while it was thousands of miles from ODU tennis player Yevhen Sirous is a native of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine.



His family had moved to Lviv which has largely escaped the war. But his wife's family was in Kharkiv when the war began and spent months hiding in cellars.



Sirous and fellow Ukrainian Yuliia Starodubtseva the No. 1 singles player on the women's tennis team spent the entire spring season and every day since worrying about their families.



""After every practice after every match Yevhen got on his phone to see if his family was safe"" head coach Dominik Mueller said. ""I can't imagine what he was going through.""



Later on Maldoner injured his knee in a match against Florida Atlantic. He was leading his match and was about to clinch a victory when he had to retire. The Monarchs finished the season with five players.



It speaks to the terrible hardships his team endured last school year that whenever I've asked Mueller about it he sheds tears.



""This team has been through so much"" he said. ""But this group never gave up.





ODU Men's Tennis Star Nicola Vidal



""Look at the resume of this team with all the stuff that's gone on. They've shown so much character.""



Especially Vidal.



""Without Nicola and his great attitude I don't know whether we would have been able to hold the team together.""



Vidal now realizes that the accident could have been fatal. But as he tells the story of that day the junior from Bagnaria Arsa Italy does so in relaxed fashion and without histrionics.



He was briefly trapped between the car and a cement trash can and when the car pulled out he then fell to the ground. Le Tallec held his hand and assured him everything was going to be OK even though he acknowledges he was terribly worried about his teammate and friend.



""When it first happened I didn't really know what was going on"" Vidal said. ""I saw blood going everywhere so I knew I was severely injured. But I had so much adrenaline the pain was secondary.



""My teammates were shocked and didn't know what to do.""



Fortunately Priest happened to be at the same store with a friend. Priest is a fervent outdoorsman and a former Eagle Scout. He's killed many a deer but said he never witnessed an injury like Vidal's.



""When Nico took a step back his leg looked like Jello"" Priest said. ""I've never seen anything lose blood like that. It looked like a beer tap.""



He immediately took control. A young Navy sailor who didn't leave his name also stopped to help. Priest told the players to get every napkin they could find in the store.



""We shoved napkins in his leg and that didn't stop the bleeding"" Priest said. ""So I took off my belt and started a tourniquet.



""Even with the tourniquet applied he was still losing blood at an alarming rate.""



Fortunately it only took a few minutes for the Norfolk Fire/Rescue truck to arrive. Paramedics quickly realized it was a serious situation and hurriedly put Vidal into the ambulance.



""The pain started in the ambulance"" Vidal said. He asked the paramedics to give him something for the pain but they declined.



""They told me 'If we give you something for the pain we have to keep you here and stabilize you'"" he said. ""They told me I was bleeding too badly and they had to get me to the hospital.



""The pain just got worse and worse. I was beginning to realize how badly hurt I was.""



Yet the worst was still to come. When he arrived at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital he was rushed into the Emergency Room where a doctor quickly began working to stop the bleeding without so much as giving him an aspirin tablet for pain.



""I didn't know what he was doing"" Vidal said. ""He was moving my legs and I screamed at him to please stop because it hurt so much. It was the worst pain I've ever felt.



""He had an armful of blood. He looked at me and said 'I can't stop. You're bleeding too much.'



""That was maybe the worst moment.""



Minutes later he was under anesthesia and undergoing emergency surgery. The surgeon didn't set his broken leg or repair damage to ligaments and tendons. The priority was to stop the bleeding and make sure blood was flowing to his lower leg and foot.



Meanwhile Mueller and his wife had been alerted by players and rushed to Norfolk General. However because of federal privacy laws it would be hours before they knew Vidal was OK.



""It took us an hour to find out that he was alive"" Mueller said.



Mueller texted Vidal's parents in Italy but was vague about the severity of the injury because he simply didn't have much information.



Because Mueller and his teammates aren't family federal laws prohibited hospital officials from providing much information. That was frustrating and prolonged the agony for Mueller and his players.



""I finally got to see him at 2 a.m."" Mueller said. ""And he was so positive.



""I came back the next day and his first question was 'How do I redshirt?'""







Mueller said the question spoken with such optimism after such a terrible needless injury made him choke up.



""I said 'Niko you're a slam dunk redshirt.' He then said 'I'm going to redshirt. I want to come back. I want to play.'



""His mindset helped the whole team because they saw even after this happened to him he was so positive.



""I don't know if we would have overcome all of the adversity in the spring if it had not been for the example Nico set for us in the fall.""



In fact before talking to Vidal the players were leaning toward canceling the fall season.



""But once they visited Nico at the hospital it brought a sense of calmness over them"" said Bruce Stewart ODU's deputy athletic director and COO.



""Once they talked to him they said 'We're good. We'll be back on the court tomorrow.' ""



Vidal called his parents and assured them he was going to be OK even though at that point he wasn't absolutely sure. It would take time for doctors to determine if he could make a full recovery.



Athletic Director Dr. Wood Selig and Stewart who overseas ODU's two tennis teams football and men's basketball were also at the hospital and offered to fly his parents to Norfolk.



""They wanted to come but I told them that I was coming home for Christmas and it would be better if I saw them then"" Vidal said.



He knew he would be in much better condition in two months.



A couple of days after he was injured doctors did a second surgery to set the bone and repair the torn ligaments and tendons. The surgery was successful.



Rehabilitation was a painful process although in the spring he wasn't lonely when he went to seek treatment from ODU athletic trainer Rachelle Bowman. Le Tallec and Maldoner were also undergoing rehab.



""They worked me overtime"" Bowman said with a smile. ""Nico made a remarkable recovery. It wasn't easy for him. He was just so determined to come back.""



While Mueller credits Vidal with helping the team survive the nightmarish school year Vidal credits his coach.



""I'm very lucky that he's my coach"" he said. ""His knowledge of tennis is unbelievable.



""But that's almost a secondary thing for him. He's a very deep human. He really cares about all of us. He cares about our emotions all that we're feeling.



""He's helped us through the hard times. He's been through it all as a tennis player. The fact that he engages with you in those moments is not something every coach does.



""That's the difference between a good coach and a great coach.""



Sirous and his wife Daria received good news late last spring when they learned her mother grandfather and their beloved cat had escaped Kharkiv and were able to travel to western Poland.





Daria and Yevhen Sirous



Before they escaped Sirous said Daria rarely slept and often spent hours crying after talking to her mother.



Toward the end her mother said she became so accustomed to missiles and artillery shells falling nearby that she learned to identify them all by the sound they made as they soared through the air.



""It's so hard to watch the person who you're closest to in the world cry every night"" Sirous said. ""When we learned they had escaped it was one of the happiest days of our lives.""



Like everyone at the accident scene Priest was initially in shock. It was long after the ambulance had left that he realized the seriousness of what happened.



""At the time it didn't seem real"" he said. ""I'm thankful that I was able to remain calm and do what I knew had to be done.""



The Norfolk paramedics told Le Tallec that if Priest had not applied a tourniquet to his leg the night could have been tragically different.



""I think maybe he saved his leg or even his life"" he said. ""He was amazing. He took charge. He knew exactly what to do.""



Le Tallec recalls walking home that night after the ambulance took Vidal away.



""You don't think too much about it at the moment but when I walked home I couldn't speak"" he said. ""I couldn't talk any more. I was thinking 'How could that happen? Why did this happen?



""It's not possible it's just not possible.'



""I was replaying the scene over and over in my head.""



The driver who ran the car into Vidal was eventually arrested by Norfolk Police. It is not believed that he targeted Vidal or that he intentionally drove into him.



The back of Vidal's leg remains scarred but he says he's at full strength and ready for a good year. Vidal said the resiliency his teammates showed last spring was remarkable especially Sirous.



""It was the hardest thing that could have happened to a player"" he said of Sirous. ""It touched his whole family his city where he's living.



""It's still happening. I give him so much credit for getting through last year.""





Coach Dominik Mueller with Francois Le Tallec



Vidal said all that he and his teammates went through last school year is motivation for the upcoming fall and spring seasons.



""I think all of us appreciate more the opportunity to play tennis"" he said. ""We're going to hustle more play harder do that last set in the gym that maybe you weren't doing last year.



""You want to work hard for something bigger.""



Le Tallec said they would not have made it through the year without Mueller's leadership.



""We're very strong mentally and that comes from Dom"" he said. ""No matter what happened he was always calm. He always had the right message.



""Because of Dom we're strong guys and we just don't quit. No matter what happens we're going to keep playing and try to finish higher.""



A native of Frankfrut Germany Mueller said last school year was unlike any he's ever experienced or heard of any other college team being forced to endure.



""What happened is going to be a part of our lives forever"" he said. ""Three major injuries and then a war. The chances of that all happening in the same year are astronomical. The only thing we didn't have was a COVID outbreak.



""The players reacted so well to adversity. Obviously there was some frustration. They asked 'Why is this happening to us?'





Nicola Vidal's scars remain but otherwise he's made a full recovery



""But they always put that behind them and gave their best. They never complained. That's the correct attitude to have when you face adversity. You're going to face adversity in life. Doing so with the correct attitude prepares you for life.



""I'm so proud of them every one of them. They gave me so much more than I gave them.""



In spite of all of the hardships the Monarchs were ranked 64th nationally an amazing fete for a team without three of their top players and with Sirous so terribly weighed down by the war in his homeland. Le Tallec also made the NCAA Tournament in singles.



Stewart said it was Mueller's best coaching performance better even than years in which the Monarchs went to the NCAA Tournament and finished in the Top 25.



""This took such a toll on Dominik"" Stewart said. ""He really cares about his players. It came to a point where I had to pull him over and let him know it's going to be OK we're all in this together.



""This was easily Dom's best season as a coach. You can't measure what he did by wins and losses.



""The impact he made on these young men is something that will be with them their entire lives.""

ON,ON Semiconductor,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGlwbG9tYXQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvY2hpbmFzLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItYnJlYWt0aHJvdWdoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's Semiconductor Breakthrough ‚Äì The Diplomat,"Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) the largest chipmaker in China has reportedly achieved a major breakthrough. TechInsight a Canadian tech media outlet revealed that SMIC had advanced its technology to a quasi-7-nanometer (nm) process which might be a stepping stone for a true 7nm process. According to TechInsight SMIC products made from the quasi-7nm process had been shipped for a year. Some media argued that the SMIC‚Äôs advancement showed that the U.S. blockade was too little too late and out of date.

SMIC‚Äôs most advanced chip process node successfully made in the past was 14nm although it has always made strong attempts to move toward an advanced process node (below 10nm). However due to SMIC‚Äôs inclusion on the Entity List by the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security in December 2020 which was designed to limit SMIC‚Äôs ability to reach advanced technology nodes of 10 nanometers or below it has been blocked from obtaining the necessary Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) machines from ASML of the Netherlands.

The use of an EUV machine is not necessary in theory to make the advanced process nodes. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) the global leader in semiconductor manufacturing used Deep Ultraviolet Lithography (DUV) machines in the early stage of its 7nm volume production. But using DUV machines requires more layers of masks which means more times of exposure and more complexity. This will lead to a lower yield rate and a higher cost for each chip making such a process commercially inviable nowadays.

But the semiconductor industry is of a strategic importance for China. Having the capacity to make advanced chips is more important than the prices of these chips. It appears that SMIC is indeed moving ahead to use this older technology to achieve technological breakthroughs. In October 2020 it was reported that SMIC had successfully developed ‚Äúquasi-7nm‚Äù chips with the FinFET N+1 process using DUV machines.

TSMC‚Äôs chairman Dr. Mark Liu said that the 7nm process was a full node stride and a watershed in semiconductor manufacturing. The biggest difference between the 7nm and 14nm processes is that the number of transistors per unit area of the 7nm process increases greatly and its energy consumption is reduced substantially. These makes 7nm chips far more powerful than 14nm one yet also more economical. For example in 2020 the cost of a 7nm chip was $233 which was not only lower than the $331 cost of a 16nm chip but also lower than the $238 cost of a 5nm chip. In addition the performance of NVIDIA‚Äôs A100 Tensor Core data-center processor which uses TSMC‚Äôs 7nm process increased by 20 times so that the data center which originally required 25 racks can be reduced to a single rack.

In other words 7nm chips not only lower the cost of ownership but also deliver high computing performance which makes AI cloud computing and 5G economically viable both in business and military applications.

China‚Äôs Semiconductor Industry Sprints to Improve Self-Sufficiency

There is a big gap between chip consumption and chip manufacturing in China meaning its chip self-sufficiency rate is low. In 2021 the size of China‚Äôs semiconductor market was about $186.5 billion of which only $31.2 billion worth of chips were manufactured in China both by foreign and domestic companies ‚Äì a self-sufficiency rate of 16.7 percent. Furthermore only $12.3 billion worth of chips were manufactured by China-headquartered companies accounting for merely 6.6 percent of domestic consumption.

To reach the goal outlined by the ‚ÄúMade in China 2025‚Äù initiative a self-sufficiency rate of 75 percent needs to be achieved by 2030. Under such pressure it is not difficult to understand why China has subsidized semiconductor companies to build factories through various policy incentives. While there are notorious ‚Äúunfinished fabs‚Äù cases in the development of the semiconductor industry the failure has not caused China to retreat from its policy to fully support semiconductor factories.

The experience of developing the electronics industry in the past has made Chinese policy planners understand that even though China‚Äôs semiconductor industry lags behind foreign manufacturers in terms of its production scale and technology there are two effects that will urge China to support a large number of semiconductor companies through policies. First a large number of Chinese manufacturers can ‚Äúeat up‚Äù the market and compress the space for second- and third-tier wafer foundries. According to one report by the end of 2024 China will be leading the world by building new 31 chip factories surpassing 19 in Taiwan and 12 in the United States. Since most of the 31 new factories in China will be making mature processes nodes there is little impact on the leading manufacturers such as TSMC Intel and Samsung all of which use advanced processes. However China‚Äôs ‚Äúfab sea‚Äù tactic may exert huge pressure on other mature process manufacturers.

Given that excess inventory has emerged in some areas of the electronics industry and the market expects that there will be excess production capacity in chip manufacturing after 2023 price competition is inevitable. Foundries using mature processes will not be able to compete with Chinese semiconductor factories that enjoy major policy subsidies. Some second- and third-tier foundries may have to withdraw from the market which will allow Chinese foundries to dominate the mature process market.

Second if one or two Chinese companies can stand out among the large number of policy-supported foundries there is a hope that this ‚Äúnational champion‚Äù can compete or even dominate the advanced process market. Lenovo in the PC/laptop sector and Huawei and ZTE in communications were all developed using such a model. And SMIC may be the leading Chinese company that can compete in the international advanced semiconductor arena and break technology strangleholds set by the United States. The 7nm advancement discovered by TechInsight is the best proof.

In the past Chinese chip design companies were sanctioned by the United States and could not use TSMC‚Äôs advanced process to launch new products. If SMIC can extend the 7nm process to be used on other Chinese manufacturers‚Äô products it will allow China to accelerate its advancement in AI high-speed computing and 5G etc. The acceleration will enable China to achieve its goal of moving from a ‚Äúmanufacturing giant‚Äù to a ‚Äúworld manufacturing power.‚Äù

The Effectiveness of Entity List Needs to be Reassessed

We currently know very little about SMIC‚Äôs 7nm shipments yield rates and prices; it is not even clear whether there are other applications. However the advancement of the 7nm process is expected to allow China to make breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and high-speed computing. In turn that will also increase China‚Äôs economic and military threats to not only Taiwan but all of East Asia.

China has set goals to achieve ‚Äúcomplete modernization‚Äù based on ‚Äúinformatization‚Äù ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù and ‚Äúmechanization‚Äù by the People‚Äôs Liberation Army‚Äôs 100th anniversary in 2027. Breakthroughs in AI quantum computing and hypersonics all require the assistance of advanced chips. Only blocking China from acquiring EUV machines will not prevent China from advancing in advanced process chips which will eventually help its military buildup. More efforts are needed.

The United States is now trying to exert diplomatic pressure on Japan and the Netherlands to extend the current EUV embargo to include DUV machines. Some may argue that isolating China will only accelerate its march to self-sufficiency. From the past history of China‚Äôs industrialization China‚Äôs ambition will not stop until the country dominates the entire market. Therefore only limiting China from obtaining EUV machines will not suit the original purpose of keeping China from making advanced technology nodes of 10nm or below.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZGVpbmRpYW5hYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2hvbGNvbWItb24tdHJpcC10by10YWl3YW4tc291dGgta29yZWEtaW4tc2VhcmNoLW9mLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItYmF0dGVyeS1pbnZlc3RtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Holcomb on trip to Taiwan South Korea in search of semiconductor battery investment ‚Äì Inside INdiana Business,"Holcomb on trip to Taiwan South Korea in search of semiconductor battery investment

Governor Eric Holcomb and a delegation that includes Secretary of Commerce Brad Chambers and Purdue University officials are in Asia as part of the state‚Äôs amped-up efforts to attract investment from semiconductor and electric vehicle battery companies. The week-long economic development trip begins Monday in Taiwan home to some of the world‚Äôs largest semiconductor companies. Holcomb is the first U.S. governor to visit Taiwan in three years and believes Indiana can become a center for semiconductor research and production.

‚ÄúI would go so far as to say I know that we can and we are because we are on that path right now‚Äù said Holcomb in an interview on Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick recorded before the trip. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be talking to industry giants‚Äù said Holcomb. ‚ÄúThat Indiana seeks to be a leader in this space and these industries of the future is not just on a slick flyer we want to triple down and part of going to Taiwan will be to sell the state of Indiana and to show all that we have to offer.‚Äù

The trip will include the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Taiwan and Indiana creating a framework to remove barriers to trade and investment. The MOU is similar to one signed with the United Kingdom in May at the state‚Äôs first Global Economic Summit.

The delegation will also visit South Korea for meetings with business and government leaders and a focus on electric vehicle battery production.

The trip comes on the heels of major economic development announcements the Governor believes are the beginning of what could be a wave of tech investment in the state.

In June Taiwan-based MediaTek Inc. the world‚Äôs fourth-largest semiconductor company announced plans to establish a chip design center on Purdue University‚Äôs West Lafayette campus its first partnership with an American university. It will focus on chip design in engineering education as well as joint research into next-generation chips.

MediaTek employs more than 19000 people worldwide and plans to begin hiring for electrical engineering and chip design positions in West Lafayette soon.

Less than a month later Minnesota-based SkyWater Technology (Nasdaq: SKYT) announced plans to build a $1.8 billion semiconductor R&D and production facility at Purdue‚Äôs Discovery Park a project expected to create 750 jobs over five years.

SkyWater bills itself as the only U.S.-investor owned pure-play semiconductor and technology foundry. The company has approximately 600 employees and went public in April 2021 raising nearly $100 million in its initial public offering.

Speaking with reporters after the announcement SkyWater Chief Executive Officer Thomas Sonderman said he believes over time Indiana can become the ‚ÄúSilicon Heartland.‚Äù

Purdue‚Äôs College of Engineering Dean Mark Lundstrom is part of the Asian delegation and will be participating in meetings in Taiwan. Purdue President-elect Mung Chiang will join the delegation when it arrives in South Korea.

While in Seoul the group will meet with executives from numerous companies including Samsung.

In May Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and Samsung SDI announced plans for a $2.5 billion joint venture electric vehicle battery plant in Kokomo that is expected to create 1400 jobs.

The plant will supply batteries for a range of electric vehicles produced at Stellantis‚Äô assembly plants throughout North America and the investment could grow to $3.1 billion as the automaker ramps up EV production.

Additionally Inside Indiana Business has confirmed a massive electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant could be coming to St. Joseph County.

Ultium Cells LLC a joint venture between General Motors Co. and LG Energy Solution has filed a tax abatement application with the county for a facility in New Carlisle. Based on investments in similar projects elsewhere it could mean a more than $2 billion investment and more than 1000 jobs.

In a statement Ultium spokesperson Brooke Waid confirmed the company is ‚Äúdeveloping a competitive business case for a potential large investment that could be located in New Carlisle‚Äù and that the tax abatement application was filed.

‚ÄúUltium Cells with the support of GM officials are in discussions with the appropriate local officials on the abatement application‚Äù Waid said. ‚ÄúWe look forward to the application being reviewed and hopefully approved later this month. Securing an approved tax abatement is a critical step of the project moving forward. We are not going to disclose any additional details of the projects than those included in the abatement application.‚Äù

If approved the project would be built in the Indiana Enterprise Center development area near New Carlisle.

As designed the molecular structure DFT-calculated molecular conformation and frontier orbitals of AZO-BTBT-8 are shown in Fig. 1a. AZO-BTBT-8 mainly presents as planar trans conformation in the ambient environment while the UV light triggered the isomerization to cis conformation with benzene rings tilted to each other. This photoisomerization slightly increases the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) benefiting the energy level alignment with electrode Au (‚àí5.1 eV) in the top-contact/bottom-gate device architecture (Fig. 1b).

The orbital values are obtained from DFT calculations (black solid line Supplementary Table 2) CV (Supplementary Fig. 6) and UV ‚àí Vis absorptions measurements (red dashed line for solution samples and purple solid line for solid films Supplementary Table 3).

All the experiments are conducted with spinning-coated film samples annealed at 80¬∞C unless otherwise stated. The thermodynamic properties of the bulk material were first investigated. Supplementary Fig. 2a shows the breakdown temperature of 340¬∞C demonstrating strong thermal stability which is a critical requirement for OFET electronics. According to the differential scanning calorimetry plots (DSC Supplementary Fig. 2b) liquid crystals and Maltese crosses were revealed by polarized optical microscope (POM) in the incubation at 80¬∞C (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). Thus to optimize molecular packing in thin-film devices an annealing temperature of 80 ¬∞C (30 min Supplementary Fig. 5) was selected to help with the molecular rearrangement2728. AZO-BTBT-8 thin film was further examined with atomic force microscope (AFM). As shown in Fig. 2a the film of AZO-BTBT-8 shows good continuity and flatness with molecular step edges which is suitable for electronic device fabrication. After exposure to UV light (365 nm 20 mW‚àôcm-2) for two hours the average step height of the surface monolayer decreased from 3.11 to 2.85 nm (Fig. 2b) which is consistent with the DFT calculated value (27.2 √Ö to 24.9 √Ö difference of 2.3 √Ö Supplementary Fig. 16) and indicates the complete photoisomerization on the film surface. The time-dependent UV-Vis experiment is then conducted to investigate the photoisomerization kinetics showing the reversible photoisomerization of AZO-BTBT-8 in both solid film and solution (Supplementary Figs. 9a and 10). However compared to the solution (Supplementary Fig. 9b) the thin films sample (800 nm Fig. 2d) shows a much weaker response which can be attributed to the steric hindrance in the condensed phase29. Due to the steric hindrance a fraction of the molecules is triggered for photoisomerization inside the film under UV irradiation in contrast to almost 100% on the surface. Therefore the heterogeneous conformational change in the film is predictable with higher conversion ratio towards the top surface (Fig. 2c). As a result the thicker film shows lower overall conversion ratio slower conversion kinetics and longer half-life time (t 1/2 ) as observed experimentally in Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 4. It is well-known that strain engineering is a general strategy applied in semiconductor materials to enhance device performance3031. Previously the strain-enhanced mobility in organic semiconductors has been achieved by mechanically shearing the growth solution during the crystallization where a substantial mobility improvement is achieved8. In our thin-film device since the top surface contributes to the majority of the photoisomerization while the bottom surface contributes the majority to the electrical conductivity the top surface isomerization can induce uniform lattice strain to the bulk semiconductors (Fig. 2c). Here the molecule configuration deep inside the film is analyzed with grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) conventional X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the electric property is monitored with conductive AFM. Contrary to the high crystallinity on the film surface from the GIXD the film shows low-order diffraction ring (left of Fig. 2f) which indicates more irregular packing inside the bulk phase of the film. Upon UV irradiation GIXD diffraction shifts into distinct Bragg rods (110) and (020) indicating improved packing in xy plane (upper right of Fig. 2f). Interestingly after visible light irradiation this pseudo crystalline phase can be switched back to lower-order phase with weak diffraction and a d-space expansion is observed where (020) peak moves to higher fields with d-value increasing from 2.704 to 2.729 √Ö (lower right of Fig. 2f). It is well known that the strain can induce ordering and crystalline in amorphous materials and the rich dynamics of glass composed of photoisomerization molecules have been discussed recently32. Since this reversible crystallinity change can not be explained by direct photoisomerization of molecules we attribute this effect to the strain-induced crystallization while the details mechanism requires further investigation. From the thin film XRD the d-space shrinking is also observed where the diffraction peaks at 21.05¬∞ shift to higher fields under UV irradiation (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 13) with d-value of the main peak decreasing correspondingly from 4.093 to 4.073 √Ö. The photoisomerization-induced strain can change the carrier mobility and material conductivity similarly to previous mechanical-induced strain33. As shown in Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 8 the conductive AFM scan shows a significant and instant current increase upon UV irradiation and a gradual current decay (K = 0.01587 min‚àí1 ca. 120 min falling with the baseline) at room temperature in the dark which can be attributed to the thermal isomerization of cis to trans in the film and the strain-induced ordering resulting in high carrier mobility253435.

Theoretical calculations

Moreover it is calculated that cis is an unstable conformation excited from trans (Fig. 3a). However compared with those with single conformation the binding energy between cis and trans is much higher (Fig. 3b) resulting in regular molecular arrangement and alignment which also explains that despite the limited concentration of cis especially inside the film it is still able to optimize the molecular packing and further stress on the deeper molecules. In addition the average distance between the trans-trans conformations (3.129 √Ö) in the DFT calculation is larger than that between trans-cis conformations (3.104 √Ö) which indicates light-induced isomerization also synergistically optimizes molecular interaction with dense stacking and ultimately improves device performance (Supplementary Fig. 17). With displacement boundary conditions we simplified the film section and calculated the strain and stress distributions (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 18). It was observed that after UV irradiation both the stress and strain accumulated along the x-axis and eventually released at the film edge. The stress gradually decreases with film depth and ultimately reaches the interface between dielectric and semiconductor affecting the device output through molecular packing optimization. This is in good agreement with the above-proposed mechanism.

Device properties

The photo-switchable OFET devices were then fabricated based on a bottom-gate/top-contact architecture (Fig. 1b) to characterize the electrical properties and mechanical stability. The cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) and element mapping show the homogeneous layered structure of the architecture which is essential to minimize the macroscopic carrier hindrance (Supplementary Fig. 14). Furthermore after the deposition of gold electrodes a new fraction of the sulfur peak appears to the lower-field in the XPS plots (Supplementary Fig. 15) due to the development of a high-strength S-Au bond27 which can reduce the contact barrier between the semiconductor and the electrode. Then the electrical characteristics were examined to quantify the photoisomerization (Fig. 4 Supplementary Figs. 19 and 20). Compared with the negligible photocurrent under UV irradiation (Supplementary Fig. 21) the carrier mobility of annealed device on PET rises from 0.015 ¬± 0.007 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1 (Fig. 4a‚Äìb) to 0.141 ¬± 0.009 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1 (Fig. 4c‚Äìd) with a fixed on/off ratio of 105 showing an increase of 9.4 times on average due to optimized molecular stacking as described previously. In comparison to the device on silicon (Supplementary Fig. 22 and Supplementary Table 6) the flexible device maintains the expected response with moderate performance loss for the rough and bending substrate (Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly the mobility of as-cast film is also improved after UV irradiation which indicates that the strain effect generated by photo-isomerization packs the molecules more regularly similarly to thermal annealing. Furthermore it is found that the device photoresponse increases with UV intensity at the low intensity range (Supplementary Fig. 23). Intense irradiation on the other hand may result in molecular degradation against the device performance. The relationship between incident angle and light response has also been investigated (Supplementary Fig. 24). Due to the varied optical route the device response is observed to be unaffected by the constant radiant intensity on the top surface and the various intensities on the bottom interface. On the other hand front and back irradiation produce different responses to intense (20 mW cm‚àí2 enough light intensity to penetrate the device) and week (100 ŒºW cm‚àí2 not enough intensity to penetrate the device) UV light respectively. Both of these results suggest that the photoisomerization of the top surface has a greater impact on the OFET device‚Äôs photoresponse. To estimate the folding capability a homemade apparatus was designed to realize controllable convex and concave bending (Supplementary Fig. 25). As the PET film is thin the tensile and compressive stress were both small in the bending test and the devices showed negligible performance deterioration during the deformation (Fig. 4e). All the devices showed steady device performance in the deformation test with strain with negligible degradation of the transfer curve (Fig. 4e inset). It is noted that the device also exhibited excellent cyclic performance its mobility and switching ratio stayed constant at 0.015 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1 and 105 after 200 bending cycles respectively (Fig. 4f) and the drain current was reversible under alternant UV and visible light illumination. As shown in Fig. 4g the light-inducing isomerization caused a current change with a stable magnitude of around 10 times (V DS = ‚àí25 V V G = ‚àí25 V). On the other hand heating also leads to cis-trans isomerization. As shown in Fig. 4h and Supplementary Table 5 the rate constant (k) of cis to trans conformation increased by heating producing apparent activation energy of 65.67 kJ mol‚àí1 while the rate constant at 35 ¬∞C (k = 0.07926 min‚àí1) is comparable to that under Vis irradiation. Moreover the device showed better mobility (Supplementary Fig. 26) and slower decay plot (dashed red line in Fig. 4h) at room temperature after UV irradiation at 80 ¬∞C proving the important evidence of steric hindrance in solid-state photoisomerization.

Sensing tests by the OFET array

The as-prepared single OFET device exhibits good performance as described above however to implement true high availability how to make large-scale flexible array is inevitable3637. To realize it we design a strategy by depositing patterned electrodes directly on a desired flexible substrate as shown in Fig. 5a. Specifically patterned AZO-BTBT-8 source electrodes hafnium oxide dielectric layer and drain electrodes were deposited sequentially on an Al 2 O 3 covered ITO-PET. Thus the precise device array layout was obtained (Fig. 5b). Figures 5c and d shows the optical image of a 33 √ó 40 device array the magnified view of the 3 √ó 3 device array and the SEM image of the individual device respectively. The average mobility increased from 0.016 ¬± 0.005 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1 to 0.152 ¬± 0.009 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1 under UV illumination with the on/off ratio of 105 (L = 50 and W = 1080 Œºm) which is consistent with the individual OFET device and demonstrates the reproducibility of the device performance. The optical pattern is obtained after top UV illumination to the array through a smiling cartoon sun garland mask for 20 minutes (Fig. 5e) where the exposed area switched from OFF state (~0.2 ŒºA) to ON state (~2.8 ŒºA) (Fig. 5f). Since the photoisomerization is reversible the image can be erased with visible light irradiation and repatterned. As shown in Fig. 5g h the previous pattern is erased with 30 min exposure of visible light and can be repatterned under the UV illumination with the diaglyph pattern ‚ÄúHi! Chem!‚Äù and a happy emoji. All evidence suggests that the OFET array devices are reversible programable and scalable with promising potential in other fields like flexible sensors displays wearable devices health care and tissue detection.

In this work a functional molecule AZO-BTBT-8 was designed and synthesized by integrating photochromic azobenzene high-performance semiconductor backbone BTBT and flexible alkyl chains. The light-induced self-strain engineering is observed in this material and leads to reversible mobility switching in solid-state devices. Based on this mechanism a large-scale flexible OFET device was fabricated on a flexible substrate using AZO-BTBT-8 molecules as photoisomerization OSCs showing good stability and reproducibility. In conclusion this work establishes a new strategy for designing and developing light-responsive OSCs and corresponding functionalized OFETs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWlsdG9uZXpyYXRpLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvdGhlLWNoaXBzLWJpbGwtc29tZS1mb3Itc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3RvcnMtYWxsLXRvLWVuaGFuY2Utd2FzaGluZ3RvbnMtY29udHJvbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The CHIPS Bill: Some For Semiconductors All To Enhance Washington's Control,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2022/08/21/the-chips-bill-some-for-semiconductors-all-to-enhance-washingtons-control/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWlsdG9uZXpyYXRpLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvdGhlLWNoaXBzLWJpbGwtc29tZS1mb3Itc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3RvcnMtYWxsLXRvLWVuaGFuY2Utd2FzaGluZ3RvbnMtY29udHJvbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkYWhvc3RhdGVzbWFuLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL29wbi1jb2x1bW5zLWJsb2dzL2FydGljbGUyNjQ2ODcwMTQuaHRtbNIBTmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmlkYWhvc3RhdGVzbWFuLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL29wbi1jb2x1bW5zLWJsb2dzL2FydGljbGUyNjQ2ODcwMTQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Idaho‚Äôs lawmakers in D.C. vote against Micron bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.idahostatesman.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Businesses and governments spend billions upon billions each year to protect their assets from cyberattacks. And Statista expects that global market to increase from $183 billion to $539 billion by the end of the decade.

The industry isn't as fragmented as one might think. The top five cybersecurity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) according to The Motley Fool all have CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 1.89%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW -1.20%) as Top 10 holdings and three of the ETFs have both in their top five. And for a good reason as we'll discuss below.

We all know about ransomware and breaches which companies defend against daily but cyberattacks have also become a strategy for some nations. Cyberattacks increased in Ukraine as the Russian invasion began and Taiwan was hit with cyberattacks during U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's recent visit.

Much of our crucial infrastructure defense in the U.S. falls on the private sector. Increasing tensions make cybersecurity companies essential and therefore strong long-term investments.

CrowdStrike is leveraging growth

CrowdStrike is a force in the cybersecurity industry. Its cloud-based solutions powered by artificial intelligence attract major clients including over half of the Fortune 500 and 15 of the top 20 banks in the U.S. Its total customer base is exploding and the growth over the prior four fiscal years is shown below.

CrowdStrike added another 1620 customers in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and now has 17945.

What do we mean by leveraging this growth? CrowdStrike rapidly increases the amount its customers spend with it each period with a dollar-based net retention rate consistently over 120%. For example a customer might sign a contract for CrowdStrike services for one year at $50000. Then the following year it adds more modules and spends $60000.

CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue has increased from $71 million in the first quarter of 208 to over $1.9 billion as of the 2023 first quarter. The company is not yet generating profits on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) but posted $442 million in free cash flow last fiscal year.

CrowdStrike should be near the top of the list for growth-oriented investors.

Palo Alto Networks is an industry leader

Palo Alto Networks is an established leader with the most sales of any independent security company. It has tremendous reach offering network cloud zero-trust and endpoint security and other products and services.

Management is expected to release fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2022 earnings after market close on Monday Aug. 22. Investors should be optimistic since Palo Alto raised its full-year guidance last quarter. It now expects revenue to come in at $5.5 billion for the fiscal year representing a 29% increase year over year.

The earnings report could boost the stock given that the valuation lags behind established competitors like Fortinet as shown below.

Palo Alto posts impressive non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow but is not GAAP profitable due to stock-based compensation (SBC). Management has made it a goal to reduce its SBC as a percentage of revenue. This should be a positive for shareholders.

Both companies are taking advantage of ballooning spending on cyberdefense. The market can be volatile in the short term but long-term investors should do well owning a piece of these innovative companies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15c21hcnRwcmljZS5jb20vZ2Vhci93ZWItc3Rvcmllcy9pbmRpYW4tb3JpZ2luLWNlb3MtbGVhZGluZy1jb21wYW5pZXMv0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXlzbWFydHByaWNlLmNvbS9nZWFyL3dlYi1zdG9yaWVzL2luZGlhbi1vcmlnaW4tY2Vvcy1sZWFkaW5nLWNvbXBhbmllcy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Google to Twitter: Indian Origin CEO's Leading Companies,Arvind Krishna has been at IBM for nearly two decades and is a graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.

PARA,Paramount Global,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LWp1c3QtYm91Z2h0LW1vcmUtb2YtdGhpcy1zdHJlYW1pbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Just Bought More of This Streaming Stock. Should You?,"Buffett's position makes him one of the company's largest shareholders.

Warren Buffett's firm Berkshire Hathaway originally bought 68.9 million shares of Paramount Global (PARA 1.50%) in the first quarter of 2022. During the second quarter the Oracle of Omaha added another 9.5 million shares to bring his total ownership to 78.4 million by the end of the year's first half.

Buffett now owns nearly 13% of the company's Class B shares making him the largest such shareholder. Here's why you should own shares too.

Content is king

In the immortal words of Paramount's founder Sumner Redstone ""content is king."" That may be what Buffett saw when he initially built a position in the company's stock. Paramount's branded networks include Nickelodeon Comedy Central and BET. Perhaps more captivating are Paramount's news and sports franchises which air on cable broadcast and streaming platforms.

One of America's favorite sports is football and Paramount is an NFL staple. The company holds rights to AFC and NFC regular season games playoff games and the Super Bowl on a rotating basis with other networks. Its rights also include college football games from the Southeastern Conference and conference championship games from other power conferences.

The list goes on. Paramount also hosts games from regular season college basketball games and the NCAA's wildly popular annual March Madness tournament. Every year March Madness is followed by another annual sports tradition the Masters PGA golf tournament. Paramount has the rights to that too.

Though football is one of the most popular sports in the U.S. soccer is the international favorite. Paramount's soccer rights feature more than 2000 matches each year from UEFA Champions League Italy's Serie A and the National Women's Soccer League shown on its streaming platform Paramount+.

Paramount's vast content library and sports rights have grown streaming subscribers domestically but its international partnerships could be the next leg of growth in subs. For instance the company has partnered with European cable giant Sky to bundle Paramount+ with its cable offering. During the last quarter Paramount+ launched in the U.K. Ireland and South Korea. In September the streaming platform will launch in Italy and later this year in Germany Austria France and Switzerland. The best part of Paramount's partnership strategy is that each new subscriber comes with zero acquisition cost.

Capitalizing on its international sports momentum Paramount recently won the streaming rights to air Indian Premier League Cricket (IPL) for the next five years. Like soccer in many countries Cricket is easily the favorite sport in India. However there is one big difference -- India is the world's second-most populous country. Previously Disney's Hotstar streaming platform which has 50 million paid subscribers hosted IPL matches. Now Paramount will seek to transition those viewers to Paramount+.

Last quarter management told investors it saw strong acquisitions and engagement on Paramount+ from its new stable of TV shows which includes 1883 and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. On top of that the company's eagerly anticipated theatrical release of Top Gun: Maverick was a smash at the global box office raking in $1.3 billion and supplanting Paramount's own Titanic at No. 7 in all-time domestic box office receipts.

Buffett bought it should you?

Buffett likes to buy downtrodden stocks of companies that he believes can thrive in the long run meaning he likes to buy the dip just as much as anyone else. Paramount stock has certainly dipped collapsing 32% over the last year.

Part of the reason for the stock's underperformance is due to many investors focusing squarely on subscriber growth. In its second quarter Paramount added 5.2 million subscribers to its platforms and removed 3.9 million from Russia for a net gain of 1.7 million. Even before accounting for the Russian removals that number is down from the 6.3 million subs it added in the first quarter.

Other streamers are seeing growth moderate as well. Disney+ subscriber growth slowed in the second quarter and the company lowered its long-term subscriber goal. Netflix actually lost subscribers last quarter and said losses would likely continue this quarter.

Investor concerns also extend to losses generated by the streamers. Paramount's direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment has lost money in the last two quarters since management began reporting it as an independent segment. Management expects peak losses from its DTC segment to occur next year. Disney expects its streaming platforms to be profitable in 2024.

Building out the infrastructure to host streaming platforms requires an enormous amount of capital but Paramount is nearing the finish line. After that ongoing expenditures should diminish considerably.

Picking up where the original show left off the iCarly reboot has all of the fun humor and zany characters as the Nickelodeon version (minus Jennette McCurdy‚Äòs Sam) but the protagonists are all grown-up this time around.

More than a decade has passed since this beloved kids‚Äô TV show went off the air ‚Äî and 10 years have passed in Carly‚Äôs world too. The silly situations these characters face have been updated for an adult audience reflecting changes to the social media landscape in the decade since we last saw Carly and her pals.

In the original iteration of iCarly Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) hosted a web show that streamed on the Internet (also titled ‚ÄúiCarly‚Äù). Now Carly is a social media influencer who‚Äôs navigating the changing landscape of her career and the reality of what it takes to be an adult.

‚ÄúTo be perfectly honest when I was first asked about maybe coming back all the first talks about it started a couple years ago. And I was like ‚ÄòNo we‚Äôre never gonna do that‚Äô‚Äù the School of Rock actress told Variety in June 2022. ‚ÄúAnd I called [my original costars] Jerry [Trainor] and Nathan [Kress] and they were like ‚ÄòNo we shouldn‚Äôt do that.‚Äô And then we just kept talking about it.‚Äù

Cosgrove added: ‚ÄúAnd we came up with the idea that because we‚Äôre adults now and all the people that originally watched the show they were kids that grew up and are adults now like us we were like ‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt we make the show for them?‚Äô They‚Äôre the people that loved the show originally and they‚Äôre really who this is for. So that really gave us a lot of direction after we realized that we were all on board and wanted to do that. And it started to get really fun after that.‚Äù

The first season of the new iCarly debuted on Paramount+ in June 2021 with a 13-episode order. A second season was later greenlit returning in 2022 with 10 new episodes.

‚ÄúI was proud when I started producing the iCarly reboot and people started listening to my ideas‚Äù Cosgrove exclusively gushed to Us Weekly in March 2022 referring to her role as a producer on the revival. ‚ÄúI love being able to help write the comedy on the iCarly reboot.‚Äù

Paramount+ eventually announced the sitcom‚Äôs third season in July 2022 alongside a vague 2023 release date.

The media rights agreements will begin July 1 2023 and run through the 2029-30 season.

‚ÄúThe Big Ten Conference media rights agreements are more than just dollars and deals. They are a mechanism to provide stability and maximum exposure for our student-athletes member institutions and partners during these uncertain times in collegiate athletics‚Äù Big Ten Conference Commissioner Kevin Warren said. ‚ÄúWe are very grateful to our world-class media partners for recognizing the strength of the Big Ten Conference brand and providing the incredible resources we need for our student-athletes to compete at the very highest levels and to achieve their academic and athletics goals.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Big Ten has been a valued partner for more than three decades and we are thrilled to expand that relationship by adding Big Ten football to our portfolio of marquee properties‚Äù said Sean McManus Chairman CBS Sports. ‚ÄúThe combination of CBS Sports‚Äô proven record in elevating college conferences to new heights our standard of excellence and the strength and reach of Paramount Global‚Äôs linear and digital platforms will create a powerful showcase for the Big Ten and its student-athletes. Together with Kevin Warren and the team at the Big Ten we look forward to growing the conference to the highest of levels reaching the widest audience.‚Äù

In an ever-evolving landscape the Big Ten remains the most storied collegiate athletic conference in the country.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are incredibly excited to be partnering with Kevin Warren and the Big Ten Conference on this robust package of sports‚Äù said Pete Bevacqua Chairman NBC Sports. ‚ÄúWith Big Ten Saturday Night and Sunday Night Football headlining each fall weekend in primetime on NBC and Peacock along with our historic Notre Dame Football partnership NBC Sports will be the home of premier games in college football and the NFL. In addition with the rights to a wide range of Big Ten events Peacock and NBC Sports will be a year-round destination for the best in college sports.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe new rights agreements are an incredible achievement for our entire conference and a true testament of what can be accomplished with teamwork‚Äù stated Commissioner Warren. ‚ÄúI am incredibly grateful for collaborative efforts and hard work of our conference staff specifically Laura Anderson Anil Gollahalli Kerry Kenny and Adam Neuman our presidents and chancellors athletics directors coaches student-athletes and our partners at CBS NBC and FOX Sports for solidifying unprecedented Big Ten access across transformative media companies for our fans to tune-in and follow the Big Ten content they love.‚Äù

The Big Ten Conference new media agreements grant the following rights to their partners:

BTN will maintain its strong position as the home for Big Ten fans as the network will continue to televise a full slate of football basketball and Olympic sport competition throughout the entire year.

CBS‚Äôs initial season in 2023 will include seven football games and both regular season and postseason men‚Äôs basketball action along with the Big Ten Women‚Äôs Basketball Tournament final appearing on CBS for the first time. The Big Ten Men‚Äôs Basketball Tournament semifinals and final will continue the tradition of airing on CBS which they have done for 25 years. Every CBS Big Ten football and basketball broadcast will also be streamed on Paramount+ Paramount Global‚Äôs direct-to-consumer streaming service.

Starting in 2024 CBS will televise up to 15 regular-season football games per season including an annual Black Friday game in the afternoon. CBS is America‚Äôs most-watched network for the past 14 years and the highest-rated college football network.

FOX has renewed its agreement to televise football and men‚Äôs basketball games each season with the opportunity to carry additional sports throughout the year. The Big Ten Conference‚Äôs partnership with FOX reached its high point during the 2021-22 year as FOX captured the #1 time slot in college football for the first time with its Big Noon Saturday platform that featured 10-14 games involving a Big Ten team and a men‚Äôs basketball season that ended with the top three most watched games in the history of FS1 all featuring Big Ten programs.

NBC will produce 14-to-16 games on broadcast television each season as it introduces college football fans to Big Ten Saturday Night. Each Big Ten game on NBC broadcast will also be simul-streamed on Peacock NBCUniversal‚Äôs direct-to-consumer streaming service. NBC Sports has established the most dominant primetime franchise in television history as its Sunday Night Football has been primetime‚Äôs No. 1 show for an unprecedented 11 consecutive years ‚Äì a streak that is currently active.

Peacock NBCUniversal‚Äôs direct-to-consumer streaming service will deliver exclusive Big Ten football and basketball games each season as eight regular-season football games will appear on the platform along with as many as 47 regular-season men‚Äôs basketball games (32 conference and 15 non-conference) and 30 regular-season women‚Äôs basketball games (20 conference and 10 non-conference).

The band played at the Paycom Center in Oklahoma City to begin a 25-date tour that takes them through until early October.

At the show they performed the track ‚ÄòBury Me In Black‚Äô for the first time in 19 years as the second song in the set before going on to play ‚ÄòThis Is the Best Day Ever‚Äò for the first time since 2005.

Elsewhere they dedicated ‚ÄòThe Ghost Of You‚Äô to Doug McKean the producer who died aged 54 last month with his most recent work on the band‚Äôs comeback single ‚ÄòThe Foundations Of Decay‚Äô. Upon his death MCR led tributes writing: ‚ÄúMy Chemical Romance lost Doug McKean a dear friend a collaborator a partner a brother a problem-solver a genius an integral part of our music. Doug was someone who made us laugh made us better understood and always came to the rescue. He is deeply missed. He always will be.‚Å£‚Äù

Elsewhere at the Oklahoma City show the band played hits ‚ÄòTeenagers‚Äô ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Not Okay (I Promise)‚Äô and many more across a 22-song set.

Across their reunion dates so far the band have played a mix of hits fan favourites and deep cuts also performing two songs for the first time ever.

My Chemical Romance kicked off their run of live dates in mid-May at the Eden Project in Cornwall marking their first UK show in 11 years.

In a five-star review NME said: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre now safely one of the biggest rock groups to emerge in the last 20 years but if the band are worried about their new found status they don‚Äôt show it.

The fizzing static distortions in the intro to ‚ÄúThe Foundations of Decay‚Äù the surprise single released this May in support of the reunion tour practically serve as white noise behind the jubilant roars of the crowd as the band takes the stage inside Oklahoma City‚Äôs Paycom Arena. (Grab tickets to the rest of MCR‚Äôs tour dates here.)

Clocking in at an epic six minutes ‚ÄúThe Foundations of Decay‚Äù features a bite-sized version of the same world-building story-craft often associated with the My Chemical Romance albums. Way‚Äôs soft-spoken early verse conjures the image of an old and battered general atop a hill reflecting both on wounds both physical and emotional. The parallels between the protagonist and Way himself are clear and longtime MCR fans know exactly how the singer got these scars.

Way‚Äôs words carry a personal connotation but it is a sentiment that likely resonates with many gathered tonight. In the past few decades the band‚Äôs core age demographic has lived through 9/11 recession multiple wars a global pandemic and the ever-growing sense that society‚Äôs status quo could disintegrate at any moment ‚Äî goldilocks conditions for the nihilist origin stories of a generation. So as the band transitions into the song‚Äôs howling crescendo and a giant red curtain falls behind them to reveal a dystopian backdrop of crumbling city towers looming ragged over the fuming debris at ground zero the stage is finally set. Here we are at the cusp of oblivion. What happens now?

If the world is in its decay era Way and MCR appear less interested in saving it and are instead content to go out laughing crying raging. MCR transition form their newest song into ‚ÄúBury Me in Black‚Äù and the adrenaline-kicker ‚ÄúGive ‚ÄòEm Hell Kid‚Äù aided by impressively precise percussion from new drummer Jarrod Alexander who‚Äôs performing with the phrase ‚ÄúBIG DEATH ENERGY‚Äù scrawled in red across the front of the kick drum.

One of the most endearing aspects of MCR is their catalog rich with catchy choruses and melodies just begging for a singalong and the band tosses an eager crowd its first bone with ‚ÄúTeenagers.‚Äù Lead guitarist and backing vocalist Ray Toro can‚Äôt help but smile as he eggs the fans on. Though the European leg of the reunion tour preceded the American dates there is nothing like a home crowd; hearing a near-capacity audience recite a song‚Äôs every word back to the band is not a new experience for MCR but this is the first time since the pandemic the members have heard it from an American audience. Aside from a few one-off reunion shows it‚Äôs also their first full tour since 2012. Nostalgia‚Äôs comforting embrace hugs the entire room.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlbGNvbWV0b2xvdWRjaXR5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzgvMjEvMjMzMTYwMzIvb2tjLXRodW5kZXItd2h5LWEtbmV3LWFyZW5hLWlzLXZpdGFsLWZvci10aGUtdGh1bmRlci1hbmQtZG93bnRvd27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OKC Thunder: Why a new arena is vital for the Thunder and downtown,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.welcometoloudcity.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/8/21/23316032/okc-thunder-why-a-new-arena-is-vital-for-the-thunder-and-downtown (Caused by SSLError(CertificateError(""hostname 'www.welcometoloudcity.com' doesn't match either of '*.eater.com', '*.meridian.net', '*.recode.net', '*.voxcreative.com', '*.voxfieldguide.com', '*.voxops.net', 'cdn.cstatic.net', 'curbed.com', 'eater.com', 'meridian.net', 'polygon.com', 'racked.com', 'recode.net', 'sbnation.com', 'vox-cdn.com', 'vox.com', 'voxcreative.com', 'voxfieldguide.com', 'voxops.net', '*.theverge.com', '*.voxmedia.com', 'theverge.com', 'voxmedia.com', '*.polygon.com', '*.racked.com', '*.sbnation.com', '*.vox-cdn.com', '*.vox.com'""))) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlbGNvbWV0b2xvdWRjaXR5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzgvMjEvMjMzMTYwMzIvb2tjLXRodW5kZXItd2h5LWEtbmV3LWFyZW5hLWlzLXZpdGFsLWZvci10aGUtdGh1bmRlci1hbmQtZG93bnRvd27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vbXVzaWMvbXVzaWMtbmV3cy9teS1jaGVtaWNhbC1yb21hbmNlLWJ1cnktbWUtaW4tYmxhY2stbGl2ZS0xMjM0NTc5MDA1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch My Chemical Romance Play 'Bury Me in Black' For First Time in 19 Years,"My Chemical Romance pulled out two rarities during a show at the Paycom Center in Oklahoma City this weekend as they kicked off their North American reunion tour.

The 22-song set marked the first time the group had performed either track live in over 15 years. Elsewhere during the show My Chemical Romance played hits like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Not Okay (I Promise)‚Äù and ‚ÄúTeenagers.‚Äù

My Chemical Romance launched their reunion tour earlier this year at the Eden Project in Cornwall England. Prior to the tour the band released a new single ‚ÄúThe Foundations of Decay.‚Äù The sprawling six-minute epic that blends to-the-rafters emo rock with clever twists and turns into hardcore and prog that marked My Chemical Romance‚Äôs first new music in eight years.

After disbanding in 2013 the group announced their return in fall 2019 and played a single show that December but the first wave of Covid-19 forced them to put their touring plans on hold.

It is a celebration of the new NFL season so treat it like one. Acknowledge last year‚Äôs champion with an awards ceremony. Give them an engraved trophy. Print up T-shirts with their team logo. Announce new team names. Vote on league rule changes. Present last season‚Äôs worst team with ‚ÄúThe Hammer Award‚Äù an actual hammer nailed to a piece of wood. Celebrate good times come on.

WEAR APPROPRIATE ATTIRE

I‚Äôm not talking a jacket and tie. This is an NFL fantasy draft so wear NFL gear. If you have a Josh Allen jersey wear it. If you have a foam cheese head wear it. If you‚Äôre coming to the draft straight from work grab your new Commanders hat and wear it.

FUEL UP

Expert drafting requires healthy brain function. How you fuel that brain is up to you. My son Billy brings a whole Jersey Mikes No. 6 (roast beef and provolone) to his draft washed down with a bottle of ice-cold root beer. He is a cognitive wizard after a meal like that drafting a playoff team two years in a row.

BRING CHEAT SHEETS

Go to FantasyGuru.com and download our NFL Season Fantasy Football Rankings. Adjustable to PPR or Non-PPR the list can be adjusted by tiers positions teams byes and even consensus ADP. You won‚Äôt find a more accurate or user-friendly program on the web.

THE WRITE STUFF

What did the forgetful skydiver say when he jumped out of the plane? ‚ÄúAw chute!‚Äù Don‚Äôt be that guy. Remember to bring a pen. On second thought bring TWO pens.

Bars can be too expensive and distracting for optimal fantasy drafting.

BASEMENTS ARE BEST

I‚Äôve been to drafts in loud bars which gets expensive and distracting. I‚Äôve been to drafts in backyards swatting away gnats and mosquitos. I‚Äôve been to drafts on decks where the lighting is so poor I used my phone flashlight to see my cheat sheets. Give me a damp well-lit basement a TV tray table and a big draft board duct taped to cement block next to a glossy white refrigerator from 1956. Now that‚Äôs what I call a Fantasy Football Draft.

TWO-MINUTE DRILL

Your draft should be lively not a cure for insomnia. Some leagues allow five minutes per draft pick. At that rate a twelve-team league would pick for 15 hours. Make your draft short and sweet. Everyone has had six months to decide who they want to draft. Two minutes is plenty of time.

LIVE AND IN PERSON

Attending a draft with your fellow league members is always great fun. The friendly face-to-face banter of competing franchises makes memories that last a lifetime. I can still remember the night the rookie owner of the AC Heartbreakers drafted Vincent Alexander a replacement player from the 1987 strike season who was out of football. After haranguing him for ten minutes we took no mercy and made him keep the pick.

AVOID TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES

For better or worse leagues are no longer a group of local friends from work or the neighborhood. My leagues have owners from New Jersey to Maryland to Chicago. Whether you use Zoom Google Meet or live drafting on your league website all require a computer connection. Make sure yours is set and ready. Nobody likes waiting for Herschel from L.A. trying to get his WiFi going after the draft started.

DO NOT USE PAYPAL OR VENMO

This is not an urban myth. Matthew Berry even tweeted this out last year. Using PayPal or Venmo for Fantasy leagues is against their company terms of service. They can freeze your account and sometimes take your funds if you get caught. Cash is king.

CURE FOR THE QUARANTINED

COVID is still a menace. No one knows how it will roar back this fall. Adding two roster spots or allowing COVID infected players to be placed on IR until healthy will curtail lineup shortages on game day.

DON‚ÄôT BRING YOUR BABY

My twin brother Clark brought his infant son to a draft years ago. The kid shrieked non-stop for 16 rounds. Clark had a baby bottle in one hand and a beer bottle in the other. The distracted annoyed league owners suffered through what should have been the best four hours of the NFL season. I‚Äôm pretty sure Clark won the league that year. Devious right?

A SUCKER IS BORN EVERY MINUTE

When a fellow owner asks my opinion at the draft do what I do; LIE TO THEIR FACE. ‚ÄúWhat do I think of Joe Burrow in the next round? Are you crazy? I would be all over Peyton Manning with your next pick. I know he‚Äôs retired but I just read on this new hot Fantasy blog that Manning is signing with Seattle for his big comeback. Then in the next round be sure to grab Geno Smith. He will be Manning‚Äôs backup.‚Äù

HOOKED ON STEPHONICS

You did 1000 mock drafts during the summer. Every time Stephon Diggs was available in the second round. But on draft day another owner snags him just before you pick. Don‚Äôt panic. Don‚Äôt throw your cheat sheets across the room. Move on to your next choice. Plus you should have known better ‚Äî the owner who took Diggs calls his team Stephon the Gas.

RULES ARE NOT MEANT TO BE BROKEN

No adjustments to any league rules should be allowed after the draft starts. You can‚Äôt make stuff up as you go along. If issues arise table them for next year.

The comedy actor who is one of the part owners of the Los Angeles football team made the trip up the west coast to cheer on the side in their California derby clash against San Jose Earthquakes.

LAFC had recorded seven straight wins with a 1-0 victory on Tuesday evening against DC United managed by Wayne Rooney.

They are currently flying high at the the top of the MLS Western Conference ‚Äì and depending on results in the latest round of matches this weekend would confirm a playoff place with eight games of the regular season still to play.

Their Welsh star Gareth Bale had missed the team‚Äôs last two fixtures but was named on the bench for the game against San Jose.

Ahead of kick off the players were visited by Anchorman star Ferrell in their changing room.

Last week it was revealed that the comic had sent the Wales captain a personal message to help persuade him to sign for the club ‚Äì and the pair were pictured sharing a joke at San Jose‚Äôs Paypal Park Stadium.

Ferrell who is a huge fan of football  was pictured back in May alongside David Beckham Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney at Wembley for the FA Trophy final between Wrexham and Bromley.

This time he shunned any VIP seating to support his side alongside the large and vociferous LAFC fans in the away section at PayPal Park.

Sadly it was a night of both lows and highs for both the Hollywood star and the club‚Äôs Welsh icon.

While Bale looked sharp in a 15 minute cameo from the bench he unfortunately couldn‚Äôt help his new club avoid defeat against the San Jose Earthquakes losing 2-1.

Despite the final scoreline however there was some good news. Because results elsewhere had gone their way the club had secured a playoff place.

That playoff place was clinched after 25 games equalling the club‚Äôs 2019 squad which achieved the same feat.

25 Matches. Playoffs clinched. This ties us with our Historic 2019 squad for the fewest matches needed to clinch an @MLS Playoff spot. x ‚Äì #LAFC pic.twitter.com/RLHRQtppFw ‚Äî LAFC (@LAFC) August 21 2022

Additional FAQs

1. Will I be able to see my prepaid card balance through the above methods?

You can attach your credit and debit cards to your PayPal account and seamlessly use them for online purchases and pay directly through PayPal. However PayPal does not have access to your balance ‚Äì the company merely secures the transaction if it is possible. So it is impossible to access your card or bank account balance via PayPal.

2. Can I use someone else‚Äôs credit card on PayPal?

Yes you can. PayPal does not monitor the ownership of the card. They do not check the name against the person requesting to use the account. As long as you can verify the card and finish the attachment process successfully you will be able to use the card on the account. This can simplify things as you can make various payment combinations work.

3. Can I use someone else‚Äôs bank account for PayPal?

While PayPal allows credit cards to be used by various people the service won‚Äôt allow you to link a bank account registered to someone else to your PayPal account. Various related legal issues are why bank accounts are scrutinized more than credit/debit cards.

4. What is a PayPal business account?

There are two main PayPal account types: personal and business. The personal account is the most common one. Business accounts however are more detailed but they also make business transactions much faster. Credit card payments are processed quicker. With the business account your customers do not have to own PayPal accounts to pay you. They can do it via credit cards debit cards Venmo PayPal credit or PayPal itself.

5. Can I create multiple PayPal accounts?

Of course you can provided you use a different email address that is. Since payment requests and sending are handled via email addresses having two PayPal accounts with the same email address is not possible. Even if you want to create a personal and a business account you cannot do it on the same email address. So while you can have as many PayPal accounts as you want you need to use different credentials.

Your PayPal Experience

Checking your PayPal balance is probably the easiest thing to do on PayPal. It works pretty much the same across all devices. As long as you enter your credentials and log in you will be able to see your balance immediately.

Over the weekend fans of MTN DEW Pitch Black noticed a new listing on the official PepsiCo beverage facts website. According to that listing MTN DEW Pitch Black is being revived as an exclusive flavor to Speedway stores.

In addition to regular MTN DEW Pitch Black the listing also teases a Zero Sugar alternative available through the chain's fountain machines.

Should the MTN DEW brand in fact bring back Pitch Black it'd be the first time since 2005 the drink has been widely available in the United States. Despite a continue presence in Singapore and Malaysia Pitch Black was first introduced in 2004 before the flavor profile was altered in 2006. It was then available in very few markets stateside between 2011 and 2019 before being discontinued across the board in 2020.

It should be noted that previous flavors have also appeared on the website only to fizzle out at some point throughout the development process so there's no guarantee the flavor will be revived.

If Speedway managed to land the Pitch Black exclusive it wouldn't be the first DEW flavor it landed. MTN DEW Spark was the convenience store chains' first exclusive a few years back and was so popular the brand added the flavor to its permanent lineup nationwide.

""Each time we released MTN DEW SPARK DEW Nation's enthusiasm was off the charts. Some people traveled significant distances just to get a taste"" DEW marketing VIP Pat O'Toole offered in a press release at the time. ""Now fans everywhere can get a taste of MTN DEW SPARK. We are pleased to bring it to shelves nationwide and also introduce a brand new zero sugar beverage with the same bold flavor.""

The above listing only portrays a fountain alternative for both drinks. If Pitch Black were to follow in-line with Spark however the drinks would also be available in 20-ounce bottles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXdzY291cmllci5jb20vbmV3cy9jbzItc2hvcnRhZ2UtYmVoaW5kLXN1bmRyb3AtZGlzYXBwZWFyYW5jZS9hcnRpY2xlXzZkNmI5ODk4LTFmZmItMTFlZC1iZDc2LTgzNmMzYzMyOTk5NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CO2 shortage behind SunDrop disappearance | News | enewscourier.com,"Athens AL (35611)

Pfizer has been in Rockland since acquiring Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in 2009 along with the buildings and acreage owned by Wyeth. In 2015 Pfizer sold 207 acres and 25 buildings at 401 N. Middletown Road in Pearl River that it wasn‚Äù‚Ñ¢t going to continue using to Industrial Realty Group LLC (IRG) which now operates the property as Hudson Valley iCampus. Pfizer continues to own 33 acres and occupies about 850000 square feet of building space on its Pearl River campus.

Jerica Pitts Pfizer‚Äù‚Ñ¢s senior director of global media relations for Pfizer told the Business Journals ‚ÄúPfizer has new plans for a $470 million transformational investment for its Vaccine Research and Development campus in Pearl River. Over the next three years subject to approvals from officials and other entities as required Pfizer plans to expand and modernize our campus with a new 260000-square-foot lab building for 370 colleagues and amenities such as a modern caf√É¬© fitness center parking garage and functional outdoor plaza. The rejuvenated campus will feature connected buildings and a prominent main entrance.‚Äù¬ù

‚ÄúIt‚Äù‚Ñ¢s heartening to see the renaissance this company has undergone during my administration‚Äù¬ù Rockland County Executive Ed Day told the Business Journals. ‚ÄúI‚Äù‚Ñ¢m happy to see these champions against a global health crisis planning to invest and create even deeper roots within our beautiful county with a $470 million expansion and 100 new hires. I commend Pfizer on its contribution to science and saving lives along with its commitment to calling Rockland home.‚Äù¬ù

On July 24 Day had gone to Pfizer for a ceremony awarding keys to the county to two of the company‚Äù‚Ñ¢s employees in view of Pfizer‚Äù‚Ñ¢s development of a Covid-19 vaccine. Kathrin U. Jansen senior vice president and head of vaccine research and development along with her colleague Steve Bjornson who is vice president and COO of vaccine research and development each received a Key to the County Award for their commitment to science and saving lives.

The expansion is expected to result in Pfizer hiring additional employees. It already employs approximately 1000 at the Pearl River site. It‚Äù‚Ñ¢s believed Pfizer wants to break ground by 2024 and complete the expansion in 2026.

‚ÄúI think all-around it‚Äù‚Ñ¢s a win-win‚Äù¬ù Orangetown Town Supervisor Teresa Kenny told the Business Journals. ‚ÄúThey are making a commitment to staying here. There are over 1000 employees onsite. They always had a lot of employees there but at one point they were down and there was a lot of concern that they were going to sell and leave so it‚Äù‚Ñ¢s a commitment to being here long term.‚Äù¬ù

Kenny said that although as of Aug. 5 site plans had not yet been submitted to begin the review process by the Orangetown Planning Board Zoning Board and Building Department the expansion concept was described to her and ‚Äúit will be a complement to the town.‚Äù¬ù

Kenny expressed a hope that Pfizer‚Äù‚Ñ¢s expansion and commitment to Orangetown would attract other bioscience businesses to the area.

Kenny said that she and the town attorney and head of the building department have met informally with Pfizer. Additional informal meetings were expected to take place in the coming weeks.

‚ÄúThey are very anxious apparently to move fast on this‚Äù¬ù Kenny said. ‚ÄúA lot of how fast they move is in their control. The process itself can take a while but if you listen to the Pfizer representatives they want it done really fast. We‚Äù‚Ñ¢ll do our best to work with them.‚Äù¬ù

Kenny said that she lives about a mile from Pfizer in Pearl River and the company has been a good neighbor in the community.

‚ÄúWhen I came into office they reached out to me immediately and I went on a tour of their facility pre-Covid. They really wanted to be part of the community‚Äù¬ù Kenny said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù‚Ñ¢re a good corporate neighbor and I‚Äù‚Ñ¢m glad they‚Äù‚Ñ¢re going to be here for a long time.‚Äù¬ù

Pfizer says that its Rockland facility is one of its nine major research and development sites.

IRG has been attracting new tenants to its campus and did not yet know whether Pfizer would be leasing space for the expansion or confining any new buildings to the property it already owns. Among the tenants at iCampus are Sanofi US Services Inc. Iris Biogen Corp. Party City and Urban Electric Power Inc.

Jamie Schwarz president of Hudson Valley iCampus told the Business Journals that Momentive Performance Materials has signed a lease for about 67000 square feet of space and is getting it ready for January occupancy.

‚ÄúWe have a bunch of deals in the pipeline so from a leasing perceptive we‚Äù‚Ñ¢re pretty happy‚Äù¬ù Schwartz said. ‚ÄúThe existing infrastructure in some of the buildings already has the elements that a life-sciences or biomed company needs. There are all kinds of technical requirements although they might need to be updated. That infrastructure would cost somebody a lot of money to build from scratch so we‚Äù‚Ñ¢re getting a lot of interest from companies in those fields.‚Äù¬ù

Schwartz said that Pfizer making a commitment to stay in Pearl River and enhance its presence is a huge vote of confidence and sends a signal to others.

‚ÄúThey already had a vaccine operation here but I think they also are happy with how things are going on the campus‚Äù¬ù Schwartz said. ‚ÄúFrom a leasing perspective I don‚Äù‚Ñ¢t think they‚Äù‚Ñ¢d make that commitment unless they were happy. They do also rent space from us.‚Äù¬ù

He said that the whole Hudson Valley region benefits from Pfizer‚Äù‚Ñ¢s planned expansion in Rockland as well as benefitting from the new facilities being constructed in Westchester County by Tarrytown-based Regeneron which broke ground a few weeks ago for a $1.8 billion expansion.

‚ÄúIt‚Äù‚Ñ¢s nothing but good news‚Äù¬ù Schwartz said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZW4ubWVyY29wcmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMC9wZml6ZXItZmlsZXMtZm9yLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1jbGVhcmFuY2Utb2YtYml2YWxlbnQtYy0xOS12YXgtaW4tYnJhemls0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer files for emergency clearance of bivalent C-19 vax in Brazil,"Pfizer files for emergency clearance of bivalent C-19 vax in Brazil

20th Saturday August 2022 - 09:54 UTC Full article

Pfizer's ComiRNAty vaccine has been applied in Brazil since February 2021 but the new one would also target the Omicron variant

Brazil's National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) has received a request for the emergency use of Pfizer's newest vaccine against COVID-19 which would be active against both the original and the √îmicron strain subvariant BA.1.

Pfizer's ComiRNAty vaccine has been applied in Brazil since February 2021.



Once the request for emergency use authorization is received Anvisa has 30 days to complete the evaluation. This period is interrupted whenever it is necessary to ask the company for complementary information or clarification on the quality efficacy and safety data presented.

The UK was the first country to approve a vaccine designed to combat Omicron. The bivalent vaccine manufactured by US laboratory Moderna was confirmed for approval this week.

The decision by the British regulatory body equivalent to Anvisa was based on clinical trials that showed a ¬ìstrong immune response¬î against Omicron triggered by the immunizer.

Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine with a new formula will be used in the UK primarily as a booster for people aged 50 and over starting in the fall.

The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (the British equivalent to Anvisa) said the updated Moderna drug protects users against the initial version of SARS-CoV-2 as well as from the more contagious Omicron lineage. It also pointed out the new chemical met British standards of safety quality and effectiveness. The agency said it based its decision on trials that showed a ‚Äúgood immune response‚Äù against Omicron sub-variants BA.4 and BA.5. (Source: Agencia Brasil)

Biden first tested positive on Tuesday and her office said at the time that she was suffering only mild symptoms. She contracted the virus during a South Carolina vacation with her family including President Joe Biden.

""After isolating for five days and receiving negative results from two consecutive COVID-19 tests the First Lady will depart South Carolina later today for Delaware"" Biden's communications director Elizabeth Alexander said in a statement.

The First Lady kept up working during her isolation holding zoom calls in preparation for a semester of teaching at Northern Virginia Community College.

DEFENSE SECRETARY LLOYD AUSTIN TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS FOR A SECOND TIME

Biden treated the virus with Paxlovid and experienced ""cold-like"" symptoms according to the White House.

Her infection came weeks after President Biden contracted the virus twice in late July. White House Physician Kevin O'Connor said the president suffered moderate symptoms. He had a rebound case days after testing negative for the virus however but reportedly experienced no symptoms in that instance. Biden nevertheless self-isolated until August 7.

The Biden family spent last week at a private residence on Kiawah Island a wealthy and secluded vacation spot.

The president's son Hunter Biden accompanied the first couple on Air Force One for the flight from Washington last week. Biden's daughter-in-law Melissa Cohen and grandson Beau also attended.

Late-summer vacations are common for U.S. presidents. Former Presidents George W. Bush Barack Obama and Donald Trump all took similar vacations throughout their time in office. Bush would often spend the time at his Texas ranch while Obama and Trump both preferred golf resorts in New England.

Earlier this week British regulators became the first in the world to authorize Moderna‚Äôs bivalent vaccine which protects against both the original strain of the novel coronavirus and the Omicron BA.1 subvariant.

Health Canada is currently reviewing bivalent booster candidates from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech which leaves some Canadians debating whether to wait for the revamped shots or go for a booster now.

With viral circulation projected to pick up as the season changes some provinces are encouraging people to get a booster of the approved version of the vaccine. For many people that would mean a fourth or fifth dose of the original formula.

Experts say the extent to which the bivalent vaccines provide additional protection from catching COVID-19 is still being studied and the cost-benefit analysis of waiting for one depends on the person.

Here‚Äôs a look at what we know about the bivalent vaccines and how they could factor into a fall wave.

WHEN WILL BIVALENT VACCINES BE AVAILABLE?

Health Canada received Moderna‚Äôs bivalent vaccine application on June 30 while its British counterpart got the paperwork to start its review earlier that month spokesman Mark Johnson said in an email. Pfizer filed a submission for its updated shot on July 25.

While the agency didn‚Äôt provide a timeline on when these reviews are set to wrap up Health Canada has already asked vaccine manufacturers to further tweak their bivalent vaccines to target the fast-spreading Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants ‚Äúas soon as possible‚Äù Johnson said.

Canada‚Äôs chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says Canada has secured a ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù supply of bivalent vaccines if regulators greenlight a rollout.

Infectious disease specialist Dr. Zain Chagla said he expects to see more countries authorize bivalent vaccines in the coming weeks and months which should give Canada time to integrate the updated shots into its fall immunization campaign.

HOW DO BIVALENT BOOSTERS COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL VACCINES?

Currently available COVID-19 vaccines are monovalent ‚Äì tailored solely to the original novel coronavirus. In addition to defending against this earlier strain the proposed bivalent vaccines were designed to recognize specific mutations in Omicron‚Äôs spike protein that make it better at evading immune detection.

These updated vaccines may provide ‚Äúincremental‚Äù added protection against catching Omicron but the extent remains to be seen said Tam.

Chagla an associate professor at Hamilton‚Äôs McMaster University said bivalent vaccines may not be the gamechanger that some have hoped for in curbing the spread of the virus.

As the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants gain steam in much of the country the BA.1-tailored bivalent vaccines might not be that much better than a first-generation booster when it comes to deterring COVID-19 infection Chagla said.

Emerging research suggests that the protection provided by currently available boosters wanes within six to eight weeks said Chagla. He expects that bivalent vaccines could extend this period by a few additional weeks _ not months.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to be proven wrong‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt know if this is going to reset the clock.‚Äù

Both the old and new versions of the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes he noted.

SHOULD I WAIT TO GET A BIVALENT VACCINE?

The short answer is: it depends.

Provinces have expanded access to fourth ‚Äì and in Quebec fifth ‚Äì doses of the original COVID-19 vaccine with the expectation that COVID-19 cases will spike as temperatures fall.

With the health-care system already stretched to its limits the priority needs to be boosting those at highest risk of landing in hospital such as immunocompromised people and older adults Chagla said.

But as a greater share of the population has gained hybrid immunity it wouldn‚Äôt be unreasonable for low-risk people to wait for the latest version of the vaccine Chagla said.

Tam encouraged Canadians to weigh both their personal risks and level of COVID-19 spread in their community. But if it‚Äôs been more than six months since your last infection or vaccination you may want to roll up your sleeves for another shot before the cold weather sets in she said.

‚ÄúIf you waited too long the wave could be starting‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThen you don‚Äôt derive as much benefit.‚Äù

PLAYING THE CATCH-UP GAME

A key challenge in COVID-19 control is that the evolution of the virus has far outpaced the time it takes to develop test manufacture review and roll out a vaccine that can counteract the latest mutation.

‚ÄúBy the time the wave occurs ‚Äì two to three months ‚Äì that‚Äôs barely enough to scratch the surface of getting a new vaccine‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is this catch-up game that‚Äôs occurring all the time.‚Äù

He hopes the inaugural rollout of bivalent vaccines could provide a ‚Äúproof-of-concept‚Äù that will fast-track this process for future iterations of the vaccine similar to how the flu shot is tweaked every fall to target variants that are circulating.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with this being a flu-season-like model where people just get updated for a certain amount of time‚Äù he said.

While we can‚Äôt expect perfect protection from getting sick we can have the tools to prevent severe illness among the most vulnerable.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre lucky to have this technology.‚Äù"

San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama is reportedly ""intrigued"" by the idea of playing with Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young.

""I will say I have talked to people who know Wemby who have indicated he is at least intrigued by the idea"" ESPN's Tim MacMahon said on the Hoop Collective (39:13 mark). ""Now intrigued by that idea and pounding the table are two very different things. I have no idea whether Gregg Popovich would be intrigued by the idea.""

San Antonio has been regularly mentioned as a potential suitor should the Hawks choose to trade Young who seems to have plateaued as the 1A option in Atlanta. Young averaged 25.7 points and 10.8 assists per game this season‚Äîhis second straight 25-10 campaign‚Äîbut the Hawks failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 2020.

The calculus may have changed in both Atlanta and San Antonio on Sunday with both teams coming away lottery winners. The Spurs will have picks Nos. 4 and 8 in the lottery after the Toronto Raptors' first-round pick was conveyed while the Hawks shocked the world to win the lottery.

Both teams face intriguing decisions on how to handle the draft over the next month. ESPN's Zach Lowe noted Atlanta faces a crossroads of sorts as it explores whether to trade the No. 1 pick for a veteran and continue building around Young and Dejounte Murray or make the pick and continue exploring their trade options with the two guards.

The Spurs are armed with cap space and a generational building block in Wembanyama who finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting and won Rookie of the Year in 2023-24. It's possible they could look to kickstart their rebuild by floating one of those picks for a veteran who fits within Wembanyama's timeline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9uMy5jb20vbmV3cy80LXN0YXItcGcta2luZy1ncmFjZS11cGRhdGVzLXJlY3J1aXRtZW50LXRhbGtzLWxzdS1taXNzaXNzaXBwaS1zdGF0ZS1zbXUtYW5kLXRjdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4-star PG King Grace updates recruitment talks LSU Mississippi State SMU and TCU,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL29seW1waWNzLmNvbS9pb2MvbmV3cy9wLWctdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1vbHltcGljLXZpbGxhZ2UtbnVyc2VyeS1hcy1wYXJ0LW9mLWl0cy13aWRlc3QtZXZlci1yYW5nZS1vZi1nYW1lcy10aW1lLXNlcnZpY2VzLWZvci1hdGhsZXRlcy1kdXJpbmctcGFyaXMtMjAyNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P&G to support Olympic Village nursery as part of its widest ever range of Games-time services for athletes during Paris ...,"‚ÄúP&G‚Äôs commitment to providing a broad range of essential services and products within the Athletes' Village exemplifies our shared vision of supporting athletes in their pursuit of excellence‚Äù said Anne-Sophie Voumard Managing Director of IOC Television & Marketing Services. ‚ÄúThe introduction of the Olympic Village nursery a first in the Games' history highlights our dedication to inclusivity and athlete well-being ensuring that athlete parents have the necessary support to compete at their best.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."
PM,Philip Morris International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pb2wuY28uemEvc2F0dXJkYXktc3Rhci9uZXdzL2EtZnV0dXJlLWluLXdoaWNoLWNpZ2FyZXR0ZXMtYXJlLW9ic29sZXRlLWlzLXdpdGhpbi1yZWFjaC1zYXlzLWxlYWRpbmctaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC10b2JhY2NvLWNvbXBhbnktYmUzMTIzN2UtZjkwYi00ZGU5LTkzNDEtMGM1ZmViYzY5ZTNm0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A future in which cigarettes are obsolete is within reach says leading international tobacco company,"Johannesburg - Is it possible to live in a smoke-free world? Branislav Bibic certainly thinks so.

But the managing director of Philip Morris South Africa is convinced a lot needs to be done to achieve that goal. ‚ÄúThe technology exists to see the end of cigarette sales but this will not happen overnight. We need to work together with other stakeholders to have the right regulatory encouragement support from civil society and the full embrace of science. A smoke-free future is possible sooner rather than later.‚Äù Japan has already set the tone with cigarette sales in the country dropping by 34 percent in the last few years.

Scientists at Philip Morris International (PMI). Supplied image. Twenty two percent of the country‚Äôs adult smokers have abandoned cigarettes and switched to smoke-free alternatives in just four years. And Bibic believes that this trend can be spread to all corners of the world. He and his company Philip Morris International (PMI) have been working hard over the last few years to achieve a smoke-free environment.

The company is a leading international tobacco company evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company‚Äôs current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products including heat-not-burn vapour and oral nicotine products which are sold in markets outside the US. Since 2008 the company has invested more than $9 billion (about R150bn) to develop scientifically substantiate and commercialise innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes.

This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities notably in the areas of preclinical systems toxicology clinical and behavioural research as well as post-market studies. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also authorised the marketing of versions of PMI‚Äôs IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables as modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs) finding that exposure modification orders for these products are appropriate to promote public health. Bibic says that the company is working to achieve a bold vision ‚Äì to replace cigarettes with science-based smoke-free products as soon as possible ‚Äì and shifting its resources and fundamentally changing its purpose and operations.

‚ÄúWhile cigarette sales today remain the largest part of PMI‚Äôs business in most countries this is changing rapidly.‚Äù Bibic added that their flagship heat-not-burn cigarette alternative IQOS has made significant strides in Africa and their aim is to increase their IQOS user base in South Africa over the next three years. With South Africa currently being ranked among the top countries in the world in terms of smoking prevalence Bibic says it is important to address the problem with urgency.

‚ÄúAccording to the World Population Review South Africa‚Äôs total smoking rate in the country is at 31.4 percent with 46.8 percent of smokers being male and 16 percent being female. ‚ÄúMisinformation is threatening public health opportunities and hampering consumer rights. There is a need to realise that it is unethical to withhold access to accurate information about cigarette alternatives that can reduce the burden of smoking on society. ‚ÄúWe have a chance to make meaningful strides to impact public health. Addressing misinformation with facts and science is a collective responsibility to achieve a smoke-free future faster while misinformation is a persisting threat with real-world consequences for people who smoke in this country.‚Äù

Branislav Bibic managing director of Philip Morris South Africa. Supplied image. He added that too many adult smokers in SA remain unaware that better alternatives to cigarettes exist. ‚ÄúThere is clear public demand for a collective review of the facts and science about smoke-free products. In fact according to an international survey by independent research firm Povaddo fielded among more than 44 000 adults in 22 countries including South Africa it indicates that a balanced approach is needed for tobacco harm reduction success. ‚ÄúOver 80 percent of all South African respondents feel that a new approach to tobacco regulation is needed with only two in 10 nicotine consumers feeling their voices are heard or considered.

‚ÄúThis is supported by 75% of current adult smokers in South Africa who agree that the government needs to consider the role alternative products like e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products can play in making the country smoke-free.‚Äù Bibic says that persistent misinformation is causing confusion and holding back adult smokers who do not quit from making more informed choices than continued smoking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that accurate information about smoke-free products plays a critical role in helping adults who would otherwise continue smoking to change to less harmful alternatives.

‚ÄúProviding consumers with science-based information about better alternatives we can accelerate the decline in smoking rates helping to end the use of cigarettes once and for all.‚Äù Scientists at Philip Morris International (PMI). Supplied image. ‚ÄúWith the right regulatory encouragement support from civil society and the full embrace of science a smoke-free future is possible in South Africa sooner rather than later with cigarette sales becoming a thing of the past.‚Äù Bibic says the draft Control of Tobacco Products and Electronic Delivery Systems Bill provides the country with an opportunity to make this a possibility by differentiating the way in which scientifically substantiated products that don‚Äôt burn tobacco are regulated compared to cigarettes.

He says his company‚Äôs main aim is to simply end the sale of all cigarettes. ‚ÄúQuite simply we want to end the sale of cigarettes and believe that we should stop debating on whether reduced risk products should be made available but rather how fast to best help the men and women who would otherwise continue smoking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about striving to create a better future. The millions of men and women who would otherwise continue smoking deserve better options than cigarettes.

‚ÄúSmoke-free alternatives are a pragmatic solution to tackle the global challenge of smoking by helping those who don‚Äôt quit to replace cigarettes with less harmful alternatives.‚Äù Currently there are 1.1 billion smokers in the world. However these numbers aren‚Äôt expected to decrease by 2025. Bibic says this is due to the current fiscal and regulatory measures not accelerating fast enough.

‚ÄúWith the right regulatory encouragement support from civil society and the full embrace of science a smoke-free future is possible sooner rather than later with cigarette sales becoming a thing of the past. ‚ÄúRegulating smoke-free products differently to combustible cigarettes is a prerequisite to ending cigarette sales in South Africa as soon as possible. South Africa has a huge burden of tobacco use with about 12.7 million adults almost 30% of the population still using tobacco products despite being aware of the dangers of its use and exposure.‚Äù While Bibic is aware of the task they face to try and ‚Äúun-smoke‚Äù the world he says they will do all they can to achieve their goal.

‚ÄúThink of any industry that has undergone a seismic shift and you‚Äôll find disruptive innovation at the source. Car manufacturers have embraced electric vehicles; wearing a mask has become part of everyday life and recycling technologies allow us to reduce more of our waste. ‚ÄúThe tobacco industry is no different. With vast resources we‚Äôre committed to research and development to open the gateway to disruptive change in the tobacco industry. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not something we can do alone. Despite all the advances we are making we can achieve a smoke-free future faster if other companies governments regulators NGOs and public health all have a voice in the discussion and embrace positive change and drive it forward.‚Äù

He adds that it is crucial that the number of smokers drastically reduces in the next few years. ‚ÄúEveryone knows smoking is bad‚Äù says Bibic. ‚ÄúThe impact on public health is significant. South Africa is currently ranked among the top countries in the world in terms of smoking prevalence. ‚ÄúDespite a 5-month cigarette ban during lockdown stringent smoking restrictions and pending tobacco amendment bill the country remains at twenty-three among the countries with the highest smoking rates in the world.

‚ÄúIt would be ideal for the world‚Äôs 1 billion smokers to quit altogether but the indicators so far show that they will not therefore the most pragmatic approach would be to use products that eliminate combustion such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products. ‚ÄúPublic health experts agree that the harmful chemicals released from burning tobacco are the main cause of smoking related diseases not nicotine.‚Äù Experts agree that the harmful chemicals released from burning tobacco are the main cause of smoking related diseases not nicotine. Picture: Tracey Adams ‚ÄúSmoke-free alternatives generate lower levels of harmful chemicals and have an important role to play in reducing the health burden caused by smoking cigarettes.

‚ÄúWhile we know that these products are not risk-free and are addictive the science shows that they are a much better choice compared to continuing smoking traditional cigarettes. We also believe that in addition to existing efforts to stop people from starting smoking and to help them quit offering smoke-free alternatives to adults who choose to continue smoking can also have a positive impact on public health.‚Äù He believes that society‚Äôs desire for a new approach in addressing smoking is clear and that people want change ‚ÄúAccording to the ‚ÄòNew Approaches Required‚Äô survey conducted by PMI 87 percent of adults agree that governments should consider the role alternative products can play in making their country smoke-free. Scientifically substantiated smoke-free products are a better alternative than continued smoking and embracing science and innovation represents a major public health opportunity for South Africa.‚Äù

Bibic believes that ending all cigarette sales in the next 10 to 15 years is a possibility. ‚ÄúA future in which cigarettes are obsolete is within reach. We believe cigarette sales can end within 10 to 15 years in many countries. Today science-based innovative products that do not involve combustion offer a better alternative for those men and women who would otherwise continue to smoke. To be clear: These products are not risk- free. And the best choice is never to start smoking or to quit tobacco and nicotine altogether. ‚ÄúBut for those adults who would otherwise continue to smoke scientifically validated smoke-free products are a much better choice than cigarettes. Unfortunately political agendas and ideology are slowing progress and keeping millions of people uninformed. Rather than holding an evidence-based conversation on how best to regulate these innovative products to help adult smokers leave cigarettes behind we are often faced with an ideologically driven resistance from some public health organisations and some NGOs.‚Äù

PMI has enlisted top international technology and scientific talent to try and help un-smoke the world says Bibic. ‚ÄúThe way to a better future is through innovation collaboration and transformation. We can‚Äôt achieve this without the creativity of scientists engineers and technicians. Philip Morris International has a significant presence in Switzerland. ‚ÄúThe city of Lausanne is home to its global Operations Centre (OC) and PMI maintains its biggest research facility ‚Äòthe Cube‚Äô in Neuch√¢tel.",,,,,,,,,,,,
PSX,Phillips 66,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vb2lsY2l0eS5uZXdzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9vYml0dWFyeS1yaWNoYXJkLXRhbGJvdC1yb2JpdGFpbGxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: Richard Talbot Robitaille - Casper WY Oil City News,"Richard Talbot Robitaille: 1945 ‚Äì 2022

Richard Talbot Robitaille passed away peacefully with his family by his side on Aug. 20 2022 after a courageous and stubborn battle with cancer.

He was born Feb. 12 1945 in Fort Worth Texas to Earl Whitman Robitaille and Alberta Berry Robitaille. Rick grew up with his parents and two older brothers (Berry and Tom) in Graham Texas. After graduating from Graham High School in 1963 he attended the University of Texas at Austin where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity. It was there in his first college class that he met Donna Stafford. After a 20-month courtship they were married in Dallas Texas on July 16 1965. Daughter Karen followed and helped them cheer on their Longhorns. After graduating with a degree in political science in 1967 Rick went to work for Phillips 66 beginning a lifetime career in the oil business. While living in Billings Montana son John was born completing their family.

Rick moved his young family four times before settling in Casper in 1971. Rather than make another move Rick and Donna took a chance and it proved to be the right choice. Rick joined the Petroleum Association of Wyoming in 1972 enjoying a long successful career but once again an opportunity presented itself. In 2000 he joined Anadarko as manager of Public Affairs for the Western Division and took on new challenges until his retirement in 2011. He made lifelong friends in the oil business that he enjoyed until his final days.

Rick shared his love for the outdoors with Donna and his children. There were camping trips canoe paddling adventures to find the perfect fishing hole Yellowstone excursions bird and big game hunting ski trips and golf games.

He always supported Karen and John. Whether he was coaching or the voice from the stands they always knew he was there for them. Everything proved to be a teaching moment and in his special way it was fun.

With the arrival of grandchildren the teaching and sharing of things he loved continued to the next generation. He loved his five grandchildren unconditionally and could be found caddying for Austin and Amanda or in the baseball stands cheering on Thomas David and Jack always with words of encouragement and maybe a suggestion or two.

After retiring he and Donna spent their winters in Litchfield Park Arizona. Not only did they make wonderful new friends there but they were also able to enjoy time with many of their Wyoming friends who chose sun over snow. Their home was always Casper as that is where they‚Äôd find their family awaiting their return each spring.

The team joined the Bronco Overwatch and Rocket League players as the undisputed esports kings of the Mountain West. Their Spring 2022 season marks one of the best years the Bronco‚Äôs have had in the region. Unlike most tournaments the Mountain West has only one championship per year. Furthermore due to all schools being in close proximity to each other intense rivalries can form. One of these rivals is UNLV who the Broncos faced in the semi-finals and beat in a 2-0 sweep. The Bronco‚Äôs ultimately faced off against Hawaii and won in overtime in a nail biting 2-1 series.

The Mountain West has been one of the most supportive organizations when it comes to Esports. Boise State‚Äôs history with the Mountain West is quite extensive with the Bronco‚Äôs competing in a show match against UNLV all the way back near the beginning of the program. Boise State has even traveled on the road to face off in Mountain West matches heading to big names cities such as Las Vegas. Ultimately the 2022 year has been the pinnacle of many years of practice and determination for the Broncos and the perfect excuse for the writer of this news piece to use the fancy word ‚Äútrifecta‚Äù. For more information on how to join Bronco Esports check out our tryout page. And to see all upcoming Fall 2022 events go to Boise State Esports Twitch page.

Cypress Hill Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and Ying Yang Twins will join the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame rapper and actor on the concert showcasing legends of West Coast hip-hop.

Ice Cube aka O‚ÄôShea Jackson Sr. rose to fame as the primary lyricist and one of the rappers in N.W.A. the group that brought gangsta rap at its more hardcore out of Los Angeles to mainstream America in the late ‚Äô80s.

N.W.A.'s defining ‚ÄúStraight Outta Compton‚Äù recently hit No. 59 on Cleveland.com‚Äôs listing of the 100 greatest songs by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members.

Ice Cube went solo in 1990 releasing a stream of politically and socially provocative albums starting with ‚Äú‚ÄúAmeriKKK‚Äôa Most Wanted‚Äù ‚ÄúDeath Certificate‚Äù and 1992‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Predator."" He brought that realism to ‚ÄúBoyz n‚Äô the Hood‚Äù his acting debut and went on to star in dramas thrillers and comedies including the classic ‚ÄúFriday‚Äù which he wrote.

On ‚ÄúThe Predator‚Äù Ice Cube told Vibe magazine ‚ÄúI really just wanted to show people that I can rhyme. That it wasn‚Äôt all about controversial topics. It wasn‚Äôt just a gimmick about you know being the loudest voice or saying things that I knew that would make people react ‚Ä¶ I really had to show my MC skills. That I could pick topics from anywhere and make good records out of them.‚Äù

Ice Cube whose most recent high-profile screen appearance came in 2017‚Äôs ‚ÄúxXx: Return of Xander Cage‚Äù has appeared in more than 30 films since ‚ÄúBoyz N the Hood‚Äù from action pictures to family comedies and anchored the ‚ÄúFriday‚Äù and ‚ÄúBarbershop‚Äù franchises.

An entrepreneur as well as an entertainer Ice Cube‚Äôs most recent ventures includethe Big 3 basketball league.

Ice Cube‚Äôs latest foray into music finds him joining Snoop Dogg E-40 and Too Short in Mt. Westmore which released the album ‚ÄúBad MFs‚Äù on the metaverse blockchain in June.

‚ÄúWe released it in the metaverse but we gonna release it in the universe coming up soon and everybody can get a chance to hear what we did"" he said. ""It was fun man. I enjoy going on stage with those dudes hanging with them dudes.‚Äù

Cypress Hill essentially a co-headliner with Ice Cube is out touring after it‚Äôs gained new attention via ‚ÄúBlack in Black‚Äù its 10th studio album released earlier this year and the Showtime documentary ‚ÄúCypress HIll: Insane in the Brain.‚Äù

The film traces the roots of LA‚Äôs longest-running most successful hip-hop group and music‚Äôs most prominent cannabis ambassadors since Bob Marley.

Formed by rappers B-Real Sen Dog Eric Bobo and producer DJ Muggs Cypress HIll released its double-platinum self-titled debut in 1991 and followed it with 1993‚Äôs triple platinum ‚ÄúBlack Sunday.‚Äù

From the beginning the Latino hip-hop group championed marijuana from pot leaves on album covers through tracks filled with odes to THC tales of drug running and protests of harsh drug sentences to openly smoking on stage during their shows regardless of the legality.

Tickets for Thursday‚Äôs concert are $69 to $185 and are available at ticketmaster.com and on the Ticketmaster app. Tickets also can be purchased at the arena ticket office Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Cody Campbell calls his rapid rise in America‚Äôs hardscrabble oil patch a ‚Äúwild ride‚Äù.

Little more than a decade ago when Campbell was in his late 20s he was looking for his next act. Injury had cut short a brief professional American football career and the 2008 housing crisis had driven him out of the real estate business. It was then that he returned from Indiana to his native Texas and teamed up with a friend John Sellers to start buying up drilling rights in promising oilfields to ‚Äútry to make a little money‚Äù.

Neither men had much experience in America‚Äôs fiercely competitive oil business when they started. But Campbell now 40 years old says his stint in real estate helped as they acquired their first land for drilling. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have any money. We didn‚Äôt have any employees. It was just the two of us. And there were a number of times where we sort of bet it all on individual projects. Somehow it worked out‚Äù he says.

In fact it worked out better than Campbell could have imagined. Through his firm Double Eagle Energy the company he jointly owns with Sellers he has amassed a fortune over the past decade selling oil-producing operations to bigger players. Those deals now total nearly $10bn making Campbell one of the Texas oil patch‚Äôs most prolific dealmakers of recent years.

His breakthrough sale came in 2012 when he sold a cluster of oil and gas wells in Oklahoma for $250mn to the late wildcatter Aubrey McClendon who co-founded and ran Chesapeake Energy the large energy group.

The deals have only grown since. Most recently in 2021 he and his partners who now include private equity company Apollo Global Management sold a business in the Permian basin in Texas one of the world‚Äôs largest oilfields to oil company Pioneer Natural Resources for $6.4bn. That came on the heels of a $2.8bn sale in the same area in 2017 to Parsley Energy an oil and gas producer itself later bought by Pioneer Resources. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a wild ride going from basically just a bootstrap operation where we never knew from week to week whether we were going to make it to doing multibillion-dollar transactions‚Äù says Campbell.

Campbell like others in the Texan oil industry has been investing ‚Äî and taking profits ‚Äî despite mounting global concerns about the impact of fossil fuel emissions on climate change. They have ploughed on even as these worries combined with growing political pressure have pushed many financial investors to reduce their commitment to the industry ‚Äî and even pull out altogether.

In the US the Biden administration has cheered passage of the Inflation Reduction Act the biggest climate bill in the nation‚Äôs history which will channel $370bn into clean energy and electric vehicles over the next decade with the aim of slashing fossil fuel consumption.

President Joe Biden who once promised to transition America ‚Äúaway from the oil industry‚Äù called the bill the ‚Äúlargest investment ever in combating the existential crisis of climate change‚Äù.

At times in the years Campbell was making his fortune it seemed that sharp drops in oil prices would help climate campaigners by driving down fossil fuel production ‚Äî notably at the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in 2020. The consequent lockdowns saw US oil prices even briefly falling below zero hitting a negative $37.6 a barrel as world demand suddenly dried up. Hundreds of oil companies in Texas and across the US went out of business and it was a close-run thing for many more.

Campbell says he and his partners discussed ‚Äúshutting everything down‚Äù at one point during the pandemic but ultimately decided to stick to their original plans. ‚ÄúIt was tough for everybody and we were no different it was real stressful‚Äù he says of the period.

But in the volatile markets that rule the industry prices have since bounced back dramatically. They were already on the rise throughout 2021 as global demand driven by economic recovery was growing faster than producers could bring back supply.

It‚Äôs been a wild ride from a bootstrap operation where we never knew from week to week if we were going to make it to multibillion-dollar transactions

Then in February this year Russia sent its tanks into Ukraine. The war brought havoc to commodity markets and accelerated the surge in global crude prices which rose to $129/b in March the highest level since 2008. Though they have since fallen back to around $100/b prices remain far above the $64/b average for 2019.

In Texas this surge has delivered a bonanza to those such as Campbell that have invested in the shale revolution. Big publicly listed US shale oil producers such as Pioneer Devon Energy and ConocoPhillips proxies for the rest of the shale industry are making more cash than ever before.

Political pressure on the production and use of fossil fuel looms as large as ever as highlighted by the Inflation Reduction Act. But the industry is not short of support in the US especially in the Republican party which dominates Texas. In the summer of 2020 Campbell had an unexpected call from the White House. President Donald Trump who would go on to lose the election that autumn decided to visit one of Double Eagle‚Äôs operations in Midland Texas to signal support for the domestic oil and gas industry.

The ex-president was and is hugely popular in oil country where ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù flags fly and ‚ÄúTrump 2024‚Äù bumper stickers are plastered on the back of pick-up trucks. ‚ÄúHis support for the industry was really critical through that period‚Äù says Campbell of the man who he spent the day with.

As for the outlook now Campbell says that the high oil prices seen this year ‚Äî which he argues were exacerbated but not caused by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine ‚Äî are a sign of things to come.

Companies face difficulties raising funds to develop new oil and gas projects as banks and other investors shy away from the industry over climate concerns argues Campbell. He says that the oil supply picture in the coming years ‚Äúlooks very bleak‚Äù and he expects it to lead to relatively high prices for the foreseeable future ‚Äî which would be a financial boon to producers. ‚ÄúI keep thinking that the capital is going to come back with the high prices but it just seems like people are really hesitant to get back in‚Äù he says.

Billionaire oilman Tim Dunn also remains committed to fossil fuels. A Texan born and bred he has been in the industry since the 1970s and founded CrownQuest Operating based in Midland Texas in the mid-1990s. A well-known Republican he has used his oil wealth to back rightwing Republican candidates in Texas and advance conservative and evangelical Christian causes.

Dunn‚Äôs company like the rest of the industry was transformed when new shale drilling and fracking technologies helped unlock vast crude reserves in the oilfields of west Texas where his group owned vast swaths of land that had been deemed too expensive to produce. The huge Permian basin has turned from a dying oilfield into a juggernaut on global energy markets.

Dunn has expanded the business where he employs two of his sons Luke and Lee as vice presidents rapidly in recent years. It is one of the most active oil and gas drillers in Texas and operates more than 1400 wells turning out more than 115000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of oil and gas. CrownQuest ploughed more than $700mn into developing new wells in 2021 alone.

Analysts and bankers say CrownQuest which is privately held is among the most coveted Permian drillers among the larger companies that look for acquisitions in the area though Dunn has resisted selling so far. While the company keeps its finances under wraps analysts say a sale could command $5bn or more. Dunn credits a focus on ‚Äúmanaging risks‚Äù in a relentlessly turbulent business for the success. ‚ÄúI think that is one reason we have survived and prospered through exceedingly choppy waters‚Äù he says.

For Dunn this year‚Äôs surging prices has added fuel to his firm‚Äôs swift growth. The company which already produces more from the Permian‚Äôs oilfields than US supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron says it expects ‚Äúsignificant production growth‚Äù in the coming years.

Meanwhile for Campbell the price upswing has allowed his latest start-up in the Permian to take advantage of a strong tailwind. In June his Double Eagle raised more than $1.7bn from private equity firms including Apollo and Encap along with other investors to start snapping up more development land in the Permian oilfield.

The fundraising success came despite the dearth of capital in the industry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in growth mode and we have access to capital‚Äù says Campbell of the new venture. He says he‚Äôs hunting for bigger acquisitions in Texan oilfields this time round and has assembled a group of investors that can quickly pull off big transactions. The group is ready even for a $5bn deal he says: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just getting started.‚Äù

The acquisition intent is a big bet that the industry will keep making money despite the government-backed moves around the world to cut emissions and reduce the potentially disastrous effects of climate change.

The International Energy Agency predicted in a landmark report last year that spending on exploring for new oil and gas reserves would have to end now for the global economy to hit a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.

That said its base forecasts still see fossil fuel demand extending far into the future. And this year‚Äôs energy crisis driving fears of fuel shortages has scrambled the climate debate.

Politicians and consumers spooked by high energy prices have shifted their near-term focus from emissions reductions to securing energy supplies ‚Äî even if they are fossil fuels. Despite the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act President Biden has this year asked the domestic oil industry to increase supply to help bring down high fuel prices at the pump even if it means higher emissions. In Europe some leaders now want to soften climate targets.

Hallie Templeton US-based legal director at Friends of the Earth an environmental group slams the Biden administration and the oil and gas industry for continuing to expand oil output in the face of the climate threat. ‚ÄúBiden needs to remove his oil-tinted glasses and start treating oil and gas development with the extreme caution it deserves‚Äù she says.

Some of the oil industry‚Äôs biggest players have started eyeing a shift to cleaner fuels. BP Shell and TotalEnergies are ploughing money into solar projects offshore wind farms batteries and electric vehicle charging networks. Even the American oil supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron seen as more reticent to abandon oil and gas are investing in carbon capture and storage and hydrogen to try to cut their emissions and safeguard their businesses from the energy transition.

Campbell argues that the energy crisis that has roiled the global economy this year is a warning sign if leaders try to pull out of fossil fuels too quickly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm young and I have a young family and I worry about [climate change] too. But I think that there‚Äôs just a physical reality in the world that we need oil and we need natural gas. We‚Äôre seeing right now some of what happens if we don‚Äôt have it‚Äù he says

Only forced impoverishment can deliver us to a 100 per cent renewable future any time soon

Dunn is more scathing of policymakers‚Äô approach to climate change which he argues is being used as cover to extend the reach of government power. He argues they are rushing too fast to get the world off fossil fuels which he says remains central to global wealth and wellbeing. Rather than focus on eliminating oil and gas policymakers should balance the ‚Äúeconomic trade-offs‚Äù of cutting fossil fuel use and the potential harm from climate change. In short they should focus on adapting to a warmer world rather than try to prevent it.

‚ÄúOnly forced impoverishment can deliver us to a 100 per cent renewable future any time soon. Perhaps we should allow policymakers to first convert to this lifestyle and give us a full report on whether they prefer to continue in it‚Äù says Dunn.

Climate activists argue that the rapid drop in the cost of renewables and the risk of climate catastrophe mean a quick transition to cleaner energy is both needed and will ultimately be cheaper than running the global economy on fossil fuels. Yet from the Texas oilfields that transition looks a distant prospect.

Of oil Campbell says ‚ÄúWhen my kids have kids I don‚Äôt know. But certainly for the next couple of decades for the rest of my career it‚Äôs going be something that we need.‚Äù

Near the bustling Djibouti port one of the most important ports in Africa sits a several-square-meter-large Luban Workshop a Chinese supported skill and vocational training project. Named after Lu Ban an ancient Chinese woodcraft master who was born in 507BC during China's Zhou dynasty the Luban Workshop is also Djibouti's first institute of vocational education designated to improve the professional skills of the local workforce.Liban Fouad Osman who enrolled at the Luban Workshop in 2019 the same year the institute was set up in the country is set to graduate by the end of this year after three years of intensive railway skill training. After graduating Osman along with his other 23 classmates will start working for the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway the first electrified railway in Africa constructed by a consortium formed by China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) and China Rail Engineering Corporation.Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway is a mega infrastructure project under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the railway has fostered the development of various industries in neighboring areas which in turn calls for an amassing pool of professional workers. In the Vision 2035 put forward by Djibouti the country aims to build itself into a regional transportation hub in Africa and a logistic business and financial center in East Africa.Nurturing local talent""Students at the workshop are taught in a model called 'order-form teaching' which means that they are trained and equipped with targeted skills in collaboration with the enterprises they will work at after graduating"" Yu Zhongwu president of Tianjin Railway Technical and Vocational College (TRTVC) told the Global Times on Saturday.CCECC along with two Tianjin vocational colleges including TRTVC and Tianjin First Commercial School (TFCS) as well as the Tianjin municipal government and the Education Ministry of Djibouti jointly established the Luban Workshop which is first of its kind workshop in Africa that embodies Chinese craftsmanship.""We set up four majors at the workshop including operation and management of railway rail engineering technology business and logistics. The four majors have been certificated by local education authorities"" Yu said adding that the school blazes the trail in Djibouti's higher vocational education.Building upon an improved infrastructure network Djibouti is also constructing a free trade area (FTA) surrounding the Djibouti Port. Zhai Jingjing vice director of TFCS' financial and business institute told the Global Times on Friday that the workshop also trained talent for the FTA leveraging TFCS' expertise in business operation.Africa is rich in young and able workers and the professional training at the workshop also offers a new career path for African youth like Osman improving their future livelihoods observers said.Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan announced at the opening of the World Vocational and Technical Education Development Conference (WVTEDC) on Friday in Tianjin via a video link that China will build 20 more Luban Workshops with BRI countries and set up 20 more vocational education training centers in Africa so as to ""contribute Chinese wisdom to the development of vocational education in developing countries.""In September 2018 China announced that it would build 10 Luban Workshops in Africa to provide vocational training courses to African youth as part of efforts to deepen pragmatic cooperation with Africa and support the development of Africa.'Teach them how to fish'To date China has established about 20 Luban Workshops in 19 countries and regions including Thailand the UK India Indonesia Pakistan and Djibouti. Luban Workshop has become a bridge of friendship between China and foreign countries in educational exchange.Afifa Shajia Awais the Education Attach√© of the Embassy of Pakistan told the Global Times on the sidelines of the conference on Friday that Pakistan is in urgent need of more vocational training amid rapid industrialization and the set-up of more Luban Workshop is ""in line with the requirements of the industries"" which is also helpful in creating more jobs.""To develop our human resources I would stress the need for the two countries to engage more on different layers of [vocational education] and increase our cooperation opportunities"" she said.At WVTEDC's opening ceremony Sun announced that China will launch a global vocational technological education alliance to facilitate pragmatic cooperation in the sector.China also proposed to set up global vocational education reward scheme Sun said.""The Luban Workshop model exports Chinese-standard vocational education and its most important task is to train local teachers and they in turn will take the responsibilities to educate local students and this model will inject vitality to the sustainable development of local economy"" Yao Song the director of IT and automation institute under the Tianjin Light Industry Vocational Technical College told the Global Times on Friday.The college has participated in the construction of Luban Workshops in India and Egypt.As the old saying goes ""give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."" A total of 12000 people around the world have received vocational training in Luban Workshops and a total of 66 Chinese and foreign enterprises have established cooperation with Luban Workshop.At the conference industry insiders also took note of a critical role the workshop plays in securing talent that lay the foundation for carrying out BRI projects.""Most majors the workshop set up are in industries where there's a huge talent gap. In this regard it will strengthen the competitiveness of firms in those industries and promote a synergized development of local economy"" Yang Yan vice director of Tianjin Luban Workshop Promotion center said at the forum.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJpbnQuaW4vaW5kaWEvcmFpbHdheS1wb2xpY2UtYnVpbGRzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtc3RhbmRhcmQtc3BvcnRzLWdyb3VuZC1pbi1tdW1iYWlzLWdoYXRrb3Bhci8xMDkyMzM0L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJpbnQuaW4vaW5kaWEvcmFpbHdheS1wb2xpY2UtYnVpbGRzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtc3RhbmRhcmQtc3BvcnRzLWdyb3VuZC1pbi1tdW1iYWlzLWdoYXRrb3Bhci8xMDkyMzM0Lz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Railway police builds international standard sports ground in Mumbai‚Äôs Ghatkopar,"Mumbai Aug 21 (PTI) The railway police has set up an international-standard sports ground in Ghatkopar in Mumbai with help from Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and the International Amateur Athletics Federation (now known as World Athletics) a senior official said on Sunday.

EAST SPENCER ‚Äî Each year the Southern City Tabernacle AME Zion Church honors a particular member or in this year‚Äôs case a couple with the ‚ÄúLegacy of a Leader‚Äù award.

Sunday afternoon the congregation under the leadership of Pastor Patrick Tate paid homage to life members Cynthia and Rev. Albert Johnson who have been married for more than 30 years and involved in the church not just their entire married lives but since childhood. Both have served a variety of roles within the church.

Rev. Johnson served as preacher steward for more than 15 years before going into the ministry. He is currently associate minister of the church. In addition he began employment with Pittsburg Plate & Glass (PPG) Industries of Lexington on March 13 1973. On April 1 2018 he retired as laboratory technician after 45 years of work with the company. He had 45 years of perfect attendance with the company.

In his youth Rev. Johnson attended North Rowan High School playing on the varsity football team receiving certificates of honor and an honorary team jacket. He studied Kenshi karate and Kenshi Kai karate for more than 13 years and has received numerous competition trophies and a brown belt one level below black belt.

He has attended two years of AME Zion district studies four years of Western N.C. conference studies and in June 2013 was ordained as an elder in full under the Western N.C. Conference under Bishop George E. Battle Jr.

Cynthia has served the church on junior choir the usher board and the steward board for 22 years and has been a Leader of Leaders since 2004.

Cynthia retired recently from the NC Department of Public Safety ‚Äî Piedmont Correctional Institution where she worked for more than 20 years. During her time there she made history when she was the first Black American to be promoted to administrative secretary for the institution.

On retirement she received the Order of the Long Leaf Pine and the governor‚Äôs Old North State award. In her youth she attended North Rowan High School where she was an honor roll student and attended Livingstone College where she made dean‚Äôs list. She graduated from Salisbury Business College where she studied general business and was again on the dean‚Äôs list.

The couple have four children ‚Äî daughters D‚Äôyoka Nicole and LaTonya Nicole; sons Albert III and Carlee; and grandchildren Kneisha Amare and Jasmine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcGFjZS1uZXJkcy1hdC10aGUtYmVhY2gtYWVyb3NwYWNlLWdhbWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Space Nerds at the Beach: A Dispatch From the Aerospace Games,"If you‚Äôve ever watched the 2000s teenage-heartthrob movie Twilight you know there is an iconic thunderstorm baseball game scene between the Cullen Family and other vampires alongside the mere mortal Bella Swan.

Pride still remains for his previous employer though he‚Äôs switched jobs and no longer competes in the relay races: ‚ÄúWe were the third commercial space company to get to orbit after SpaceX and Rocket Lab.‚Äù The annual gathering at Dockweiler reminded him of his own journey.

‚ÄúIn a deep personal emotional way I knew what it was like being on the outside‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúFor me I just feel like I made it. I‚Äôm part of this community.‚Äù

Winning involves strategy as one Reddit user posted in a 2016 thread: ""SpaceX came in first place overall after stacking their tug-of-war team with factory floor workers!"" The entire competition is based on a points allotment system where winners receive 40 total points with each team at second place and below earning fewer points in each game. Relay races have batting orders of sorts designed to ensure that no one would get tired and that time isn‚Äôt wasted on player transitions. Even with all of this strategy however the goal for many participants is not first place.

‚ÄúPeople don't want to win first place because the first-place team has to plan next year‚Äôs Aerospace Games. So realistically you aim for second‚Äù says engineer Joan Marie Tubungbanua as she paints a red ‚ÄúJPL‚Äù stencil across a teammate‚Äôs face. For the past few years SpaceX and Northrop Grumman have alternated hosting duties. The 22-year-old NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) system engineer and University of Southern California masters student works on the Psyche mission to explore a metal-rich asteroid in orbit between Mars and Jupiter but today she was the wheel to the wheelbarrow duo in JPL‚Äôs lineup. Unfortunately this meant that she inhaled quite a bit of sand.

‚ÄúWe didn't expect the sand to be as deep as it is on the actual beach. And so we definitely had to adjust our strategy a little bit‚Äù chuckles Tubungbanua. Her teammate 19-year-old Kruti Bhingradiya a robotics intern at JPL and student from Gujarat points out that while corporate bonding games like cricket are prevalent in India the relay race in the United States was unique. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôve never seen baseball bats before.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,

Once complete the building at 1714 Sixth Ave. will house a nonprofit that helps Black and brown entrepreneurs build their businesses with the help of area professionals like lawyers accountants and planners.

To help test the concept he's working with Nadia La Baker and Jambo African Cuisine helping both launch booths at the Des Moines' Downtown Farmers' Market. Ashworth said the concept appears to be working and both owners have regularly sold out of their products each Saturday.

""This has been cool to watch it work"" he said adding ""It's more fun than making money making music making whiskey."" Beyond developing Center @ Sixth Ashworth is a hip-hop artist producer and founder of Media Fresh Records and creator of Ziyad Rye small-batch whiskey.

To get the businesses going Center @ Sixth in partnership with Principal Financial Group and EMC Insurance Cos. covered up-front costs for necessities like the pop-up tents cash registers tables and signage ‚Äî ""everything these businesses need to slide in and start making money"" Ashworth said. It also paid their Farmers' Market fees which can be more than $1000 said Aminatha Mkama owner of Jambo African Cuisine.

""It's helped a lot especially since I'm starting out of course"" she said. ""I would have to buy all of those things while I still invested a lot in this business.""

Mkama sells East African cuisine primarily from Tanzania where she originally was from. The main dish is a coconut cream rice filled with chicken beans and vegetables.

She said she wasn't sure Iowans would embrace her cuisine ‚Äî especially at 7 a.m. ‚Äî but that the customer base she built as a caterer and at festivals has grown tremendously since she started just a month ago. Last week's market was slow due to the Iowa State Fair she said but she was left with just four servings by the time the market closed.

""I am so blessed"" Mkama said. ""We have a lot of customers that we met from the festivals so I see them almost every Saturday. They're coming to pick up their lunches their dinner.""

Ashworth said Nadia La Baker which started at the market a few weeks earlier is in the same position. Owner Nadia Ahissou a French-style home baker of croissants baguettes and other pastries already has been able to upgrade her equipment and is looking for a storefront he said. could not be reached for comment.

Meanwhile Ashworth is preparing to break ground on the four-story $10 million development in the spring. The first floor will include three anchor tenants ‚Äî a yet-to-be-announced local coffee shop and a restaurant as well as a tasting room for Ashworth's Ziyad Rye featuring new and favorite products plus guest pours from other Black and brown whiskey producers.

In between the anchors there will be 1000 square feet of retail space and two food stands for businesses going through the incubator. The products will rotate as businesses come in and out of the program with the idea that customers can drop by any day and find something new.

""It will be mimosas one day and samosas another day"" Ashworth said.

The mezzanine will have classrooms for the entrepreneurs to learn business skills and offices they can use. Ultimately the goal is to get business owners prepared to set out on their own whether it's in a storefront or partnering with another business. Hy-Vee has pledged to sell some of the successful products Ashworth said.

The building also will have 32 apartments with 51% of the units reserved for renters earning 80% or less of the area median income.

Center @ Sixth recently received $1.8 million in tax increment financing from the Des Moines City Council. The council also agreed to provide a $300000 match should the Iowa Economic Development Authority choose Ashworth for a grant from the state's new Nonprofit Innovation Fund. Gov. Kim Reynolds created the $20 million fund this year with federal American Rescue Plan Act money to help nonprofit organizations expand to meet the needs of Iowans.

Ashworth said he was personally invited by Reynolds to apply. Eligible expenses include costs for construction acquisition site development engineering and architectural services.

Center @ Sixth is also accepting donations through the Community Foundation of Greater Des Moines.

Construction should take about 14 months.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today‚Äôs research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble‚Äôs shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical‚Äôs shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company‚Äôs da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG‚Äôs initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Only in a bizarre Wonderland - 48 hills,"‚ÄúWhy sometimes I‚Äôve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.‚Äù

‚ÄìThe Queen of Hearts in Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland

San Francisco yimbys have now declared themselves ‚Äúas progressive as it gets‚Äù in the welcoming pages of the San Francisco Chronicle. Claiming Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as one of their own they are now the article claims engaged in ‚Äúfighting inequality to protect the most vulnerable.‚Äù

Well not really actually fighting but certainly ‚Äúadvancing progressive ‚Ä¶policy goals.‚Äù The piece by Bilal Mahmood who ran for state Assembly in 2022 and lost explains that in the future will protect the most vulnerable that remain.

What are these yimby ‚Äúpolicy goals‚Äù and just how progressive are they?

Sen. Scott Wiener with Laura Clark a yimby leader at a forum on housing

Going deeper than the self-serving rhetoric in the op-ed it becomes clear that yimbys are now attempting to consolidate their national and state-wide media and legislative influence into local political power. And in San Francisco that means cloaking deeply reactionary policy as being ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù because in San Francisco ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù have a set of housing policies that actually do protect the most vulnerable among us.

Yimby‚Äôs are pushing Proposition D claiming it is an ‚Äúaffordable housing‚Äù program when in fact it undermines existing affordable housing development policies by granting public funding with no public oversight to high-density housing developments serving people who earn 140 percent of regional area median income which exceeds current market rate rents in most of San Francisco.

They are doing so because in San Francisco faith and community based non-profit developers have over the last 30 years or so created a permanently affordable housing production program that in fact produces hundreds of units a year able to afforded by poor and working people and prioritizes housing the currently un-housed. Some 40000 such units have been created using a variety of direct subsidy programs most locally based more than has been created in any other Bay Area county.

While this effort falls far short of meeting the actual need for truly affordable housing yimby‚Äôs now want to convert that program into a market-rate development scheme redirecting that public money to for-profit developers.

The New York Times The Atlantic and countless academics have embraced ‚Äúyimbyism‚Äù with an astounding stream of favorable articles coverage and comment by columnists. Not since the late 1950s has there been as board of a consensus among academics and the media on urban policy than that which has emerged around the two primary yimby principles: remove all local constraints and build new high density housing in urban areas letting the market solve the housing crisis by an abundant new supply‚Äîand housing costs will drop like a stone and the homeless will find a home in a condo tower.

Like the Queen of Hearts in Wonderland you must believe the impossible to accept this.

Yimbys and their allies have to overcome the reality that the two most expensive housing markets in the nation are the two most dense cities in the nation: New York and San Francisco a contradiction at the heart of their argument.

Like alcoholics who insist that drinking is not the problem but the solution to their problems yimbys argue that there simply isn‚Äôt enough high-density development and that this is because of local governments are under the total control of anti-housing forces who stop approvals of high density housing.

Here in San Francisco this core assertion‚Äîthe failure to approve critically needed market rate housing‚Äîis simply a Big Lie. San Francisco has approved some 104996 housing units since 1997 (DCP Housing Inventory). In the last seven years alone it has allowed developers to build more than 150 percent of the market rate units it needed to meet its regional housing goals (while meeting less than half of it regional obligation for affordable housing).

Of the 19878 condominiums (the major form of tenure for new construction) built between 2017 and 2021 96 percent are in highrise towers of 20 units or more according to the 2021 Housing Inventory (Table 17 page 29).

Only in Wonderland can it be asserted that we are not approving enough high-density market rate housing. Have housing prices and rents fallen in San Francisco as a result of these approvals? Are the un-housed fillings these towers? Again you have to be the Queen of Hearts living in Wonderland to believe that either is true.

The assertion that opposition of current residents to expanding the supply of housing especially affordable housing is the reason we have a housing crisis is demonstrably untrue and rests on another lie: That the city is responsible for the failure to build housing it regularly approves. It turns out that the biggest obstacle to building market-rate housing is market rate developers (the chief allies of the yimbys) responding to ‚Äúmarket dynamics.‚Äù

As of the fourth quarter of 2020 San Francisco has some 69453 units in our housing pipeline that have been approved by planning issued building permits or in the process of applying for them‚Äîbut only 5509 are actually under construction.

A major reason for this is that San Francisco has the highest construction costs in the world. And these steeply rising costs have nothing to do with folks slowing approvals. Instead supply-chain bottle necks and dramatic increase in the price of steel beams rebar and concrete all needed for high density high-rise construction are the culprits making new construction a very problematic solution to our housing crisis‚Äîa point never ever mentioned by yimbys.

It‚Äôs the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù that determines the pace of for-profit development for the simple reason that unless there is a clear profit to be made the housing is not built. As interest rates increase de-regulated land increases in price construction costs and materials prices soar public subsidies look more tempting for these for profit developers and their yimby advocates.

There‚Äôs another huge structural issue never addressed by the yimbys simple minded mantra of build build build: the financialization of the housing market and the impact that has on vulnerable urban populations.

Yimbys pretend that all the housing that is built in cities will be owned by folks who need housing and those people will live in them. In this Wonderland hedge fund managers are never mentioned as flippers of housing. Wall street firms never create financial instruments pool them together and then buy and sell thousands of bundled mortgages resting on mountains of debt.

In Yimby Wonderland the ‚ÄúGreat Recession‚Äù of 2008 simply never happened. In the real world by 2016 the issue of corporate control of housing was of such size and import that the United Nations appointed a Special Rapporteur to investigate and report on the problem.

The 2017 report renders laughable the yimby mutterings. Among other things it finds that ‚Äúhousing and commercial real estate have become the ‚Äúcommodity of choice‚Äù for corporate finance and the pace at which financial corporations and funds are taking over housing and real estate in many cities is staggering.‚Äù

In what sounds like everyday life in every neighborhood of San Francisco the reports states: ‚ÄúIn ‚Äúhedge cities‚Äù prime destinations for global capital seeking safe havens for investments housing prices have increased to levels that most residents cannot afford creating huge increases in wealth for property owners in prime locations while excluding moderate- and low-income households from access to homeownership or rentals due to unaffordability. ‚Äú

The report urges that states no longer be ‚Äútoo deferential to the dynamics of markets‚Äù and to take steps to ‚Äúbring private investment into line with the right to adequate housing‚Äù by working ‚Äù in collaboration with affected communities‚Äù by providing ‚Äúaccess to credit‚Äù which ‚Äúallows low-income households to finance construction‚Ä¶‚Äù

This sounds remarkably like community efforts here in San Francisco to create a municipal bank impose restrictions on market excesses organize community and faith based nonprofit profit housing developers and create though legislation new sources of affordable housing financing.

Guess who is absent from each of these initiatives and indeed opposes measures to accomplish these tasks as being harmful ‚Äúimpediments‚Äù to the construction of high-density market rate housing? Yimbys.

Yimbys deplore neighborhood and community-based organizations endlessly attack their leadership online disrupt press conferences and oppose effective advocacy for affordable housing‚Äîwhich often time means opposing high density market rate housing developments.

Even the Chronicle had to admit that the Mission‚Äôs getting some 649 units of permanently affordable housing required community based groups led by PODER and others organizing ‚Äúfierce community opposition‚Ä¶that derailed market-rate developers in order to satisfy the city‚Äôs affordable housing requirement.‚Äù

None the less yimbyism continues to thrive at the state and national level as academics and elite media continue to ignore inconvenient facts and fail to study or understand actual community-based efforts to develop affordable housing. Ezra Klein the New York Time columnist and yimby booster (who says he believes that Gavin Newsom is a politician of ‚Äúredeeming substance‚Äù) hypes a new yimby variant he calls ‚Äúsupply- side progressivism‚Äù.

Ignorant of (or more cynically ignoring) actual community struggles to increase the supply of affordable housing fought in San Francisco over the last 30 years like that most recently fought in the Mission Klein asserts that the ‚Äúleft‚Äù only concerns itself (‚Äúmost of the time‚Äù) with programs that aim at ‚Äúgiving people money‚Äù while being ‚Äúuninterested in the creation of the goods and services they want everyone to have.‚Äù And then in a blindingly ignorant assertion he states ‚Äú‚Ä¶in California‚Ä¶ progressives talked often of making housing affordable‚Ä¶but they didn‚Äôt talk much about increasing housing supply!‚Äù

Increasing the supply of permanently affordable housing is all that progressive San Francisco housers have been talking about for 30 years. And they have brought most San Francisco voters along with them. They have sent until recently one elected official to Sacramento after another to demand more funding for affordable housing production.

They wrote and passed the first general obligation bond ever used in the state for the expressed purposed of building new affordable housing. They devised legislation that created a new supply of middle income below-market-rate units to be required of market rate developers (legislation to increase the amount of BMR was consistently opposed by the yimbys).

They devised a tax measure on the biggest corporations in San Francisco to pay for the development of new housing able to be afforded by homeless people. And this year alone they have proposed Proposition E  a density bonus for market rate developers that require significant affordable housing as a necessary condition of getting the density bonus so much so that the yimbys are suing the measure to keep it off the ballot SF Democratic Socialists of America clear supporters of progressive housing policy have drafted and got on the ballot Proposition M which will tax vacant units often times owned by hedge funds and corporations that earmarks 50 percent of the tax to increasing the supply of permanently affordable housing while providing the other 50 percent for rent subsidies for seniors.

Between 2018 and 2020 San Francisco voters passed four measures raising a combined $1.5 BILLION for the expressed purpose of increasing the supply of affordable housing with one of the measures‚Äî Prop C of 2018‚Äîadding an additional $300 million annually significant portions of which is dedicated to increasing the supply of permanent affordable housing for un-housed San Franciscans. Which is why SF yimbys have placed on the ballot a measure to divert that public subsidy to market rate development.

As mentioned above yimbyism has created a consensus at the elite media and academic level not seen since the 1950s. That predecessor consensus was built around ‚Äúurban renewal.‚Äù All of the same kinds of academic experts and elite media opinion makers including SPUR) agreed that the happy convergence of state-mandated entities able to override local zoning and approvals (redevelopment agencies) using state and federal authority and funding could in one massive effort reverse two decades of urban neglect (the Depression followed by the war saw virtually no urban investment especially in housing) and produce a new urban core devoted to commerce with the residential uses moved to the country-side linked to the urban ‚Äúcentral business district‚Äù by freeways.

A perfect unity was created: freeways linking suburbia to a re-developed central city. What could possibly go wrong?

How the new consensus of the elite around ‚Äúyimbyism‚Äù is to avoid the errors and disasters of the urban renewal period is impossible to see since its advocates take no notice of that history. What is absolutely clear about ‚Äúyimbyism‚Äù is that its advocates have no actual experience with ‚Äúprotecting the vulnerable‚Äù in an urban context and indeed the core of their policy‚Äîthe unfettered development of high-density market rate housing‚Äîis the primary threat facing vulnerable urban populations.

A very real indication that yimbys learned nothing from the history of urban renewal can be seen in their co-opting of the of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) concept of ‚Äúsocial housing‚Äù as represented by Silicon Valley DSA backed Assembly member Alex Lee‚Äôs AB 2053 which died in committee this last June.

What is startling is that DSA also seemed to have learned nothing from the urban development wars of the last century either. The year-long advocacy by yimbys for the bill shows how eager they are to secure public funding for market rate development that threatens existing affordable housing production and how dangerously clueless a California Assembly member who claims to be a socialist is about the issue.

AB 2053 ‚ÄúThe Social Housing Act ‚Äú (Text ) is co-optation of DSA‚Äôs contribution to the current housing policy debate the confused abstract and itself un-historical concept of ‚Äúsocial housing‚Äù. Based upon a study done in 2018 by an Irish Social Democrat researcher Saoirse Gowan and US journalist Ryan Cooper (Social Housing in the United States) ‚Äúsocial housing‚Äù was quickly adopted by DSA the center piece of its housing policy.

The basic problem with the 2018 study is its total lack of any discussion of lessons learned from any actual urban housing movements or policy debates in the United States over the past fifty years a rather striking oversight. Indeed for Gowan and Cooper there is no history of community organizing or policy proposals addressing housing even worthy of mention in their study.

The lessons of countless community struggles against urban renewal are not mentioned. The discussion of housing policy in the paper is at 30000 feet oddly absent of any discussion of history or political detail of the countess local and community battles around housing.

For example while the paper never mentions that the Black Panther Party‚Äôs Ten Point Program includes two (four and ten) that directly relate to housing and housing policy and that sparked scores of community based efforts to restructure housing policy at the local level in many major cities in the United States ( including San Francisco Oakland and Los Angles) it spends an inordinate amount of space discussing housing policy in Vienna Finland and Sweden whose homogenous and overwhelmingly white combined population (17.5 million) is less than half of the wildly heterogeneous and totally mixed population of California.

None of those three countries had state power handed over to the private sector for-profit developers as happened in the United States under urban renewal. Nor did they have the history of popular resistance to that effort and the necessary politicalization of housing development that resulted. It is hard to imagine three less typical ‚Äúcase studies‚Äù to base a US housing policy on than Vienna Finland and Sweden.

For Gowan and Cooper and for Assemblymember Lee‚Äù social housing‚Äù means producing housing that is ‚Äúeconomically integrated‚Äù that includes both poor and wealthy people in the same building with internal subsidies between the two.

For Gowan and Cooper ‚Äúthe worst social ill in American cities‚Äù is ‚Äúconcentrated poverty‚Äù which produces ‚Äúhigher crime‚Ä¶drug abuse gang violence and a host of other problems.‚Äù A major cause of this ‚Äúconcentrated poverty‚Äù is ‚Äúpoor only public housing‚Äù that is housing programs that only target the poor.

The argument is clear if wrongheaded: it is as important to eliminate ‚Äúconcentrated poverty‚Äù in housing programs by designing in ‚Äúeconomic integration‚Äù as it was to eliminate ‚Äúslums and blight‚Äù by designing urban renewal programs. The intent of both programs is not to bring housing rights and resources to poor communities but to disperse them to bring higher class residents culture and economic activity to ‚Äúenlighten‚Äù a culture of poverty an incredibly condescending and reactionary formulation. By ignoring urban history they repeat it.

‚ÄúSocial housing‚Äù is simply the term used in Great Britain and the European Union for ‚Äúaffordable housing‚Äù and can take many forms from publicly built and managed housing developments to rent subsidy programs to publicly funded limited equity and co-op owned housing. These programs almost universally include income limits for residents just as they do in the US. It is interesting to note that the Thatcher government did in public housing in Britain by making a similar argument: that it was insufficiently economically integrated and that current residents needed to be ‚Äúempowered‚Äù to own the public assets privately opening up a wave of speculation that lured most residents to sell their units ending its affordability forever.

But for Gowan and Cooper social housing must include two essential qualities: It must result in new construction and the buildings must be economically integrated to avoid the ills of ‚Äúconcentrated poverty.‚Äù They argue that rent control and inclusionary zoning are simply unacceptable because rent control discourages new construction (a bogus argument usually advanced by the real estate industry and certainly not the case when new construction is explicitly exempted as in San Francisco) and inclusionary zoning usually contains specific income limits and thus risk producing ‚Äúconcentrated poverty.‚Äù

In a recent panel discussion in which Peter Cohen then co-director of the Council of Community Housing Organizations and Lee participated Lee stated that he was ‚Äúbored‚Äù with housing programs that had Area Median Income limits on participation a position at odds with the SF DSA branch as their Proposition M limits recipients of the vacant unit tax proceed to assisting household earning no more than 80 percent AMI. It seems that there is a rather significant ‚Äúcounty option‚Äù in DSA as to what is a truly ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù housing program.

AB 2053 was initially endorsed by several yimby front organizations and then quickly co-sponsored by yimby-endorsed Scott Weiner in the state Senate. At its heart the bill as introduced was all that yimbys have demanded in Sacramento: It would have created a state wide agency (‚ÄúCalifornia Housing Authority‚Äù) able to overrule or ignore local housing policy and issue debt for new housing construction. And like their previous state victories it was linked to regional housing targets as the agency‚Äôs ‚Äúcore mission‚Äù was to ‚Äúproduce and acquire social housing developments for the purpose of eliminating the gap between housing production and regional housing needs assessment targets and to preserve affordable housing.‚Äù

From the start the measure goes way off track. Note the agency ‚Äúcore mission‚Äù is not to INCREASE the supply of affordable housing but to ‚Äúpreserve‚Äù it that is not necessarily increase it at all. Instead the core mission is to make sure that counties meet their ‚Äúhousing needs assessment targets‚Äù. These targets are overwhelmingly market-rate units and thus AB 2053 sees ‚Äúsocial housing‚Äù as being overwhelmingly ‚Äúmarket rate.‚Äù

To make the point absolutely clear Section 64724 (a) states ‚Äúin all its operation the authority seeks to achieve revenue neutrality over the long term.‚Äù The bill defines ‚Äúrevenue neutrality‚Äù as ‚Äúa system in which all monetary expenditures that result from the development and operation of social housing owned by the authority are returned to the authority through rents payments on leasehold mortgaged or other subsidies.‚Äù (64672). So ‚Äúrevenue neutrality‚Äù uses a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù that is the same as a capitalist bank which is an odd formulation for any kind of socialist but easily embraced by a yimby.

What makes this social housing legislation work to make the entire operation ‚Äúrevenue neutral‚Äù is ‚Äúrent and mortgage cross-subsidization‚Äù the true heart of Lee‚Äôs social housing concept. The legislation defines cross-subsidization‚Äù as ‚Äúa system in which below-cost rents and leasehold mortgages of certain units are balanced by above cost payments on other units within the same multi-unit property so as to ensure the property‚Äôs overall revenue meets development and operational costs.‚Äù

It is clear that in San Francisco for example the Community Land Trust has worked well dealing with keeping existing tenants in an existing building when the building is threatened with being sold and the tenants evicted. In most cases tenants of these buildings pay varying amounts in rent depending on the length of time each spent in the building given the fact that rents are ‚Äúde-controlled‚Äù when a tenant leaves. It is equally clear that these various rents payments do act as an internal ‚Äúsubsidy‚Äù allowing the CLT to get a commercial mortgage at a rate that will keep most tenets at the present rent payments.

But the CLT buys the building with a public subsidy paying market price. Since the subsidy does not have to be paid back the CLT can structure a new mortgage for less than it paid for the building passing the savings back to the tenants in the form of existing or near existing rents and saving them from being evicted.

How ‚Äúcross-subsidization‚Äù would work in the saving of an existing buildings when the market purchase price has to be fully repaid is unclear. The legislation allows for some tenants to be removed so the assumption appears to be that the poorer tenants leave the better off stay.

The ‚Äúcore mission‚Äù of the authority is not to expand affordable housing by the acquisition of existing buildings but to ‚Äúclose the gap‚Äù on meeting regional housing goals in each jurisdiction which means new construction. How ‚Äúcross subsidization‚Äù works in new construction is a mystery. Other than an embrace of an ethics rarely found in real estate what program elements motivate an ‚Äúabove market‚Äù housing shopper to pay more for a similar unit in a new building than a low-income resident would pay in the same building? The bill offers some sweeteners as suggestions: above market owners can lease out the unit (perhaps on Airbnb?) while the lower income tenant must prove continued residence. The bill offers high income owners the right to sell their publicly developed unit for an amount that includes not only the original price any capital improvement inflation AND a ‚Äúreasonable return on investment.‚Äù

It seems then that the primary inducement for cross-subsidization is the same as it is for any real-estate investment: Profit‚Äîa truly odd formulation for a socialist even one from Silicon Valley.

But the real indication that nothings has been learned by Assembly ‚Äúsocialists‚Äù or yimbys from the hard lessons of urban real estate development wars and the battle with urban renewal can be found in section 64742 of the bill. In that section are the priorities to be used by the authority in ‚Äúacquiring or reacquiring property‚Äù‚Äîthe true ‚Äúbusiness end‚Äù of the legislation. Five priorities are listed but only one has the possibility of meeting the scale of development needed to close the ‚Äúgap‚Äù between what is built by the private sector and what is required in the regional housing targets for all of the state‚Äôs counties.

The four that if achieved would produce land and housing far below the necessary level set in the legislation are acquiring existing affordable and rent controlled units ‚Äúin danger of losing affordability status‚Äù buying ‚Äúparcels at risk of becoming unaffordable‚Äù ‚Äúsurplus public properties‚Äù and ‚Äúparcels near transit.‚Äù

Note that two don‚Äôt even attempt to expand affordable housing but simply preserve it. Most large cities have programs to do the same thing and this simply duplicates them but would then establish a ‚Äúrevenue neutral‚Äù policy that currently is not the case in San Francisco. Acquiring ‚Äúparcels near transit‚Äù would be if funded potentially land for a large number of units especially in San Francisco and other urban areas with transit and none in the posh suburbs of many legislators in Sacramento. It would also mean a major wave of evictions and demolitions as most transit lines serve existing residential neighborhoods.

But the ‚Äúpriority‚Äù for the California Housing Authority that should grab our attention is ‚ÄúUnderutilized parcels or redevelopment of underutilized parcels with affordability covenants or rent controlled units.‚Äù The bill defines ‚Äúunderutilized parcel‚Äù as ‚Äúa parcel of property upon which is built a structure that contains fewer units permissible under local zoning regulations.‚Äù

This is a rather disingenious definition as the state as recently pre-empted all local zoning classifications with mandatory density bonuses which render ALL residences in existing zones being ones that ‚Äúcontain fewer units‚Äù than allowed.

Thus the stage is set for a new period of ‚Äúurban renewal‚Äù this time under the banner of ‚Äúsocial housing‚Äù being developed by a state agency. Indeed the actual language‚Äî‚Äúredevelopment of underutilized parcels‚Äù‚Äîis the same as used in the urban renewal period. And being a state housing authority just like the old redevelopment agency created and finally killed by state law in 2012 it has the right of ‚Äúeminent domain‚Äù or the ability to condemn private property with the ruling of a single judge; no jury no trial.

Housing developed using public money in San Francisco does not have to be ‚Äúrevenue neutral.‚Äù Indeed the only way truly affordable housing can be produced is if the public money used in its development does not have to be repaid. Affordable housing development must pay market rates for land labor professional services (architects engineers lawyers etc.) and building materials. The community-designed affordable housing system in San Francisco uses public money mainly locally generated‚Äîallocations from the general fund development fees on office developers general obligation bonds fees on hotel and condo conversions large real estate transfers‚Äîto ‚Äúwrite-down‚Äù those fixed market costs so that monthly rents or mortgage payments are able to be afforded by lower income households defined by area median income. The public development subsidy makes costs affordable only if it is a true subsidy not to be repaid.

Based upon these proven policies and programs San Francisco‚Äôs DSA Supervisor Dean Preston authored a local ‚ÄúHousing Stability Fund‚Äù ordinance which specifically funded the development of social housing and which was not linked to new construction regional housing targets did not require the housing to be revenue neutral limited it to being 100 percent affordable to households earning no more than 80 percent of area median income does not require ‚Äúcross-subsidization‚Äù and no ‚Äúreasonable rate of return on investment‚Äù when an owner sells a unit purchased with public funds.

As the private for-profit housing market sees its costs dramatically rising its allies the yimbys have turned to seeking public funding of market rate development at both the state (AB 2053) and the local levels (Prop. D) . Aided by a willing chorus of elite opinion makers and careerist state legislators and ignoring the hard-won success of local community and neighborhood housing advocates yimby are transforming themselves into ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù to legitimize the raid on public funding.

In some cases it has resulted in naive and inexperienced politicians being willingly enlisted in their Alice in Wonderland formulations. So are the yimbys the new ‚Äúprogressives? Certainly one California Assembly ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù seems to believe so. And so too does at least one socialist congressmember from New York City.

New Jersey‚Äôs second-largest city with a population just under three hundred thousand is seeing a ‚Äúspate of new luxury apartments luring New Yorkers across the Hudson River with more space and amenities than they could afford near their offices.‚Äù As a result rent is skyrocketing across the board and working-class tenants are beginning to feel the squeeze. But the corporate-developer-driven agenda for Jersey City is facing pushback from grassroots organizers. If real-estate interests are trying to put Jersey City on the map as a shining example of a luxury commuter city socialists and progressives are attempting to put it on the map as an equally shining example of what effective resistance can look like.

Sleaze Prevails Overlooking the Statue of Liberty Jersey City has long been known as the ‚ÄúGolden Door‚Äù to working-class immigrants. It consistently ranks among the most diverse cities in the country often in the top spot. Amid the population boom and industrial growth of the mid-nineteenth century Jersey City corporate and political elites captured the new wealth created by an influx of new laborers from around the world. In the early twentieth century Jersey City was dominated by Mayor Frank Hague or ‚ÄúBoss Hague‚Äù whose cartoonish corruption lives on in the enduring trope of the New Jersey political machine as seen for example in the HBO show Boardwalk Empire. Ruling Jersey City from 1917 through 1947 the Democratic Party boss played kingmaker for governors and senators and allied with the Chamber of Commerce to fight the ‚ÄúRed Communists‚Äù of the CIO. At the same time ‚ÄúHague enticed sweatshop factories fleeing nascent unionization out of New York City while also allowing the American Federation of Labor to organize more skilled workers on a strict no-strike agreement‚Äù write Mary Rizzo and Whitney Strub in the Washington Post.

Meanwhile a former adviser to Fulop is soon headed to trial having been indicted for tax evasion while expediting development permits.

Dressing like it‚Äôs 1999 is now cool say owners of new vintage shop

The premise for a Progressive Insurance TV commercial is a life coach who helps prevent home buyers from becoming their parents. In terms of style however becoming your parents is now cool part of a Y2K nostalgia that continues to rule in vintage.

‚ÄúA lot of people like to dress like their parents now‚Äù said Kevin Dong who opened Paisley Vintage with his brother Michael a year ago. ‚ÄúAnything 20 to 30 years old is resurfacing.‚Äù

That means knitted sweaters with collars or crew necks in argyle or graphic prints ($25-$30) or mesh and lace tops ($14-$22). The store‚Äôs most popular items across the board: vintage T-shirts with graphic nature or cartoon images ($18-$30).

The brothers are 20-somethings who both trained at UCLA as engineers (Kevin in mechanical; Michael in biomedical) and live in Concord. During the pandemic they got the idea of turning their hobby into a more permanent business. They had done vintage sales previously in Berkeley and thought that the city‚Äôs demographic chock full of college shoppers made it the perfect place for their first brick-and-mortar store.

Their 800-square-foot storefront steps from campus also happens to be near two popular eateries that create foot traffic: Great China and U Cha bubble tea. Maybe that‚Äôs why business has been a lot better than the brothers expected.

‚ÄúA lot of the Cal students have been repeat buyers which helps a lot‚Äù Kevin said. The brothers don‚Äôt do a lot of social media so word is spread the way their parents did it. ‚ÄúWe get a lot of our customers by word of mouth‚Äù Kevin said ‚Äúwhich is pretty awesome.‚Äù

Pacific Center for Human Growth historic LGBTQ center to have its home razed

The Pacific Center for Human Growth has to leave the building it‚Äôs called home since 1978. Credit: Joanne Furio

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre definitely not closing‚Äù said Lasara Firefox Allen the executive director of the Pacific Center for Human Growth the third-oldest LGBTQ community center in the U.S. and one of the largest serving 630 people. The center which has been operating mostly remotely since the pandemic also operates the only sliding-scale mental health clinic serving the LGBTQ community in Alameda County.

In a July email Allen notified stakeholders that the two-story clapboard building the center has occupied since 1978 has been sold to Panoramic Interests a developer of many Berkeley-based projects. Panoramic plans to raze the building and replace it with a five-story apartment building with 35 units three of which would be reserved for very low-income renters according to an application filed in August. The development would include 2000 square feet of commercial space on its ground floor.

‚ÄúHeartbreaking as it is to lose a location that has so much connectivity for folks I think ultimately the move will benefit the center in many ways‚Äù Allen said in a phone interview. ‚ÄúWe may find a space that suits our needs better.‚Äù

The center conducted a survey on Aug. 1 and found that one of the main complaints was that the current location is not entirely accessible though it does have a ramp.

Allen estimates that the organization will probably have to move by next summer ‚Äúat the soonest.‚Äù She said Panoramic Interests has been ‚Äúa good citizen‚Äù and told the center it can stay from one to five years in its current building. The developer has also offered to rent the center a space in its new building whenever that is completed.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still in the discovery stage‚Äù Allen said. One thing‚Äôs for sure: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre definitely going to stay within the city limits of Berkeley.‚Äù

A new recording studio neared completion. And flood- and weather- damaged walls leading to the main concert hall stood ready to be restored.

In some areas exposed brick remained intact a reminder of the nearly 100-year-old historic building‚Äôs character.

Soon the roof will be updated the third floor readied for use and the iconic marquee replaced.

It‚Äôs all part of $50 million in renovations upgrades and additions to programming and staffing underway at Newark Symphony Hall as it attempts to reclaim its splendor and open its doors to artists patrons and community members alike.

‚ÄúThe biggest impact will be on the southern end of Broad Street which really serves as another entry point coming into the city particularly from the Newark airport‚Äù said Fayemi Shakur Newark‚Äôs arts and cultural affairs director.

‚ÄúIt is a cultural gem that many Newark residents have fond memories of.‚Äù

Shakur‚Äôs hopeful they‚Äôll make more.

Free salsa dancing classes are held in the Terrace Ballroom every third Friday. And this fall the staff will offer ballet instruction to area youth in a partnership with New Jersey Ballet.

The staff has rebranded the Children‚Äôs Performing Arts Academy as Studio 1020 a free program for Newark residents that offers community-centered art education to ensure the community benefits from the building‚Äôs renaissance.

A two-day showing of A Raisin in the Sun is scheduled for mid-September. In November Thee Phantom & The Illharmonic Orchestra which combines hip-hop with sounds of orchestra created by musicians of color takes center stage.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about centering the cultures of the community creating opportunities and making sure the community is a full participant in the revitalization‚Äù said Taneshia Nash Laird Newark Symphony Hall‚Äôs president and CEO.

‚ÄúTypically when a place is revitalized it is also gentrified so it is pushing people out‚Äú she said.

‚ÄúHere is an opportunity for us to create a case that you can do this and be inclusive in every aspect of the work.

Jamie Grundy a Newark native attends soul line dancing classes in the Terrace Ballroom every second Friday.

‚ÄúThe things that Newark Symphony Hall brings to Newark are excellent the different plays parties‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a staple in Newark for so many years back when my mother and father would go.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd we appreciate them‚Äù Grundy said. ‚ÄúIt is for the community.‚Äù

Founded in 1925 Newark Symphony Hall is on the national register of historic places and was once lauded as the place to perform. In its heyday in the 1920s through the 70s the 160000-square-foot more than 3500-seat concert hall on Broad Street brought artists like Billie Holiday The Beatles and Gladys Knight who played to sold-out crowds. It was also a hub for classical music opera and jazz attracting the residency of The New Jersey Symphony. But Nash Laird said disinvestment sent the music hall into crisis.

As the demographics of Newark shifted from white residents to predominantly people of color many believe there was deliberate disinvestment and a strategic decision to no longer keep up Newark Symphony Hall.

‚ÄúIn the 1980s the city itself was getting browner and Blacker‚Äù Nash Laird said. ‚ÄúAssets that were patronized by Black and brown residents were less valued.

Another factor Laird added was the state-financed construction of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center or NJPAC about a mile away. Completed in 1997 after planning by a state commission began 11 years earlier NJPAC is one of the largest performing arts centers in the country a popular venue for concerts and events praised for its acoustics and aesthetics alike.

‚ÄúThe construction of NJPAC affected Newark Symphony Hall because there was a disinvestment from our historic venue in favor of a new performing arts center‚Äù she said.

Nash Laird cited a dissertation on NJPAC‚Äôs development that quoted the mayor‚Äôs father poet and activist Amiri Baraka saying ‚ÄúNJPAC would be the white institution and Symphony Hall would be the Black institution.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmiri Baraka was right‚Äù Nash Laird said.

Nonetheless Newark Symphony Hall remained open and in 2016 officials realized its value and funded a preservation plan for it.

‚ÄúI imagine that many people thought that there wasn‚Äôt a place for two thriving performing arts centers. But because [of] senators and assemblymen who advocated we are now getting long overdue financial support with the goal of remedying decades of disregard and neglect.‚Äù

Now with state and federal funding grants and donations supporters hope Symphony Hall will upgrade its space increase its staff of 10 and extend its reach into the community something Nash Laird committed to doing when she started in 2018.

Newark Symphony Hall is owned by the Essex County Improvement Authority and operated by the Newark Performing Arts Corporation a non-profit founded in 1986 ‚Äì the same year planning began for NJPAC.

The $50 million revitalization effort is supported through philanthropy state appropriations state tax credits and federal historic tax credits. Included are a Mellon Foundation grant which provided $750000 to the hall; donations such as the $2 million gift from Prudential Financial; and a $1 million stipend provided by the city.

‚ÄúTen million of that money will go toward infrastructure upgrades mechanical electrical and plumbing‚Äù Nash Laird said. ‚ÄúThe rest is toward the restoration of the plaster. There‚Äôs marble and then all the new walls and finished work.‚Äù

Partnerships have been most beneficial to Symphony Hall‚Äôs success and longevity. So in the spring it partnered with NJPAC for the Festival of Praise a gospel concert held in Sarah Vaughan Hall the main concert venue.

David Rodriguez NJPAC‚Äôs executive vice president and executive producer said ‚Äúit is always a pleasure to collaborate with the symphony hall team. It‚Äôs an integral part of the cultural fabric of Newark.‚Äù

Symphony Hall also is partnering with Princeton University on two social impact fellowships and a production assistant training program with Newark Alliance.

The concert hall also has a bi-coastal partnership with Where Art Can Occur Theater Center (WACO) in Los Angeles.

‚ÄúThe impetus for partnering is that we are two Black institutions who are serving and providing a space for Black artists who are presenting and producing work in front of Black audiences‚Äù Shay Wafer WACO Theater Center‚Äôs executive director said.

Newark Symphony Hall is focused on capacity building and reframing who occupies the spaces of classical and orchestral genres hoping to amplify the voices of diverse artists.

‚ÄúFor me it seems like a good fit us being an ensemble of predominantly African American musicians and musicians of color and the Newark Symphony Hall being a pillar especially for Black and brown folks‚Äù said Jeffrey McNeill Illharmonic Orchestra‚Äôs leader.

The staff is planning programs with Colors of Classical music an organization that connects classical musicians of color.

‚ÄúThe classical music community hasn‚Äôt always been welcoming to musicians of color because the tradition is rooted in whiteness and that can make it daunting for people to make it in this field‚Äù said Mansi Shah Colors of Classical Music‚Äôs founder.

Shakur said ‚ÄúThe local and state funding is a signal that things are changing and the venue still has value and meaning to us.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlans to revitalize that Lincoln Park neighborhood have been in place for a long time‚Äù she said referring to the area that encompasses Symphony Hall. ‚ÄúAnd we are finally getting the support that we have needed from the state and other funders to make the renovations and revitalization of Symphony Hall a reality.‚Äù

Shakur a Newark native said the annual Lincoln Park Music Festival which has taken place for 15 years helped change the energy of Lincoln Park.

‚ÄúThat park for a long time was overrun with open drug sales prostitution and homelessness and that festival brought thousands of people to the park in the spirit of music and dance and joy and really shifted the energy in Lincoln Park‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúAnd I believe the revitalization of Symphony Hall will do the same.‚Äù

Nash Laird said a research study by the Knight Foundation found communities of color value the arts the most outside of affordable housing transportation and available jobs.

‚ÄúThe arts are what tie those populations to the community‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis revitalization says to the community we see you we see what you value and we‚Äôre going to lift that up.‚Äù

According to a statement from State House Mr Museveni met the NRM Parliamentary Caucus on August 19 at Kololo Ceremonial Grounds where he said only profit-making parastatals should be spared.

Citing an example of the National Enterprise Corporation (NEC) the commercial arm of the Uganda People‚Äôs Defence Force Mr Museveni said apart from research institutions and farmers‚Äô institutions the government is seeking to retain only money-making parastatals.

‚ÄúIf the government wants to have parastatals have money-making parastatals so that when you say you have got a board it is a money-making board; not a money-eating board. Have no board where there is no money making‚Äù he said.

The most recent Auditor General‚Äôs report indicated that only 13 out of the 26 public corporation and state enterprises analysed made profits. Some included Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Ltd (UETCL) Uganda Electricity Generation Company Ltd (UEGCL) and National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) which posted profits of Shs112 billion Shs91.9 billion and Shs47.8 billion respectively. These however were not paying any dividends to the government.

The Public Service ministry in 2018 released plans to realign government ministries departments and agencies (MDAs) to address challenges of duplication of work overlaps of mandates conflicts and wasteful expenditures among others.

In February 2021 Cabinet approved a roadmap for rationalisation of government agencies commissions authorities and public enterprises.

Mr Museveni‚Äôs impromptu meeting with the legislators comes two months after the House through a report by an Ad Hoc Committee raised concern about the impact of the proposed rationalisation of government agencies urging the ministry to protect employees whose agencies have been affected.

Parliament where NRM has majority seats criticised the ministry for reportedly embarking on the mergers without a comprehensive study of the whole government machinery for service delivery limited consultation on the legal and economic costs involved and without a business continuity assurance study.

Parliament had given Mr Muruli Mukasa the Public Service minister two months to revert with a better plan.

Mr Museveni on Friday however made a case for the proposed mergers whose aim the government says is to save the country billions of shillings.

‚ÄúThe total cost savings arising from the rationalisation of 53 government agencies and functions per annum will be Shs649b‚Äù Ms Mary Grace Mugasa the junior Public Service minister revealed adding that the money to be saved includes savings from expenses on wage facilitation of governing boards and councils NSSF contributions non-wage expenses development expenditure gratuity and rent.

Ms Mugasa explained that out of 157 government agencies which were reviewed in 2018 the government took a decision to retain 88 and merge mainstream and transfer the functions of 69 agencies.

The first phase of the rationalisation exercise has been concluded with 53 out of the 69 government agencies harmonised while the 16 will be rationalised in phase two of the next financial year.

She argued that some of the agencies were created without clear justification while others had their mandates overtaken by events.

‚ÄúThere are agencies that naturally should not be affected like Bank of Uganda Mulago hospital Micro Finance Support Centre Uganda Development Bank [and] Uganda Revenue Authority [among others]‚Äù Mr Paul Omara (Otuuke County) said adding ‚ÄúThe President is now accelerating because in his view the money is not available‚Ä¶ This makes economic sense. For instance UNRA apart from just doing procurement and then passing money to the contractors there is no value for money that they add. This can be handled as a department under the ministry of works.‚Äù

Whereas the government indicates that billions of shillings will be saved Mr Godfrey Wakooli (Butiru County) says emphasis should be placed on where such saving will be.

‚ÄúI feel this should not stop there but there should be a follow up on these monies that they are planning to save‚Äù Mr Wakooli said adding ‚ÄúDuring Covid a lot of money meant for meetings was saved but we were not told where the money went‚Äù

The lawmaker also demands that a further audit be conducted to put a figure to the money that government would save by collapsing so-called superfluous agencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This is for pre-trial conference.



Sade Kwate‚Äôe had already pleaded not guilty to one count of Sedition two counts of unlawful assembly and one count of arson at a previous court date.



The charges relate to incidents on 24th and 25th of November 2021 in Honiara.



The prosecution alleged that on 24 November Kwate‚Äôe led a group of people to protest at the Parliament House to demand the Prime Minister to step down.



Then on the next day Kwate‚Äôe allegedly assembled a group of people and procured them to set fire to the Naha Police Station at Naha.



This was at the height of the three days of violence in Honiara which left the city‚Äôs Chinatown in ruins and business houses and shops in Honiara looted and set on fire.



The Bank of South Pacific (BSP) branch at Ranadi Kukum Traffic Centre and part of Honiara High School were also burnt to the ground.



The Naha Police Station was ransacked and also set on fire but the fire was put out by the Naha community.

Designed by Mancini Duffy and developed by Highland Development Ventures LLC and The Davis Companies the 223-foot-tall structure will yield 180000 square feet and 6300 units. The developers acquired the property in early 2021 for $62.5 million and construction costs are estimated at $84 million. Div West 29th Street LLC is the owner Cauldwell Wingate is the contractor and McNamara Salvia is the structural engineer for the property which is located between Sixth and Seventh Avenues.

Excavation was still ongoing at the time of our last update in January with most of the work obscured behind sidewalk fencing. Now the reinforced concrete superstructure has risen above the first setback. The reduction in floor plate size from the tiered massing should enable construction to proceed at a faster pace as work progresses with topping out possible by this winter.

The rendering in the main photo is oriented looking north from across West 29th Street and shows the look of the main southern elevation. The building is mostly windowless and clad in dark gray horizontally corrugated metal panels and the setbacks will be illuminated with upward-pointing spotlights. The ground floor features floor-to-ceiling glass surrounding the front doors and drive-in loading dock.

The Class A self-storage facility will feature all-electric systems with full climate control electronic access control security monitoring motion-sensor lighting and a comprehensive sprinkler system.

155 West 29th Street is targeting a completion date of spring 2023.

The county council on Thursday approved purchasing the Allen Township land for $225000 with sellers Paul and Wasyl Mauser donating $675000 worth of the property.

With the donation county officials labeled the deal a bargain sale and waived a second appraisal that would ordinarily be required for a real estate deal under the county‚Äôs administrative code. The fair market value for about 45 acres of the land is $900000 or $20000 per acre; the county is instead paying about $5000 per acre and is applying for a Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources grant to cover the purchase.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually a very pretty property‚Äù county Parks and Recreation Superintendent Bryan Cope said of the land he said boasts forest wetlands some steep hillsides and a stretch of the Hokendauqua Creek.

It‚Äôs at 4551 Indian Trail Road and known as the Bodnarczuk Preserve. The Mausers selling the county 58.07 acres in all but will retain 16 acres for agriculture after the county has the land subdivided Cope said.

The Mausers are brothers and Bodnarczuk was the last name of one of their sets of grandparents WFMZ-TV 69 reported. Attempts to reach the Mausers for comment by lehighvalleylive.com have been unsuccessful. They own Kopper Penny Self Storage LLC at 2700 Howertown Road in Allen Township.

Closing on the sale is scheduled for Dec. 15.

County officials did not immediately comment on when the property would be open for public use or where parking would be. Wasyl Mauser also agrees under the term of the sale contract to donate a pedestrian bridge over the Hokendauqua Creek near the location of a former suspension bridge on the property.

Cope described development pressure on the property as imminent and immediate and called the purchase a prime example of preserving core watershed lands.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre spending so much time talking about warehouses truck traffic and air pollution. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre drawing enough attention to all the green and open space that we have preserved in Northampton County‚Äù county Executive Lamont McClure told council‚Äôs Energy Environment and Land Use Committee that reviewed the purchase Thursday prior to the full council‚Äôs approval later that night.

State and local officials plan a groundbreaking ceremony Monday for the Maine International Cold Storage Facility a 107000-square-foot building sited on Commercial Street next to Maine's sole shipping container terminal. The warehouse has been touted as critical to expanding freight through Portland and giving Maine food and beverage companies a competitive edge and access to markets.

Pandemic disruptions delayed permitting and construction plans but also demonstrated a continued need for refrigerated storage in Maine said Matt Burns executive director of the Maine Port Authority. ""We have always known there is significant demand for cold chain logistics. Cold storage has always been part of the master plan"" Burns said. ""That demand for food and beverage products and cold storage did not decline and wane during the pandemic it seemed to get stronger.""

Plans for the warehouse were approved by the Portland Planning Board nearly two years ago. The building price has grown from $30 million to $55 million. Construction is expected to finish early in 2024.

The warehouse is a public-private partnership between the port authority and developers Amber Infrastructure Group an international company with headquarters in London and Treadwell Franklin Infrastructure a financing company based in Yarmouth. The state of Maine contributed $8 million to the project money dedicated to preparing the property for building. The warehouse will sit on leased state land.

Plans were approved but a lengthy permitting process went into 2022 said Tom O'Shaughnessy co-founder of Amber Infrastructure. Through permitting the project was redesigned to lower the building height to 55 feet move refrigeration and mechanical systems to face the port and modify the Commercial Street frontage O'Shaughnessy said.

Story continues

""At every step of the way we were able to address concerns and improve the building at the same time"" he said.

A large rooftop solar array is planned for the project and projected to generate enough electricity to provide 20 percent of the warehouse's energy use.

Since it was first proposed in 2015 the cold storage project faced stiff opposition from West End neighbors concerned its height would block harbor views and increase traffic on outer Commercial Street. An original proposal from Americold a major refrigerated storage company was shelved in 2018 after a lengthy and contentious zoning and planning process. Cold storage plans were revived the same year with a public-private partnership between the state and developers.

Refrigerated storage next to the International Marine Terminal container port will likely draw new customers including clients of Eimskip the Icelandic shipping company that specializes in transporting cold and frozen freight O'Shaughnessy said. Since starting trips to Portland in 2013 Eimskip the sole company landing at the terminal has increased freight volume by 20 percent on average per year with almost 38200 containers crossing the Portland docks last year.

Though Eimskip's clients are likely users of the 21750 pallet-space warehouse there will be no reserved space for any user and Maine companies will be encouraged to take advantage of the infrastructure O'Shaughnessy said. ""There is almost an inevitability that the clients Eimskip will bring into the port will use cold storage"" he said. But ""no customers have guaranteed space or priority space in the facility it's open to everyone.""

A cold storage building is the latest in a series of upgrades transforming the container terminal from an abandoned space Portland used for a snow dump to a hive of activity. More investment is planned in coming years to accommodate more containers allow larger ships and lure shipping companies to port said Burns the port authority director.

""I think bottom line we are open for business. Any carrier that wants to move containers and freight through International Marine Terminal we are open to that"" Burns said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdHVmZi5jby5uei9uYXRpb25hbC9jcmltZS8xMjk2MjgwNjgvYm9kaWVzLWluLXN1aXRjYXNlcy1ob3ctZGlkLXR3by1jaGlsZHJlbi1yZW1haW4tdW5kaXNjb3ZlcmVkLWluLWEtc3RvcmFnZS11bml0LWZvci15ZWFyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How did two children remain undiscovered in unit?,

The hope in TSMC and its 4nm process has somewhat fizzled out at least in the OnePlus 10T. Although the OnePlus phone has a new Cryo Velocity Vapor cooling system and a more efficient SoC in the form of the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 we measured a higher surface temperature of almost 47 ¬∞C than in the 10 Pro.

In addition it is also believed the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra will also utilize Qualcomm‚Äôs 3D Sonic Max fingerprint sensor and feature faster storage.

4 Reviews

It appears Samsung is preparing to stuff its Galaxy S23 Ultra flagship smartphone full of mouth-watering delights that will prevent the Android-smartphone buying public from being tempted by anything running on iOS. We have already reported several times about the 200 MP lens that is expected to land in the S23 Ultra‚Äôs camera equipment and this has now been confirmed in a report by ET News which states:

Samsung Electronics' Mobile Experience (MX) division shared confirmed information with major camera partners that it will install a 200-megapixel camera on the Galaxy S23 recently.

The 200-megapixel camera is only destined for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra model apparently but its use here will also result in the sensor becoming more widespread throughout the Android OEM community. But it takes more than a potentially hit-or-miss 200 MP camera to make a flagship smartphone the new standard so it seems Samsung has also recruited Qualcomm‚Äôs 3D Sonic Max fingerprint sensor for inclusion as well.

The 3D Sonic Max fingerprint reader which will also only be headed to the Galaxy S23 Ultra covers a larger area than other sensors and can read two fingers at the same time thus offering a greater level of security. As pointed out by the source Alvin (@sondesix) it is already in use in phones like the Vivo X80 Pro and iQOO 9 Pro and it includes anti-spoofing technology to guard against those who think they can get round its advanced sensing system.

If those weren't enough exciting prospects for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra yet another leaker has offered up a couple of vague but still interesting rumors about the future flagship which should turn up in the first quarter of 2023. Anthony (@TheGalox_) reckons fans can also expect a ‚Äúnew battery process‚Äù and ‚Äúfaster storage‚Äù in the top-end Galaxy device. Potentially this could mean that the S23 Ultra will sport UFS 4.0 storage which not only should be up to twice as fast as UFS 3.1 but should also be much more power efficient. A denser battery would allow for higher capacities without the need for larger cells.

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck tied the knot in a lavish celebration at the actor's estate in Riceboro Georgia one month after marrying in a Las Vegas chapel and the 53-year-old singer's wedding dress did not disappoint.

Lopez reportedly donned a custom Ralph Lauren gown for the occasion. Per People the head-turning design featured cap sleeves an open-back cutout and a flowing train with ruffle detailing. Lopez topped off her gorgeous bridal moment with a dramatic sheer cathedral-length veil that added a regal feel to her look.

For his part the 50-year-old Gone Girl matched his bride in a white tuxedo jacket worn with black trousers and a classic bowtie.

Ralph Lauren has been the go-to designer for the Marry Me actress with Lopez donning his designs at 2021 Met Gala 2019 CFDA Awards and more.

As for the couple's wedding guests they were dressed in white as well with a source telling ET that ""everyone"" was dressed in white for Affleck and Lopez's big day.

""Everyone is dressed in white with most women in white dresses and gowns and most men in white suits a majority in linen material but the dress code features a wide variety"" the source shared. ""Some men are in white shorts and sneakers and there is a female guest in a white fringe leather jacket and sparkly cowboy hat.""

The big wedding was all about love. Held at Affleck's estate just 45 minutes from Savannah the star-studded affair was officiated by life coach Jay Shetty and attended by the couple's family friends and a slew of celeb guests including Matt Damon Kevin Smith and more.

After the ceremony guests were transported from the main house to the reception via trolley service provided by Old Savannah Tours. Keeping things personal the couple's trolleys included custom JB vinyl was on the side of the rides -- the same inscription on the goodie bags given to each guest.

The wedding was capped off with an extravagant fireworks display and on Sunday guests were treated to a BBQ back at Affleck's 87-acre palatial property before checking out of Savannah's Perry Lane Hotel and making their way home.

Saturday's wedding in Georgia comes just over a month after Lopez and Affleck first tied the knot in Las Vegas. For their first wedding Lopez chose ""a dress from an old movie"" which she said in a video she had ""for so many years and I‚Äôve just been saving it saving it saving it and now I‚Äôm wearing it on my wedding day."" It was later confirmed to ET by a rep for Alexander McQueen that the iconic designer was the mastermind behind the floral jacquard full-skirt gown.

Fans couldn't help but try and debunk the mystery of what dress the movie was from and one Twitter user might have solved the case. ""We found out already where y‚Äôall been?"" Twitter user @Jlostyleandglamour wrote. ""She wore it on the cover of Jersey Girl poster. Dress: Alexander McQueen Floral Jacquard Full-Skirt Gown.""

Of course Jersey Girl is the 2004 romcom which starred Lopez as Gertrude and Affleck as Ollie so it would only make sense that the dress was perfect for the occasion.

The couple obtained a marriage license back in July during an impromptu ceremony in Las Vegas but the wedding festivities are far from being over. The duo continued the celebrations by throwing an exclusive party on Affleck‚Äôs estate in Riceboro Georgia over the weekend. According to TMZ the Georgia estate holds a special meaning for the two: they originally were supposed to tie the knot here after Affleck proposed in 2002 but the couple broke up in 2004. For the momentous occasion Lopez debuted her wedding dress ‚Äî a lavish couture gown by Ralph Lauren ‚Äî that was no less memorable and noteworthy than the two bridal looks she wore in Vegas.

The actor‚Äôs third bridal outfit was a custom turtleneck dress with short flutter sleeves an open back and a skirt with tiered all-over ruching and a dramatic flowing train. According to a statement released by Ralph Lauren over 1000 handkerchiefs and 500 meters of fabric were cut into ruffles to create its voluminous hem. Lopez completed the look with an even longer cascading veil which was held in place by an ivory-hued headband and a pair of pearl earrings plus two pearl rings by MIKIMOTO. As for Affleck he opted for a sleek tailored ensemble that comprised a cream-colored dinner jacket a narrow piqu√© bib shirt and black trousers accessorized with black patent leather shoes and a black bow tie.

On The JLo

Now the plot twist: J.Lo wore two additional gowns also custom-made by Ralph Lauren as she and her guests ‚Äî all dressed in white ‚Äî attended cocktail hour a dinner and a fireworks display after the ceremony. One of them was a dazzling gown embellished with Swarovski crystals and thousands of cascading strings of pearls which she teamed with a pair of crystal-embellished Maisel sandals by Jimmy Choo. The other dress had a mermaid silhouette and featured a Swarovski crystal-embellished keyhole neckline as well as an organza overlay. In case you didn‚Äôt know Ralph Lauren has always been Lopez‚Äôs trusty go-to so it‚Äôs no surprise that she elected the designer to be her designated bridal couturier.

To recap the couple‚Äôs wedding wardrobe also included a traditional ‚Äò60s-inspired wedding dress and an extravagant elaborately embellished off-the-shoulder bridal gown. The former according to J.Lo‚Äôs newsletter came from an old movie while the latter was designed by the Lebanese couturier Zuhair Murad. And now although Lopez and Affleck‚Äôs wedding celebrations have come to an end there‚Äôs no doubt that their matching couple outfits will continue to pop up in pap photos and on social media.

Lopez 53 tapped Ralph Lauren for her three immaculate wedding gowns which all took an incredible amount of work and care.

The ruffled handkerchief dress she wore down the aisle was a reimagination of a turtleneck column sheath according to a press release from the brand. Complete with over 1000 handkerchiefs and 500 meters of fabric the ruffled cap sleeves and voluminous ruffle-tiered train were meant to evoke the romantic sensibility of the fashion house. The mermaid-style silhouette came complete with an open back and sheer 20-foot veil that began at the crown of her head and highlighted her slicked-back updo all the better to catch a glimpse of her Mikimoto pearl drop earrings.

Lopez then switched into a second gown that was completed by 30 artisans across 700 hours and essentially saw her dripping in pearls and Swarovski crystals all of which were strung onto micro-pleated silk tulle fabric and finished with the same earrings and a pair of Jimmy Choo Maisel sandals.

Lopez's final Ralph Lauren look also took a mermaid shape and spoke to her brand of sporty glamour with its sheer organza hood and keyhole neckline adorned with Swarovski crystals around the trim. For this moment Lopez accessorised with $2 million worth of rare diamonds from Samer Halimeh thanks to her 27-carat one-of-a-kind pear-shaped drop flower marquise earrings.

Affleck 50 wore an ivory tuxedo jacket over a crisp white shirt with a button hole flower to match Lopez's intricate mossy green bouquet. His look was finished with black slacks and patent loafers accented by a black bow-tie.

The rest of the wedding party included Lopez's 14-year-old twins Max and Emme and Affleck's kids Violet 16; Seraphina 13; and Samuel 10. The five children were also spotted wearing all-white.

Lopez who also worked with Ralph Lauren on her memorable look for the 2021 Met Gala chose Zuhair Murad for her more intimate ceremony in Las Vegas on 16 July later changing into an Alexander McQueen dress at the chapel which was a costume she had saved from the 2004 romantic comedy ""Jersey Girl"" which she starred in alongside Affleck.

With five separate bridal looks under her belt all selected in collaboration with Lopez's longtime stylists Rob Zangardi and Mariel Haenn Lopez more than impressed on her special day.

The 37-year-old enjoyed a brief period at the pinnacle of the sport before he quickly became a laughing stock after suffering a string of knockout defeats.

Rockhold first made a name for himself in Strikeforce the initial home of some of MMA‚Äôs biggest stars such as Ronda Rousey Daniel Cormier and Nick Diaz.

In 2011 the California native became the company's middleweight champion by beating Ronaldo ‚ÄòJacare‚Äô Souza before defending his belt twice against top opposition in Keith Jardine and Tim Kennedy.

A UFC move followed and despite suffering a shock KO defeat against Vitor Belfort who was infamously jacked up on TRT at the time Rockhold quickly became a force in the middleweight division.

After stopping Costas Phillipou Tim Boetsch Michael Bisping and Lyoto Machida in successive fights Rockhold earned himself a shot at the 185lb title held by Chris Weidman.

The American Kickboxing Academy fighter made it look easy against Weidman who had no answer for his top game before being stopped inside four rounds at UFC 194 in December 2015.

Rockhold appeared to be set for a long reign as champion but this is where his story took a turn. With the fame came outside influences that in hindsight appear to have had a detrimental impact on his fight career.

The 6ft 3in American was signed to a modelling agency and began subsidising his UFC income with work outside of fighting and he ultimately found success with it ‚Äì bagging himself a contract with Ralph Lauren in 2018.

During this time Rockhold enjoyed a brief romance with popstar Demi Lovato. They officially announced their relationship when they attended UFC 205 at New York City's Madison Square Garden before amicably parting ways a few months later.

It quickly became clear that Rockhold‚Äôs new lifestyle did not mesh with being a UFC champion when he was famously knocked out by Michael Bisping who is not known as a power puncher and took the fight on a few days‚Äô notice.

‚ÄòThe Count‚Äô verbally destroyed Rockhold on the mic in the build-up to UFC 199 and ridiculed him in the octagon post-fight something which only added to the humiliating upset loss.

While most fighters who had just lost their belt against someone they were expected to beat would be crying out for a rematch the former UFC middleweight champion was content to continue making money without getting hit in the head.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about making the right move next and making it worth my while I‚Äôm not going to just go out there and put my body on the line when I can get paid that much more in this world [modelling]"" Rockhold said on The MMA Hour in September 2016.

A 15-month layoff followed Rockhold‚Äôs defeat to Bisping and he has never really looked the same since despite managing to get back in the win column against David Branch in his comeback fight.

The first time he faced any real opposition he crumbled and was once again knocked out cold this time by the muscle-bound Cuban wrestler Yoel Romero.

After spending his entire career at middleweight the MMA star attempted something new for his next fight and moved up to light-heavyweight to take on Jan Blachowicz.

The man who went on to win the 205lb title after it was relinquished by Jon Jones put Rockhold to sleep inside two rounds and left the former middleweight king contemplating his future in the sport.

Three years later and after lots of time spent flirting with the idea of retirement Rockhold is finally set to return to fighting when he takes on top middleweight contender Paulo Costa at UFC 278 this weekend.

It‚Äôs certainly a tough return opponent for Rockhold who will surprise many if he is able to stand up to the punching power of ‚ÄòBorrachinha‚Äô as he has one of the best KO records at the weight in recent years.

If victorious the former champion would have a solid case for another title shot and set himself up for the most unlikely redemption story after years of poor form and humiliating defeats."

Streams became his sanctuary offseason fly-fishing his decompression. The technique involves some physics a sliver of science and a bit of artistry. In fact the prerequisites for successfully hooking cutthroat trout in the western Wyoming stretch of the Snake River provide a metaphor for Gabbert‚Äôs professional life.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs patience‚Äù Gabbert said after a recent practice at AdventHealth Training Center. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs more finesse. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre bottom-fishing or trolling it‚Äôs all placement presentation so there‚Äôs a lot of work that kind of leads up to it all.‚Äù

Entering his fourth season in Tampa Bay Gabbert hasn‚Äôt budged from the spot he assumed upon his arrival: One heartbeat ‚Äî or change of heart in the case of Tom Brady ‚Äî from taking the wheel of the Bucs offense.

While patience hasn‚Äôt necessarily fostered tranquility it has borne stability. Saddled with a different offensive coordinator each of his first nine NFL seasons Gabbert has spent nearly a half-decade in his current system.

During Brady‚Äôs extended training-camp absence for what has been described as ‚Äúpersonal reasons‚Äù Gabbert has been the Bucs‚Äô starter by default both in the preseason opener against the Dolphins and in joint practices with the Dolphins and Titans.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been great for him mentally‚Äù Bucs coach Todd Bowles said Thursday at the end of the second joint workout with Tennessee.

‚ÄúThe plays might not be there all the time but the mental reps and what he‚Äôs getting and making the right play is very important not just making a ‚Äòwow‚Äô play. He‚Äôs been making the right plays so it‚Äôs been great to have him there.‚Äù

Before signing with the Bucs in March 2019 Gabbert spent the 2017 season in Arizona where current Bucs coordinator Byron Leftwich was his position coach and current Tampa Bay run-game coordinator Harold Goodwin served as head coach Bruce Arians‚Äô coordinator.

Before that one has to backpedal to Gabbert‚Äôs college career at Missouri (2008-2010) where he threw for nearly 7000 yards and led the Tigers to a pair of bowl games to find a stretch where he had the same coach or coordinator in back-to-back seasons.

‚ÄúYou look back in 2017 it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre studying every night learning the formations just trying to keep your head above the water‚Äù said Gabbert who has attempted 27 regular-season passes in a Bucs uniform.

‚ÄúAnd now you have more freedom. You know exactly what you want to get to how to get to it where are we supposed to be when they‚Äôre supposed to be there. You can really take that next step in not only your own maturation process of playing football but helping the young guys. That‚Äôs what I enjoy the most really today.‚Äù

Learning the languages

Know this: Had Brady remained retired Gabbert almost certainly would‚Äôve inherited his job and Arians still would be coaching him if for nothing more than to prove Gabbert‚Äôs competence as a starter and to spite the rest of the league.

For years now Arians has sworn by the guy fans once enjoyed swearing at. At 32 Gabbert still brandishes the velocity befitting a No. 10 overall draft pick (in 2011). And during this haphazard NFL journey he has acquired a degree of moxie and locker-room respect.

‚ÄúBlaine‚Äôs my guy‚Äù Bucs second-year receiver Jaelon Darden said. ‚ÄúHe kind of took me under his wing and helped me with the offense for sure. My first year here he was definitely getting me in the right spot because I was all over the place but it‚Äôs definitely been a blessing learning from him because he‚Äôs a great quarterback as well.‚Äù

All of which may prove that spin rate is rendered moot without stability and that not even generational quarterbacks can elevate franchises that whiff on personnel decisions and go through coaches like sneakers. Until arriving in Tampa Gabbert annually was learning new systems on the fly if not on the run.

‚ÄúI always try and equate it to just learning a new language every year‚Äù said Gabbert 13-35 in his career as an NFL starter. ‚ÄúAnd then you have to speak that language when 11 guys on defense are running after you full-speed. So things aren‚Äôt necessarily clicking as fast as they should be. It‚Äôs not truly muscle memory when you‚Äôre always still trying to just learn.‚Äù

His head coaches have ranged from Jim Harbaugh (49ers 2014) to Jim Tomsula (49ers 2015). His collection of coordinators has included Dirk Koetter (Jaguars 2011) Geep Chryst (49ers 2015) and Matt LaFleur (Titans 2018). In one six-season span Gabbert played on five teams that lost at least 10 games.

‚ÄúPeople may not like the overall record but Blaine had eight head coaches and eight coordinators his first eight years‚Äù Arians said earlier this year. ‚ÄúHe beat Jacksonville their best year (in 2017 while with the Cardinals) and beat Tennessee their big year for us in Arizona (also in 2017). And he‚Äôs been in the system now.‚Äù

32 going on 25

That newfound stability has brought not only peace but preservation. The flip side to existing in Brady‚Äôs shadow: Minimal wear on the body. And like many inside AdventHealth Training Center Gabbert has embraced the TB12 method and its emphasis on hydration pliability and nutrition among other Brady tenets.

Moreover he just became a dad. His wife Bekah a former Missouri basketball player gave birth to the couple‚Äôs first child ‚Äî daughter Leyton ‚Äî earlier this summer.

‚ÄúReally the last few years I‚Äôve taken kind of the whole TB12 process to heart‚Äù said Gabbert who enters 2022 with a 56.3-percent career completion rate with 50 touchdowns and 47 picks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm big I‚Äôm strong I‚Äôm fast but there was always something missing. I need to be more flexible more durable so you don‚Äôt have the muscle strains.

‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs different everybody‚Äôs body responds to different treatments or different trainings differently but for me personally that‚Äôs what‚Äôs worked for me the best and I feel better than I did at 25. And I‚Äôm 32.‚Äù

Now it‚Äôs just a matter of exercising that patience fostered in those frigid streams. Time technique and placement could yield one more whopper of an opportunity perhaps in Tampa.

And perhaps sooner rather than later.

‚ÄúWe have such a great group of guys great coaching staff great front office‚Äù Gabbert said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot of fun to come to work. I don‚Äôt even call it work it‚Äôs just hanging out with the guys every day and hopefully I can stay here a lot longer.‚Äù

White appeared alongside Gronkowski -- along with the recently retired tight end's brothers and father -- during the UFC with the Gronks broadcast on ESPN and ESPN+ for UFC 278 on Saturday (August 20) night and was coaxed by the four-time Super Bowl champion to tell the story of the potential deal which White claimed was squashed by former Raiders head coach Jon Gruden.

""I worked to put that deal together for Brady and Gronk to come to the Raiders"" White said via ESPN. ""It was almost a done deal. And at the last minute Gruden blew the deal up and said that he didn't want him and all hell broke loose man. It was crazy.

""And Brady was already looking at houses. It wasn't said yet that Gronk was going to be coming. So Las Vegas would have had Brady and Gronk the year that the Bucs won the Super Bowl except Gruden blew the deal up.""

Gruden resigned as the Raiders' head coach in October 2021 shortly after a New York Times report revealed that the coach used misogynistic and anti-gay language in numerous emails during a seven-year span beginning in 2011.

ESPN Senior NFL Insider Adam Schefter reported that the Raiders planned to pursue Brady ahead of his free agency during the 2020 offseason but the seven-time Super Bowl champion instead signed with the Buccaneers.

Gronkowski had previously retired in 2019 following his last Super Bowl victory as a member of the Patriots before coming out of retirement the following offseason and rejoining Brady -- his teammate for his entire career -- after being traded to the Buccaneers days later.

White claimed that the Raiders would've made a similar move to acquire Gronkowski had they signed Brady instead of the Buccaneers.

""I'm glad it did not go through"" Gronkowski said via ESPN. ""It all worked out for the best man. I'm glad we went to Tampa man. It just worked out. I love that place.""

Brady and Gronkowski won their fourth Super Bowl as teammates during their first season with the Buccaneers defeating the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 in Super Bowl LV at Raymond James Stadium to become the first NFL franchise to win a Super Bowl at their home stadium.

Brady initially announced his retirement this past offseason only to announce his return for his 23rd season weeks later.

The seven-time Super Bowl champion has however been away from the Bucs since August 11 with head coach Todd Bowles describing the situation as Brady tending to ""personal things"" and not providing a confirmed return date.

Brady is the NFL's all-time passing leader for yards (84520) and touchdowns (624) as well as quarterback wins (243) among numerous other records.

The San Mateo native spent his first 20 seasons with the New England Patriots leading the franchise to an NFL record six Super Bowl championships (tied with the Steelers) before joining the Buccaneers as a free agent in March 2020 which resulted in Tampa Bay winning its second Super Bowl in franchise history becoming the first NFL team to win a Super Bowl in its home stadium in February 2021.

Gronkowski ranks third all-time among NFL tight ends in career touchdown receptions (92) fifth in receiving yards (9286) and 10th in receptions (621).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZW5uZXNzZWFuLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvbmZsL3RpdGFucy8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL3Rlbm5lc3NlZS10aXRhbnMtdnMtYnVjY2FuZWVycy1zY29yZS1wcmVzZWFzb24tZ2FtZS11cGRhdGVzLXRhbXBhLWJheS8xMDM1NTEyNzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tennessee Titans vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Live game updates final score in NFL preseason,"The Tennessee Titans host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in their second preseason game Saturday at Nissan Stadium (6 p.m. / NFL Network and WKRN in Nashville).

The matchup will conclude a long week between the teams which had joint practices Wednesday and Thursday at Saint Thomas Sports Park. It marked the second straight year of practices between the clubs.

Coach Mike Vrabel said Thursday he hadn't made a decision on who will start at quarterback though he acknowledged that rookie Malik Willis has been eating into Logan Woodside's reps in recent practices for development purposes.

A third-round pick Willis started in the Titans' preseason-opening loss to the Ravens completing 6-of-11 passes for 107 yards and rushing five times for 38 yards and a touchdown.

""We've had conversations with Logan about his opportunity to compete but I also feel like we have to see how quickly we can bring Malik along"" Vrabel said.

Tennessee Titans vs. Buccaneers score live updates

Fourth quarter

FINAL: Titans 13 Bucs 3

10:32 left: Ryan Stonehouse drops the snap in punt formation but outraces the Bucs' frontline for a first down. Good instincts for the UDFA punter I guess?

11:33 left: Treylon Burks and Jalen McKenzie each called for holding on a solid run by Julius Chestnut on a third down carry. Meanwhile Reggie Roberson has four catches for 47 yards tonight.

14:54 left: Logan Woodside is intercepted. Deep ball intended for Treylon Burks. Not the best preseason for the Titans' backup QB.

Third quarter

1:27 left in the third quarter: Treylon Burks has his first catch of the preseason on a short route along the right sideline.

Titans 13 Bucs 3 with 2:20 left in the third: Ryan Succop is good from 52 yards out.

3:40 left in the third quarter: Ke'Shawn Vaughn has had a good quarter carrying 8 times for 50 yards. The cart is out for former Titans offensive lineman Aaron Stinnie who has played a lot for the Bucs tonight. Lower-body injury.

7:34 left in the third quarter: Ola Adeniyi strips Kyle Trask on third down. Trask recovers but it's a 21-yard loss and a sack credited to Adeniyi. Logan Woodside coming into the game at QB for Tennessee.

9 minutes left in the third quarter: Kyle Trask just made an excellent throw on the move for 35 yards. Had room to step up in the pocket.

10:41 left in the third quarter: Ke'Shawn Vaughn in the game for Tampa Bay trying to battle for a reserve running back role. The former Vandy star bursts through the middle for 17 yards.

12:50 left in the third quarter: Ryan Stonehouse punts the ball out the back of the end zone. The UDFA punter has a big-time leg. Note on the previous drive: Mason Kinsey had a drop and Malik Willis scrambled himself into a sack instead of throwing the ball away on third down.

Start of quarter: Malik Willis remains in the game to start the third quarter.

Second quarter

26 seconds left in the first half: Malik Willis cashes in on the turnover doing well inside the pocket to find Chig Okwonkwo for a 6-yard touchdown pass. Some juice on that throw too. Titans lead 13-0.

1:44 left in the first half: A non-Titans tweet: Kyle Trask has not improved through two preseasons with the Bucs. Still lacks NFL-level poise and pocket presence for a QB.

On cue Trask throws an interception under pressure.

4:14 left in the first half: Randy Bullock is good from 49 yards. Titans lead 6-0. Tennessee's offensive line including potential starters Dillon Radunz and Nicholas Petit-Frere has struggled in pass protection.

5:11 left in the first half: Recent addition Lonnie Johnson forces a fumble that is recovered by Rashad Weaver. Johnson has made a couple good plays in the first half.

5:58 left in the first half: Willis has to throw the ball away while scrambling on third down. Randy Bullock's 32-yard field goal is good. Points! Titans lead 3-0.

8:38 left in the first half: Malik Willis scrambles for 26 yards. Looked very comfortable in the pocket against the blitz and made a smooth run down the right sideline.

9:22 left in the first half: That's at least two run-option carries for Malik Willis tonight. He has four total carries so far.

12:26 left in the first half: There's the Malik Willis sidearm throw again. He finds Dez Fitzpatrick for a first down reception.

13:45 left in the first half: Caleb Farley playing in the second quarter and just made a good play on the ball to force a third-down incompletion.

14:49 left in the first half: Malik Willis throws a ball off target for an open Chig Okwonkwo on 4th down. Neither team's reserve QBs are comfortable just yet.

First quarter

2:27 left in the first quarter: Kyle Philips has a future at punt returner. 35-yard return his second good return of the quarter. (And then he was called for a false start on the next play.)

4:02 left in the first quarter: Titans first-team offensive line started the game but the OL are rotating through after three possessions. Taylor Lewan sat out that drive and is likely done for the day.

5:28 left in the first quarter: Second-year edge rusher Rashad Weaver earns a sack. Titans defense started the game with a mix of starters including Bud Dupree and Kristian Fulton and backups.

7:36 left in the first quarter: Titans defense gets a stop on fourth down against Bucs QB Blaine Gabbert but go three-and-out as Willis is sacked on second down. Still scoreless.

11:06 left in the first quarter: Malik Willis starts the first drive of his second NFL preseason game with a good throw to Nick Westbrook-Ikhine and finishes it with a 4-yard loss on a run on fourth down. Good and not-so-good from the rookie.

Nvidia has long been the dominant player in the graphics card market but the company has from time to time been put under serious pressure by its main rival AMD which has launched several of its own iconic GPUs. Those only set Nvidia up for a major comeback however and sometimes that led to a real game-changing card.

It was hard to choose which Nvidia GPUs were truly worthy of being called the best of all time but I‚Äôve narrowed down the list to six cards that were truly important and made history.

GeForce 256

The very first

Although Nvidia often claims the GeForce 256 was the world‚Äôs first GPU that‚Äôs only true if Nvidia is the only company that gets to define what a GPU is. Before GeForce there were the RIVA series of graphics cards and there were other companies making their own competing graphics cards then too. What Nvidia really invented was the marketing of graphics cards as GPUs because in 1999 when the 256 came out terms like graphics card and graphics chipset were more common.

Nvidia is right that the 256 was important however. Before the 256 the CPU played a very important role in rendering graphics to the point where the CPU was directly completing steps in rendering a 3D environment. However CPUs were not very efficient at doing this which is where the 256 came in with hardware transforming and lighting offloading the two most CPU intensive parts of rendering onto the GPU. This is one of the primary reasons why Nvidia claims this is the first GPU.

As a product the GeForce 256 wasn‚Äôt exactly legendary: Anandtech wasn‚Äôt super impressed by its price for the performance at the time of its release. Part of the problem was the 256‚Äôs memory which was single data rate or SDR. Due to other advances SDR was becoming insufficient for GPUs of this performance level. A faster dual data rate or DDR (the same DDR as in DDR5) launched just before the end of 1999 which finally met Anandtech‚Äôs expectations for performance but the increased price tag of the DDR version was hard to swallow.

The GeForce 256 first of its name is certainly historical but not because it was an amazing product. The 256 is important because it inaugurated the modern era of GPUs. The graphics card market wasn‚Äôt always a duopoly; back in the 90s there were multiple companies competing against each other with Nvidia being just one of them. Soon after the GeForce 256 launched most of Nvidia‚Äôs rivals exited the market. 3dfx‚Äôs Voodoo 5 GPUs were uncompetitive and before it went bankrupt many of its technologies were bought by Nvidia; Matrox simply quit gaming GPUs altogether to focus on professional graphics.

By the end of 2000 the only other graphics company in town was ATI. When AMD acquired ATI in 2006 it brought about the modern Nvidia and AMD rivalry we all know today.

GeForce 8800 GTX

A monumental leap forward

After the GeForce 256 Nvidia and ATI attempted to best the other with newer GPUs with higher performance. In 2002 however ATI threw down the gauntlet by launching its Radeon 9000 series and at a die size of 200mm squared the flagship Radeon 9800 XT was easily the largest GPU ever. Nvidia‚Äôs flagship GeForce4 Ti 4600 at 100mm had no hope of beating even the midrange 9700 Pro which inflicted a crushing defeat on Nvidia. Making a GPU was no longer just about the architecture the memory or the drivers; in order to win Nvidia would need to make big GPUs like ATI.

For the next four years the size of flagship GPUs continued to increase and by 2005 both companies had launched a GPU that was around 300mm. Although Nvidia had regained the upper hand during this time ATI was never far behind and its Radeon X1000 series was fairly competitive. A GPU sized at 300mm was far from the limit of what Nvidia could do however. In 2006 Nvidia released its GeForce 8 series led by the flagship 8800 GTX. Its GPU codenamed G80 was nearly 500mm and its transistor count was almost three times higher than the last GeForce flagship.

The 8800 GTX did to ATI what the Radeon 9700 Pro and the rest of the 9000 series did to Nvidia with Anandtech describing the moment as ‚Äú9700 Pro-like.‚Äù A single 8800 GTX was almost twice as fast as ATI‚Äôs top-end X1950 XTX not to mention much more efficient. At $599 the 8800 GTX was more expensive than its predecessors but its high level of performance and DirectX 10 support made up for it.

But this was mostly the end of the big GPU arms race that had characterized the early 2000s for two main reasons. Firstly 500mm was getting pretty close to the limit of how large a GPU could be and even today 500mm is relatively big for a processor. Even if Nvidia wanted to making a bigger GPU just wasn‚Äôt feasible. Secondly ATI wasn‚Äôt working on its own 500mm GPU anyway so Nvidia wasn‚Äôt in a rush to get an even bigger GPU to market. Nvidia had basically won the arms race by outspending ATI.

That year also saw the acquisition of ATI by AMD which was finalized just before the 8800 GTX launched. Although ATI now had the backing of AMD it really seemed like Nvidia had such a massive lead that Radeon wouldn‚Äôt challenge GeForce for a long time perhaps never again.

GeForce GTX 680

Beating AMD at its own game

Nvidia‚Äôs next landmark release came in 2008 when it launched the GTX 200 series starting with the GTX 280 and GTX 260. At nearly 600mm squared the 280 was a worthy monstrous successor to the 8800 GTX. Meanwhile AMD and ATI signaled that they would no longer be launching high-end GPUs with big dies in order to compete rather focusing on making smaller GPUs in a gambit known as the small die strategy. In its review Anandtech said ‚ÄúNvidia will be left all alone with top performance for the foreseeable future.‚Äù As it turned out the next four years were pretty rough for Nvidia.

Starting with the HD 4000 series in 2008 AMD assaulted Nvidia with small GPUs that had high value and almost flagship levels of performance and that dynamic was maintained throughout the next few generations. Nvidia‚Äôs GTX 280 wasn‚Äôt cost effective enough then the GTX 400 series was delayed and the 500 series was too hot and power hungry.

One of Nvidia‚Äôs traditional weaknesses was its disadvantage when it came to process the way processors are manufactured. Nvidia was usually behind AMD but it had finally caught up by using the 40nm node for the 400 series. AMD however wanted to regain the process lead quickly and decided its next generation would be on the new 28nm node and Nvidia decided to follow suit.

AMD won the race to 28nm with its HD 7000 series with its flagship HD 7970 putting AMD back in first place for performance. However the GTX 680 launched just two months later and not only did it beat the 7970 in performance but also power efficiency and even die size. As Anandtech put it Nvidia had ‚Äúlanded the technical trifecta‚Äù and that completely flipped the tables on AMD. AMD did reclaim the performance crown yet again by launching the HD 7970 GHz Edition later in 2012 (notable for being the first 1GHz GPU) but having the lead in efficiency and performance per millimeter was a good sign for Nvidia.

The back and forth battle between Nvidia and AMD was pretty exciting after how disappointing the GTX 400 and 500 series had been and while the 680 wasn‚Äôt an 8800 GTX it signaled Nvidia‚Äôs return to being truly competitive against AMD. Perhaps most importantly Nvidia was no longer weighed down by its traditional process disadvantage and that would eventually pay off in a big way.

GeForce GTX 980

Nvidia‚Äôs dominance begins

Nvidia found itself in a very good spot with the GTX 600 series and it was because of TSMC‚Äôs 28nm process. Under normal circumstances AMD would have simply gone to TSMC‚Äôs next process in order to regain its traditional advantage but this was no longer an option. TSMC and all other foundries in the world (except for Intel) had an extraordinary amount of difficulty progressing beyond the 28nm node. New technologies were needed in order to progress further which meant Nvidia didn‚Äôt have to worry about AMD regaining the process lead any time soon.

Following a few years of back and forth and AMD floundering with limited funds Nvidia launched the GTX 900 series in 2014 inaugurated by the GTX 980. Based on the new Maxwell architecture it was an incredible improvement over the GTX 600 and 700 series despite being on the same node. The 980 was between 30% and 40% faster than the 780 while consuming less power and it was even a smidge faster than the top-end 780 Ti. Of course the 980 also beat the R9 290X once again landing the trifecta of performance power efficiency and die size. In its review Anandtech said the 980 came ‚Äúvery very close to doing to the Radeon 290X what the GTX 680 did to Radeon HD 7970.‚Äù

AMD was incapable of responding. It didn‚Äôt have a next-generation GPU ready to launch in 2014. In fact AMD wasn‚Äôt even working on a complete lineup of brand-new GPUs to even the score with Nvidia. AMD instead was planning on rebranding the Radeon 200 series as the Radeon 300 series and would develop one new GPU to serve as the flagship. All of these GPUs were to launch in mid 2015 giving the entire GPU market to Nvidia for nearly a full year. Of course Nvidia wanted to pull the rug right from under AMD and prepared a brand-new flagship.

Launching in mid 2015 the GTX 980 Ti was about 30% faster than the GTX 980 thanks to its significantly higher power consumption and larger die size at just over 600mm squared. It beat AMD‚Äôs brand-new R9 Fury X a month before it even launched. Although the Fury X wasn‚Äôt bad it had lower performance than the 980 Ti higher power consumption and much less VRAM. It was a demonstration of how far ahead Nvidia was with the 900 series; while AMD was hastily trying to get the Fury X out the door Nvidia could have launched the 980 Ti any time it wanted.

Anandtech put it pretty well: ‚ÄúThe fact that they get so close only to be outmaneuvered by Nvidia once again makes the current situation all the more painful; it‚Äôs one thing to lose to Nvidia by feet but to lose by inches only reminds you of just how close they got how they almost upset Nvidia.‚Äù

Nvidia was basically a year ahead of AMD technologically and while what they had done with the GTX 900 series was impressive it was also a bit depressing. People wanted to see Nvidia and AMD duke it out like they had done in 2012 and 2013 but it started to look like that was all in the past. Nvidia‚Äôs next GPU would certainly reaffirm that feeling.

GeForce GTX 1080

The GPU with no competition but itself

In 2015 TSMC had finally completed the 16nm process which could achieve 40% higher clock speeds than 28nm at the same power or half the power of 28nm at similar clock speeds. However Nvidia planned to move to 16nm in 2016 when the node was more mature. Meanwhile AMD had absolutely no plans to utilize TSMC‚Äôs 16nm but instead moved to launch new GPUs and CPUs on GlobalFoundries‚Äôs 14nm process. But don‚Äôt be fooled by the names: TSMC‚Äôs 16nm was and is better than GlobalFoundries‚Äôs 14nm. After 28nm nomenclature for processes became based in marketing rather than scientific measurements. This meant that for the first time in modern GPU history Nvidia had the process advantage against AMD.

The GTX 10-series launched in mid-2016 based on the new Pascal architecture and TSMC‚Äôs 16nm node. Pascal wasn‚Äôt actually very different from Maxwell but the jump from 28nm to 16nm was massive like Intel going from 14nm on Skylake to 10nm on Alder Lake. The GTX 1080 was the new flagship and it‚Äôs hard to overstate how fast it was. The GTX 980 was a little faster than the GTX 780 Ti when it came out. By contrast the GTX 1080 was over 30% faster than the GTX 980 Ti and for $50 less too. The die size of the 1080 was also extremely impressive at just over 300mm squared nearly half the size of the 980 Ti.

With the 1080 and the rest of the 10-series lineup Nvidia effectively took the entire desktop GPU market for itself. AMD‚Äôs 300 series and the Fury X were simply no match. At the midrange AMD launched the RX 400 series but these were just three low to mid-range GPUs that were a throwback to the small die strategy minus the part where Nvidia‚Äôs flagship was in striking distance like with the GTX 280 and the HD 4870. In fact the 1080 was nearly twice as fast as the RX 480. The only GPU AMD could really beat was the mid-range GTX 1060 as the slightly cut down GTX 1070 was just a little too fast to lose to the Fury X.

AMD did eventually launch new high-end GPUs in the form of RX Vega a full year after the 1080 came out. With much higher power consumption and the same selling price the flagship RX Vega 64 beat the GTX 1080 by a hair but wasn‚Äôt very competitive. However the GTX 1080 was no longer Nvidia‚Äôs flagship; with relatively small die size and a full year to prepare Nvidia launched a brand-new flagship a whole three months before RX Vega even launched; it was a repeat of the 980 Ti. The new GTX 1080 Ti was even faster than the GTX 1080 delivering yet another 30% improvement to performance. As Anandtech put it the 1080 Ti ‚Äúfurther solidifie[d] Nvidia‚Äôs dominance of the high-end video card market.‚Äù

AMD‚Äôs failure to deliver a truly competitive high-end GPU meant that the 1080‚Äôs only real competition was Nvidia‚Äôs own GTX 1080 Ti. With the 1080 and the 1080 Ti Nvidia achieved what is perhaps the most complete victory we‚Äôve seen so far in modern GPU history. Over the past 4 years Nvidia kept increasing its technological advantage over AMD and it was hard to see how Nvidia could ever lose.

GeForce RTX 3080

Correcting course

After such a long and incredible streak of wins perhaps it was inevitable that Nvidia would succumb to hubris and lose sight of what made Nvidia‚Äôs great GPUs so great. Nvidia did not follow up the GTX 10 series with yet another GPU with a stunning increase in performance but with the infamous RTX 20 series. Perhaps in a move to cut AMD out of the GPU market Nvidia focused on introducing hardware accelerated ray tracing and A.I. upscaling instead of delivering better performance in general. If successful Nvidia could make AMD GPUs irrelevant until the company finally made Radeon GPUs with built-in ray tracing.

RTX 20-series was a bit of a flop. When the RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti launched in late 2018 there weren‚Äôt even any games that supported ray tracing or deep learning super sampling (DLSS). But Nvidia priced RTX 20-series cards as if those features made all the difference. At $699 the 2080 had a nonsensical price and the 2080 Ti‚Äôs $1199 price tag was even more insane. Nvidia wasn‚Äôt even competing with itself anymore.

The performance improvement in existing titles was extremely disappointing too; the RTX 2080 was only 11% faster than the GTX 1080 though at least the RTX 2080 Ti was around 30% faster than the GTX 1080 Ti.

The next two years were a course correction for Nvidia. The threat from AMD was starting to become pretty serious; the company had finally regained the process advantage by moving to TSMC‚Äôs 7nm and the company launched the RX 5700 XT in mid-2019. Nvidia was able to head it off once again by launching new GPUs this time the RTX 20 Super series with a focus on value but the 5700 XT must have worried Nvidia. The RTX 2080 Ti was three times as large yet was only 50% faster meaning AMD was achieving much higher performance per millimeter. If AMD made a larger GPU it could be difficult to beat.

Both Nvidia and AMD planned for a big showdown in 2020. Nvidia recognized AMD‚Äôs potential and pulled out all the stops: the new 8nm process from Samsung the new Ampere architecture and an emphasis on big GPUs. AMD meanwhile stayed on TSMC‚Äôs 7nm process but introduced the new RDNA 2 architecture and would also be launching a big GPU its first since RX Vega in 2017. The last time both companies launched brand-new flagships within the same year was 2013 nearly a decade ago. Though the pandemic threatened to ruin the plans of both companies neither company was willing to delay the next generation and launched as planned.

Nvidia fired first with the RTX 30-series led by the flagship RTX 3090 but most of the focus was on the RTX 3080 since at $699 it was far more affordable than the $1499 3090. Instead of being a repeat of the RTX 20-series the 3080 delivered a sizeable 30% bump in performance at 4K over the RTX 2080 Ti though the power consumption was a little high. At lower resolutions the performance gain of the 3080 was somewhat less but since the 3080 was very capable at 4K it was easy to overlook this. The 3080 also benefitted from a wider variety of games supporting ray tracing and DLSS giving value to having an Nvidia GPU with those features.

Of course this wouldn‚Äôt matter if the 3080 and the rest of the RTX 30-series couldn‚Äôt stand up to AMD‚Äôs new RX 6000 series which launched two months later. At $649 the RX 6800 XT was AMD‚Äôs answer to the RTX 3080. With nearly identical performance in most games and at most resolutions the battle between the 3080 and the 6800 XT was reminiscent of the GTX 680 and the HD 7970. Each company had its advantages and disadvantages with AMD leading in power efficiency and performance while Nvidia had better performance in ray tracing and support for other features like A.I. upscaling.

The excitement over a new episode in the GPU war quickly died out though because it quickly came apparent that nobody could buy RTX 30 or RX 6000 or even any GPUs at all. The pandemic had seriously reduced supply while crypto increased demand and scalpers snatched up as many GPUs as they could. At the time of writing the shortage has mostly ended but most Nvidia GPUs are still selling for usually $100 or more over MSRP. Thankfully higher-end GPUs like the RTX 3080 can be found closer to MSRP than lower-end 30 series cards which keeps the 3080 a viable option.

On the whole the RTX 3080 was a much-needed correction from Nvidia. Although the 3080 has marked the end of Nvidia‚Äôs near total domination of the desktop GPU market it‚Äôs hard not to give the company credit for not losing to AMD. After all the RX 6000 series is on a much better process and AMD has been extremely aggressive these past few years. And besides it‚Äôs good to finally see a close race between Nvidia and AMD where both sides are trying really hard to win.

So what‚Äôs next?

Unlike AMD Nvidia always keeps its cards close to its chest and rarely ever reveals information on upcoming products. We can be pretty confident the upcoming RTX 40 series will launch sometime this year but everything else is uncertain. One of the more interesting rumors is that Nvidia will utilize TSMC‚Äôs 5nm for RTX 40 GPUs and if this is true then that means Nvidia will have parity with AMD once again.

But I think that as long as RTX 40 isn‚Äôt another RTX 20 and provides more low-end and mid-range options than RTX 30 Nvidia should have a good enough product next generation. I would really like for it to be so good that it makes the list of best Nvidia GPUs of all time but we‚Äôll have to wait and see.

AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT: Two minute review

AMD should have led with the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT.

After a year and a half since AMD launched this generation's RDNA 2 graphics cards and almost two years after Nvidia launched its first consumer Ampere cards AMD has come out with a card that epitomizes everything AMD is known and respected for. It's just a shame that it's last call on this generation of graphics cards and the RX 6950 XT likely won't get the love it really deserved.

The RX 6950 XT is the first graphics card from Team Red to pose an actually serious challenge to the Nvidia RTX 3090's gaming performance and even though some inconsistencies inevitably hold it back from going a full twelve rounds against Nvidia's best it's the kind of fighter that you find yourself cheering for anyway.

What is so appealing about the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT is that it is simply one of the best graphics cards ‚Äì if not the best ‚Äì in the premium tier when measuring its price to its performance. AMD has always been known for offering great cards at a great price and what's amazing about the RX 6950 XT is that AMD manages to bring that same philosophy into the premium tier of the graphics card market.

Cards at this level are all about performance and they normally have prices to match but the RX 6950 XT shows that even the most exclusive clubs can have an item or two on the value menu.

As such it is a great option for gamers out there who can afford a premium card but aren't actually giant human-shaped walking piles of money ‚Äì it least it would be if RDNA 3 wasn't right around the corner. AMD's next-gen graphics cards are likely to make some major advances in terms of ray tracing and hardware-assisted upscaling tech that should blow the current generation of AMD cards out of the water so buying anything premium from this generation right now is iffy at best.

It's entirely possible that an AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT could have comparable performance to the RX 6950 XT and it will likely be cheaper so the potential value of this card is somewhat wasted with so late an entry into the market. Again it's a shame because this card has a lot going for it at least on the gaming front.

If you're not a gamer though there really isn't a whole lot for you here. While the RX 6950 XT is the best AMD graphics card to hit the market its creative workload performance still lags considerably behind the best Nvidia GeForce graphics cards and without Tensor cores the RX 6950 XT simply isn't up for the task of intense machine learning models and other similar research work that makes Nvidia RTX cards so prized.

All that said this was always meant to be a gamer's graphics card and for the price you're paying the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT might be that rare premium PC component that manages to deliver outstanding value in a market where such an idea is almost entirely alien. But if you can wait until RDNA 3 launches it might be worth seeing what AMD's next-gen cards offer before plopping down a lot of money on a card that could be quickly overshadowed before the year is out.

AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT: Price and availability

How much is it? MSRP listed at $1099 (about ¬£880 AU$1580) $1299 as reviewed

MSRP listed at $1099 (about ¬£880 AU$1580) $1299 as reviewed When is it out? It is available now

It is available now Where can you get it? You can buy in the US UK and Australia

The AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT we reviewed is the Gigabyte RX 6950 XT Gaming OC version rather than an AMD reference card so it's a bit more expensive than AMD's $1099 (about ¬£880 AU$1580) MSRP.

The Gigabyte RX 6950 XT Gaming OC card retails for $1299 (about ¬£1039 / AU$1870) which is still $200 (about ¬£160 / AU$290) cheaper than Nvidia's RTX 3090 Founders Edition card and $300 (about ¬£240 / AU$430) cheaper than the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3090 Gaming OC card.

AMD's MSRP for the RX 6950 XT is also $100 (about ¬£80 / AU$145) less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti even though the 3080 Ti is a much more comparable card to the RX 6950 XT by the numbers in most cases.

It's also worth noting that AMD cards are generally not as heavily bought for mining or by profiteers on resale sites so they've generally seen better availability than RTX 30-series cards and so might be easier to find in most cases.

AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT: Design and chipset

(Image credit: Future)

On-board Dual BIOS switch for OC and Silent modes

16.7 million RGB color options for Gigabyte logo on card

Faster GPU and memory clocks

The Gigabyte RX 6950 XT Gaming OC card we reviewed is a pretty good looking card that you won't be embarassed to show off in your build and it sure as hell looks more attractive than the AMD reference card design for the RDNA 2 cards.

Sporting a silver and dark gray colorway the Gigabyte card features a three-alternating-fan cooling solution where the middle fan spins counterwise to the two fans on either side of it. This is designed to make for less turbulent air flow through the card to help keep things cool and it does appear to take 5¬∞C to 10¬∞C off the max temperature in our tests compared to the RTX 3090 Ti and RTX 3080. But that isn't so much of a difference that other conditions might have played a larger role than a counterclockwise spinning fan blade. If nothing else it looks cool if you stop to notice it at any point.

Gigabyte AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT Gaming OC key specs GPU: Navi21

Stream Processors: 5120

Ray Accelerators: 80

Power Draw (TGP): 335W

Base Clock: 1925 MHz

Boost Clock: 2324 MHz

VRAM: 16GB GDDR6

Memory Speed: 1800MHz

Memory Bus: 256-bit

Memory Bandwith: 576.0 GB/s

Card Interface: PCIe 4.0

Outputs: 2 x HDMI 2.1 2 x DisplayPort 1.4a

Power Connector: 3 x 8-pin

Recommended PSU: 850W

Chances are you won't really see it though but that's ok because Gigabyte's Aorus Fusion 2.0 will let you program 16.7 million different color options into the Gigabyte logo along the visible edge including several different patterns like color wave color pulse and more that adds some additional RGB flair to your build.

There is also a attractive looking backplate to the card that doesn't just protect the sensitive connections on the PCB but the brushed metal design has an almost space-station-y feel to it that is an excellent complement to a Gigabyte Aorus motherboard.

Along the edge of that backplate you'll also find a dual BIOS switch that can flip the card from OC to Silent mode with the former pushing performance while the latter is designed for quieter operation.

Finally this card needs a lot of power but it blessedly doesn't come with Nvidia's funky new connectors that require an adapter to convert from your standard 8-pin to a 12-pin one. The RX 6950 XT will still require three available 8-pin connectors though.

On the inside the Gigabyte RX 6950 XT is powered by the same Navi21 GPU found in the Radeon RX 6900 XT though with some faster clock speeds for both the GPU and the 16GB of GDDR6 memory.

The RX 6900 XT for example features a base clock of 1825 MHz and a boost of 2250 MHz compared to the RX 6950 XT's 1925 MHz and 2324 MHz respectively which is a bit over 3% to 5% faster.

In terms of memory the VRAM on the RX 6950 XT is also a bit faster at 2250MHz compared to the RX 6900 XT's 2000MHz. With the amount of VRAM and the same 256-bit memory bus this extra speed might not seem like a lot but it does mean that the card has almost 13% more memory bandwidth than the RX 6900 XT 576GB/s to 512GB/s respectively.

The RX 6950 XT has the same number of stream processors as the RX 6900 XT (5120) as well as the same number of Ray Accelerators (80). With its faster clocks and an additional 35W of TGP as the RX 6900 XT (325W to 300W respectively) the RX 6950 XT is simply able to do more with the hardware it has.

AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT: Performance

(Image credit: Future)

Excellent RTX 3090-level performance (most of the time)

Creative workloads falter

The AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT is unquestionably the best video card AMD has ever put out and while it's not exactly the equal of the RTX 3090 (or the RTX 3080 Ti in some cases) it's still more than enough performance to play the best PC games on ultra settings with some ray tracing and get playable and even enjoyable 4K gaming with the help of AMD FSR.

Test system specs This is the system we used to test the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT: CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D

CPU Cooler: Corsair iCue H150i Elite Capellix 360mm AIO

RAM: Corsair Vengeance LED DDR4-3200

Motherboard: Gigabyte Aorus Master X570 (BIOS F36c)

SSD: Samsung 980 Pro 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD

Power Supply: Corsair AX1000

Case: Praxis Wetbench

FSR support is still rolling out so you may still need to make adjustments to your settings to hit the top of the parabolic curve where graphics quality and 60 fps line up.

But that's the case even with the RTX 3090 Ti with DLSS on which only just barely hits 60 fps (ocassionally) in Cyberpunk 2077's benchmark at 4K with the Ultra Ray Tracing graphics preset. And even then that's its max frame rate its average is in the high 40s while without any upscaling the RTX 3090 Ti only hits 24 fps on those settings.

The RX 6950 XT meanwhile only maxes out in the high 30s with FSR on though it's average is about 29 fps. Without any upscaling support the RX 6950 XT creaks in with 13 fps on these settings.

In nearly all of our benchmarks the RX 6950 XT falls short of the RTX 3090 and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and even the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 depending on the test. But where the RX 6950 XT falters it's not completely bowled over and its greatest weakness is when ray tracing is being pushed to the max.

Nvidia cards are simply better at ray tracing since their ray tracing cores are just a more mature graphics architecture at this stage than AMD's first generation Ray Accelerators introduced with AMD RDNA 2. The RX 6950 XT's rasterization performance is still just as good or better than the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090's with the latest AMD card beating even the RTX 3090 Ti in 3DMark's Fire Strike Ultra.

So while the Nvidia RTX cards are definitely the reigning champs at ray tracing in many cases you simply won't be using ray tracing since even on the top-tier Nvidia GPUs you're still looking at a 4K slideshow without upscaling tech like DLSS and FSR and not every game has implemented those technologies yet. In the case of most games you will be playing for the next couple of years you're much more likely to need to lean on rasterization performance as you always have.

Ray tracing and upscaling tech just isn't fully here yet for it to be a blowout and once you've enjoyed the show with ray tracing for a bit and you actually want to do some 4K gaming at 60fps the RX 6950 XT becomes a lot more competitive especially if you're willing to tweak some settings where appropriate though not on every game out there.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)

The most important thing to say about the RX 6950 XT though is that for a lot of people the idea of owning an RTX 3090 or RTX 3090 Ti is a pipe dream at their MSRP ‚Äì even if it weren't for the silicon shortage dastardly eBay and StockX profiteers and the crypto bubble of 2020 - 2022 mucking things up even further.

At $1099 the RX 6950 XT is roughly 27% cheaper than the RTX 3090 Founders Edition and it's nearly half the price of the RTX 3090 Ti. It's even cheaper than the RTX 3080 Ti and its gaming performance is very competitive against these top three RTX cards when you consider how much performance you get for every dollar spent on the card.

And we do want to stress that this is a gamer's graphics card without a doubt. It does better than every other AMD card on our creative benchmarks but it still way behind where even the RTX 3060 Ti is across Blender's three benchmark tests.

In fact the RX 6950 XT only starts to beat out Nvidia cards in Blender starting at the RTX 3060 and even then it's just barely in only one of the three tests. Similarly it's Adobe Premiere performance lags about 50 points behind the RTX 3060 and the RTX 3060 is about a third of the price of the RX 6950 XT. If you're a creative you have a lot better options out there that will offer you a much better value for the workflows that you need.

All that said while we can't say it's the best graphics card out there the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT is pretty damned great if you're looking for a gaming graphics card especially since it can give you a taste of really premium graphics if you're priced out of the RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti. As this generation of graphics cards winds down ahead of Nvidia Lovelace and AMD RDNA 3 the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT is a great card to close it out with. And who knows? You might even be able to find this one in stock someday.

Should I buy an AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT?

(Image credit: Future)

Buy it if‚Ä¶

You want fantastic non-ray-traced performance

While its ray tracing performance lags premium RTX cards the RX 6950 XT can go toe to toe on rasterzation any day.

You want an ""affordable"" premium graphics card

For a card with this kind of performance the RX 6950 XT is an excellent value that competes with cards nearly twice its MSRP.

You don't want to wait for RDNA 3

As possibly the last of the major AMD RDNA 2 releases the RX 6950 XT is an impressive coda on this generation for Team Red.

Don‚Äôt buy it if‚Ä¶

You can wait another several months

If you're not in an absolute rush to buy a new graphics card AMD RDNA 3 cards are expected to land later this year and they might have a lot more to offer than you'll get with the RX 6950 XT.

You're on a tight budget

The RX 6950 XT is a great value for a card in its class but it's still a very premium card in terms of its price.

You need it for something other than gaming

If you're a creative or you're doing research with machine learning you're going to find the performance here seriously lacking especially for the price.

Also consider

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090

As far as premium cards go the RTX 3090 strikes a great balance between price and performance while having more features like tensor cores and more mature ray tracing cores than those in the RX 6950 XT. Just be willing to hand over an eye-watering sum of money for one. Read the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 review

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti

While only a bit more expensive than the RX 6950 XT the RTX 3080 Ti has a lot of great features that the RX 6950 XT lacks like tensor cores better ray tracing and better creative workload performance. Read the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti review

AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT

The RX 6800 XT might not be nearly as powerful as the RX 6950 XT but its performance-to-price ratio is phenomenal. As a 1440p graphics card this is a fantastic option if you don't need 4K gaming capability and you want to save yourself some real money. Read the full AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT review

I‚Äôve used this laptop for the last few weeks and gathered my thoughts and impressions down below.

Unlike the 2021 Legion Slim 7 reviewed here in the past the 2022 generation is a completely new design both on the outside and on the inside. A new chassis a 16-inch display higher power hardware improved cooling and a 99Wh battery are among the main selling points of this series now.

Lenovo backs this up with competitive pricing at least in today‚Äôs reality where everything has gotten more expensive. However that might vary between regions especially as configurations also vary between countries.

My review unit is a balanced middle-grounder with a 12th-gen Intel Core i7 processor RTX 3060 graphics and a 1600p IPS display but this exact combo isn‚Äôt available everywhere. Regardless we‚Äôll touch on the other screen/spec options in this article so you‚Äôll know what to expect if you decide on getting one of these over any of the other thin-and-light laptops in this niche.

As per Lenovo‚Äôs specs sheets this should be available in multiple other variants going up to Core i9-12900HK RTX 3070 100W and miniLED display configurations. However at the time of this article only the lower-tier 3050Ti and 3060 models are available in most regions.

AMD-based Legion Slim 7 models are also scheduled for a later date. A comparison between the current AMD Ryen 9 and Intel Core i9 platforms is available here.

Update: A 2023 update of the Lenovo Legion Slim 7 series is also available in the meantime.

Design and construction

This year the Legion 7 and Legion Slim 7 share the same design language with the latter being slightly thinner and lighter. Of course they‚Äôre also different on the inside but that‚Äôs not a topic for this article.

That means the Slim 7 is now a darker-grey design with machined milled metal edges ‚Äì in fact they sell this in two grey versions and this variant here is the lighter Storm Grey model. There‚Äôs also an Onyx Grey model which is an almost black kind of grey like the previous generation of the Slim 7.

I was afraid those edges might dent and scratch but I‚Äôm not seeing any mark-ups on my unit after using it for these past weeks not even around the left area near my watch buckle. In comparison the bare-aluminum finishing on my old XPS 13 shows a low of scufss around that area but the materials on the Legion seem to be tougher.

In fact the entire construction feels robust and sturdy and it‚Äôs one of my favorite things about this design. The lid is strong the hinges feel strong and smooth when adjusting the screen angle and there are no flex or squeaky noises in the main chassis. This Legion Slim 7i feels about the same build quality as a MacBook these days. I didn‚Äôt have a MacBook Pro 16 for comparison but I did stanch a few pics of this Slim 7 next to my MBP 13 just for fun.

At the same time while thinner and lighter than the other Legion laptops this Slim 7 is not as compact or as lightweight as other options available in the space today. It weighs 2.2 kilos (4.8 lbs) in the tested version and it‚Äôs a deeper design with a hump behind the screen. It‚Äôs still portable for what it is but I must note that alternatives like a ROG Zephyrus M16 Flow X16 or especially a Blade 15 are smaller and lighter. I‚Äôll have a follow-up post comparing these in the near future.

Now this laptop feels compact in daily use and that‚Äôs because the screen is positioned closer to the user and not all the way to the end of the chassis. Lenovo also implemented narrow edges around the panel with a small chin and a forehead at the top required to house the camera and act as a lever that allows you to easily grab and pick up the display when opening this up.

This Legion Slim 7i is also a friendly and ergonomic design. I already mentioned the sturdy build quality and the solid hinges which keep the display in place without it wobbling. I‚Äôll add up that Lenovo did a fair job at dulling the front edges and corners so they don‚Äôt bite into the wrists as well as implemented a display that leans back flat to 180 degrees.

I also appreciate the dark-grey color scheme which does an excellent job at hiding smudges and fingerprints while still looking sleek. I‚Äôve been using this for weeks and didn‚Äôt even have to wipe it clean for the photo shoot for this article. In contrast the underbelly is black and it shows smudges much easier ‚Äì that‚Äôs normal for black metals. Furthermore if you opt for the Onyx Grey color version of the laptop that‚Äôs also almost the same kind of black as the piece used for the D-panel on this sample and will show smudges.

I‚Äôm still not a fan of the always-lit power button which lights up in different colors based on the power profile in use. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs placed just under the screen and in the line of sight so can be slightly annoying when using the laptop at night. I don‚Äôt find much use for knowing the active profile in this way but at least Lenovo redesigned it and made the lit edging narrower than on the previous generations so I can live with it.

While in here you‚Äôll notice there‚Äôs this array of dots flanking the power button at the top of the keyboard. Those are for ventilation purposes allowing extra fresh air to go into the thermal module and don‚Äôt hide any up-firing speakers. The speakers are still on the bottom just like on all the other Legion laptops.

Speaking of the bottom flipping the laptop upside down you‚Äôll also notice the large and grippy rubber feet as well as the open ventilation over the thermal module. We‚Äôll further discuss this in the cooling section down below.

As far as the IO goes Lenovo didn‚Äôt cut any corners on this laptop despite its slimmer profile. The ports are spread around the edges and the back and include USB-A HDMI 2.1 USB-C ports a card-reader audio-jack e camera eShutter. The only things missing are a K-Lock and a standard LAN port.

The HDMI port on the back hooks into the dGPU. As for the two USB-C ports one supports Thunderbolt 4 with DP via the Intel iGPU and the other supports video straight from the Nvidia dGPU. Both support USB-C charging at up to 135 W of power.

All in all this is the best IO you will find on a portable performance laptop these days. Some other laptops offer all the same ports such as the Gigabyte Aeros or the Acer Predator Triton 500 but the Slim 7i steps up with the excellent arrangement around the sides and on the back allowing for a less-cluttered experience when connecting peripherals.

Keyboard and trackpad

The keyboard on this Slim 7i hasn‚Äôt changed much from the previous Legion 7 models.

The layout is still among the best you‚Äôll find in a portable laptop these days as long as you‚Äôre OK with this sort of design with a NumPad section and not a simpler centered design. The main set of keys are full-size the arrows are also all full-size keys and spaced out from everything around and the NumPad section includes narrower keys.

The keycaps are plastic and color-matched to the dark-gray color of the chassis. That means they won‚Äôt smudge as easily as black keys but at the same time they don‚Äôt feel quite as nice to the touch as the rubbery keycaps implemented by other brands. I‚Äôm definitely nitpicking here but it is what it is.

The feedback on this keyboard is also shallower than on what other OEMs put in their gaming laptops with actuations that require a softer stroke and shorter key travel at 1.3 mm. Being used to shallower keyboards myself I was able to get along fine with this one but the typing experience is a bit unforgiving to straying hands and might not be ideal for everyone. In fact I feel that this keyboard comes close to what Lenovo put on their IdeaPad and Yoga ultraportables. I do appreciate how quietly this types.

For the lighting my sample gets white-only LEDs but a variant with per-key RGB lighting is also available ‚Äì that‚Äôs the same keyboard from the 2021 Legion 7 series.

The LEDs on this sample are bright and uniform but at the same time plenty of light bleeds out from under the keycaps with this design and some of the light shines off the display‚Äôs chin and the Legion logo there. You‚Äôll only notice this if you‚Äôre using the laptop at night in total darkness.

As a side note I still wish Lenovo would allow the lighting to automatically switch off after 30 seconds. There‚Äôs no such time-out option at least none that I could find so I had to always disable the lighting manually by hitting FN + Space (which cycles between the intensities and eventually switches the LEDs off).

The clickpad on this laptop is an averagely-sized glass surface with Precision drivers. It‚Äôs not as spacious as other implementations and smaller than what you‚Äôre getting with the Legion 7 models but it feels smooth to the touch and works just fine with everything you will throw at it. The surface doesn‚Äôt rattle with firmer taps either and the physical clicks feel fine just a bit clunky.

Now due to how this clickpad is centered under the Space key and towards the left side of the chassis accidental palm swipes tend to happen time and again. Palm rejection is overall fairly good but this aspect is still something worth considering especially by those of you with larger hands. The whole thing has been already documented on the existing Legion 7 and Legion 5 Pro laptops so you‚Äôll be able to find more about it online. Derek mentioned it during his time with his 2021 Legion 5 Pro laptop and explained here how you can address them if needed.

As for biometrics there‚Äôs a finger-sensor in the power button but no IR camera.

Screen

There‚Äôs a 16-inch 16:10 display in the 2022 Legion Slim 7 series an upgrade from the 15-inch 16:9 panel used in the previous generation. This aligns the Slim 7 to the Legion 5 Pro and Legion 7 lineups both available with 16-inch displays.

Lenovo mention three panel options for the Slim 7 models:

FHD+ 1920 x 1200 px IPS with 350-nits of brightness and 100% sRGB colors 165Hz 7ms;

QHD+ 2560 x 1600 px IPS with 500-nits of brightness and 100% sRGB colors 165Hz 3ms and GSync support;

QHD+ 2560 x 1600 px IPS miniLED with 1250-nits of brightness and 100% DCI-P3/Adobe RGB colors 165Hz 3ms.

Our unit is the middle-ground QHD+ IPS panel very similar to what Lenovo has been offering on the Legion 7 and Legion 5 Pro models in the last year. It‚Äôs not wide-gamut but otherwise it‚Äôs an excellent multi-purpose display for everyday use and gaming. It also allows for GSync support either on the Hybrid ‚Äì Advanced Optimus mode or on the dGPU MUX mode.

Here‚Äôs what we got in our tests with an X-Rite i1 Display Pro sensor:

Panel HardwareID: MGN007DA1-G;

Coverage: 97.0% sRGB 71.9% DCI-P3 73.8% AdobeRGB;

Measured gamma: 2.19;

Max brightness in the middle of the screen: 494.92 cd/m2 on power;

Min brightness in the middle of the screen: 4.32 cd/m2 on power;

Contrast at max brightness: 1159:1;

White point: 6000 K;

Black on max brightness: 0.42 cd/m2;

PWM: No;

Response: ~7.5ms GtG (source).

Our sample came out somewhat poorly calibrated out of the box with a slightly skewed White point. Everything looks fine after calibration.

Now as far as the color gamut goes sure this panel is not as color-rich as the 100% DCI-P3 500-nits panels offered by competing models and I would have preferred having the option for one of those instead. Still the fact that it can be pushed up in brightness compensates for this to some extent to the point where this doesn‚Äôt actually feel like a regular 100% sRGB panel but as a nicer and more poping display.

The FHD+ panel option offered for this series is only 350-nits and still 100% sRGB but feels duller and more muted in comparison. That‚Äôs still a decent panel for everyday use but if given the choice I‚Äôd definitely pay extra for this QHD+ option.

As for the mini LED panel that‚Äôs not yet available in stores and I‚Äôd reckon it will only be paired with the higher-specced configurations. 16-inch miniLED panels are awesome based on our experience with them on devices such as the ROG Flow X16 or the Zephyrus DUO 16 but they‚Äôre not necessarily ideal for every situation due to the blooming and uniformity artifacts associated with multi-zone lighting. Hence I‚Äôd advise further research if you plan on getting the mini LED panel on this series especially at the added associated cost.

Hardware and performance

Our test model is a mid-specced configuration of the 2022 Lenovo Legion Slim 7i built on an Intel Core i7-12700H processor 16 GB of DDR5-4800 memory in dual channel 1 TB of fast SSD storage and dual graphics: the Nvidia RTX 3060 dGPU with 6 GB of vRAM and the Iris Xe iGPU integrated within the Intel processor.

Disclaimer: This is a retail unit provided for this review by Lenovo and it runs on the software available as of mid-August 2022 (BIOS JYCN39WW Vantage 3.13.14.0 GeForce 516.59 drivers). Some aspects might change with later updates.

Spec-wise this 2022 Legion Slim 7i is built on the latest Intel and Nvidia hardware available to date. The Core i7-12700H is the mainstream performance option in Intel‚Äôs Alder Lake 12th-gen platform with 14 Cores and 20 Threads. It is a hybrid design with 6 High-Performance and dual-threaded Cores and 8 extra Efficiency cores which work together in the various loads. The design and thermal module of this Legion allow the processor to run at up to 80W of sustained power in demanding CPU loads.

For the GPU the 2022 Legion Slim 7i series is available with RTX 3000 graphics chips. What we have on this sample is the mid-tier RTX 3060 running at up to 100W with Dynamic Boost. 3050Ti 95W and 3070 100W configurations are also available but no 3070Ti.

A MUX is still offered here with several modes including dGPU-only or Advanced Optimus (several Hybrid modes). Switching to dGPU requires a restart.

For the RAM this series comes with 8 GB of soldered RAM and one accessible DIMM that can take an either 8 or 16 GB stick. Our unit is a 16 GB of DDR5-4800 RAM configuration. For storage there are two M.2 2280 PCIe gen4 slots on this series and this sample comes preconfigured with a newer-gen and fairly fast SK Hynix drive.

Getting to the components requires you to remove a few Philips screws all visible around the back and then pull up the D-panel. You‚Äôll need a plastic pin and some sort of suction cup to take out the bottom panel as it is very snugly attached to the main chassis ‚Äì getting inside this laptop is more difficult than it should be. Inside the RAM is covered by a metal shield and the SSDs are easily accessible. Thermal pads are placed over the SSDs to allow the heat to spread onto the back metal underbelly.

For the software this unit came with Windows 11 preinstalled and the standard set of Lenovo apps ‚Äì you‚Äôll want to uninstall some of them. I like the predefined wallpaper it looks so much nicer than what most OEMs offer these days.

The power profiles are Quiet Balance and Performance and you can select them from Vantage or switch between them with Fn+Q. These profiles apply different power settings to the CPU/GPU and different fan profiles as well as switch the color of the LED in the power button. Here‚Äôs a table that shows what each mode does:

Quiet (blue) Balance (white) Performance (red) TDP PL1/PL2 TGP TDP PL1/PL2 TGP TDP PL1/PL2 TGP 25/45W ~35W 40W/80W ~85**W 90W/135W* ~100W

*The PL settings for the Performance mode are not a proper indicator of the real-life performance because the CPU is thermally throttled around 75-80W in sustained loads as you‚Äôll see in a bit.

** By default Balance mode sets an 85W TGP for the dGPU. However enabling the Legion Ai Engine option in Vantage allows the GPU to run at up to 100W in this mode as well but with the same kind of noise levels as in Performance mode.

That aside I‚Äôll also mention that this series lacks the option to overclock the GPU in the BIOS/Vantage an option available on other Legion devices. Hence the GPU runs at stock clocks on all modes.

Before we jump to the performance section here‚Äôs how this laptop handles everyday use and multitasking on the Quiet/Balanced profiles unplugged from the wall.

Performance and benchmarks

On to more demanding loads we start by testing the CPU‚Äôs performance by running the Cinebench R15 test for 15+ times in a loop with a 1-2 seconds delay between each run.

The Core i7-12700H processor stabilizes at 75-78W of sustained power on the Performance setting with the laptop sitting on the desk. As mentioned earlier Lenovo applies 90W PL2 and 135W PL1 power limits for this processor on this power mode but the CPU is thermally throttled in this sort of load.

Bumping the back of the laptop off the desk in order to improve the airflow into the fans allows the processor to stabilize at a minimally higher sustained power of 80+W with similar 48-49 dB noise levels and a minimal increase in the Cinebench scores.

Switching over to the Balanced profile translates into the CPU stabilizing at ~40W with quieter fans and cooler temperatures. The Cinebench performance takes a 25% hit over the previous mode.

On the Quiet profile the CPU runs at only 25W with sub 30 dB noise levels and temperatures in the 50s C.

Finally the CPU runs at ~25 W on battery as well on the Performance profile. That‚Äôs an aggressive limitation in comparison to other 12th-gen Intel laptops including the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro reviewed here. Details below.

Overall these profiles could be further tweaked. The laptop is thermally limited on Performance mode and then aggressively power capped on the other modes so there‚Äôs no proper middle-ground profile for those interested in running sustained CPU loads. You‚Äôll most likely go with Performance mode for any serious work but you‚Äôll have to accept the very high CPU temperatures which isn‚Äôt ideal.

To put these findings in perspective here‚Äôs how this Core i7-12700H implementation fares against other mid-tier laptops in this test both Intel and AMD.

The i7 runs at about 80-85% of its capabilities in this design so not as fast as on higher-power implementations. It is a competitive performer though sitting in between other portable designs both Intel or AMD.

We then went ahead and further verified our findings with the more taxing Cinebench R23 loop test and Blender ‚Äì Classroom which resulted in similar findings to what we explained above.

We also ran the 3DMark CPU test on the Performance and Balanced profiles.

Finally we ran our combined CPU+GPU stress tests on this notebook. 3DMark stress runs the same test for 20 times in a loop and looks for performance variation and degradation over time and this unit passed it just fine which means there‚Äôs no performance throttling with longer-duration sustained loads.

Next we ran the entire suite of tests and benchmarks on the Performance profile in Vantage the MUX set on Hybrid mode and on FHD+ screen resolution for consistency with our other tests. Here‚Äôs what we got:

On the CPU side this Intel-based Slim 7i is a fair performer. Just like in the Cinebench loop tests it‚Äôs not as fast as higher-power and better-cooled implementations in the longer sustained loads but it‚Äôs snappy in the shorter runs. Among the portable designs something like the Zephyrus M16 with its higher-power thermal design allows for up to 10% higher sustained performance in the multi-threaded CPU loads. At the same time the Slim 7 is slightly faster than the Razer Blade 15 or the Predator Triton 500 and superior to AMD-based devices such as the ROG Flow X16.

On the GPU side this is a 100W implementation while most other premium thin-and-light designs run at 120-125W with Dynamic Boost. The Blade 15 is the only other option that we‚Äôve tested that runs at similar power and that‚Äôs a more compact product and the TUF Dash F15 runs at 100W as well but that‚Äôs a more affordable model. Hence other high-tier portable options are going to perform about 7-15% faster in GPU-heavy loads. It‚Äôs not a significant difference but something some of you might want to consider in your decision.

As a whole though the Slim 7 is a competitive performer and definitely a step-up from the previous Slim 7 2021 generation. The culprits are the high CPU thermals in sustained loads corroborated with a slightly lower CPU/GPU power design in compared to some of the current alternatives. The differences are within 5-15% and even less with daily use so not necessarily significant.

With that out of the way some of you might not appreciate the loudly spinning fans on the Performance mode which ramp up to 48-49 dB at head level. Thus if you prefer sacrificing the performance to some extent for quieter fan noise here‚Äôs how this Legion Slim 7i does on the Balance profile with the Legion AI option disabled in Vantage which limits the fans at sub 42 dB at head level.

30.92 s; Blender 3.01 ‚Äì Classroom scene ‚Äì CPU Compute: 7m 08s (Balanced).

The CPU performance is hardly impacted on the shorter activities but the 40W PL limit eventually kicks in with demanding loads. The GPU runs at 85W in this mode which results in a 10-15% performance hit from the Performance mode. Thus for general everyday use this Balanced profile makes a lot of sense.

If we‚Äôre to tick the Legion AI option in Vantage that would push the GPU to 100W even on this Balance mode and also push the fans to around 48 dB noise levels. Hence this mode would defeat the purpose of lowering the fan noise.

There‚Äôs also the Silent mode to consider here which keeps the fans at sub 35 dB in sustained loads but this significantly limits both the CPU and GPU so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that for anything intensive.

Gaming performance

Let‚Äôs look at some games now.

We tested a couple of different types of games on the Performance and Balanced profiles at QHD+ and FHD+ resolutions all with the MUX set on the discrete GPU mode.

The gaming performance is fine here within 8-15% lower than on high-power Intel 12th-gen + RTX 3060 implementations such as the Legion 5i Pro within 5-10% of the AMD + RTX 3060 125W ROG Flow X16 and on par with other 100W implementations such as the TUF Dash F15.

With that out of the way let‚Äôs go over some performance and temperature logs.

The Performance mode ramps up the fans to levels of 48-49 dB with the laptop sitting on the desk. That keeps the CPU at around 77-80 degrees Celsius between the tested titles while the GPU runs at between 80-82 degrees. These are fair results and show that Lenovo couldn‚Äôt have pushed for a higher power GPU in this design without affecting temperatures.

Bumping the back of the laptop off the desk in order to improve the airflow into the fans leads to a noticeable decrease in CPU/GPU temperatures with the CPU now running in the high-60s C and the GPU at around 73-75 C. These are excellent temperatures and you should consider bumping up the laptop or placing it on a cooling pad for long gaming sessions. It‚Äôs not required though as the temperatures and performance of a flat surface are already OK here.

There‚Äôs also the option to switch over to the Balance mode. With Legion Ai Engine disabled the fans slow to about 42 dB at head-level and the framerates takes a 10-15% toll from the Performance mode as the GPU power is limited at around 85W. The temperatures are still fine in the high 70s on the CPU and low 80s on the GPU just a little higher than on Performance mode.

With Legion Ai enabled the laptop performs just as on Performance mode with similar fan settings and the GPU being pushed to 100W. Hence the Balance mode makes the most sense with Legion Ai Engine disabled as a way of lowering fan noise while still not greatly limiting the performance.

As for the Quiet mode it keeps the fans at sub 35 dB levels but is hardly usable here as it greatly limits the GPU to around 35W of power. That means you‚Äôll have to trim down to FHD+ with medium graphics settings to get around 60 fps in recent titles.

The laptop‚Äôs performance on battery power is somewhat similar to the Quiet mode explained above but the GPU runs at 45W in this case both on the Performance or the Balanced modes. Hence FHD+ with medium settings should be doable in most games. Don‚Äôt expect more than 1 hour and 30 minutes of gameplay.

Noise Heat Connectivity speakers and others

This Legion Slim 7i gets a standard but efficient thermal module similar to the cooling modules implemented in other Legion laptops.

It includes two fans four radiators and three heatsinks that spread over the components. Unlike in other Legions there are no thermal radiators over the SSDs here instead thermal pads connect the drives to the metal back.

This cooling module works well here with the exception of sustained CPU loads where the CPU ends up thermally limited on the Performance mode. It is nonetheless a miniaturized design in comparison to the larger Legion models hence it can only handle a 100W GPU and the lower-limited CPU.

Most of the fresh air comes inside the laptop through the open intakes on the underbelly and only some through the grills at the top around the power button. As a result these intakes are choked-up by the small-profile implemented rubber feet when the laptop sits on a desk.

That‚Äôs why lifting up the back of the laptop in order to improve the airflow into the fans leads to a significant decrease in internal temperatures. However unlike on the other high-power Legions this Slim 7 actually runs within acceptable temperatures on the desk as well. Thus bumping it up only allows for a more comfortable user experience and lower internal temperatures in the 60s and 70s.

One other aspect to mention here is that dust easily goes inside this laptop due to its open-back design and unlike other brands Lenovo are not isolating the thermal module from the rest of the motherboard with foam so the dust freely goes all over the place. Hence I‚Äôd recommend opening up this laptop from time to time in order to clean it properly and prevent the dust from clogging in.

As far as the fan noise goes we‚Äôre looking at 48 dB at head-level on the Performance mode 42 dB on Balance mode (without Legion Ai Engine) and sub 35 dB on Quiet mode all with demanding activities. With lighter use you‚Äôll hardly hear the fans on Balance or Quiet especially as the fans can also idle with low-intensity tasks.

As far as temperatures go no complaints with daily use. The hottest spot reaches temperatures in the mid-30s and it‚Äôs around the power button so out of touch.

*Daily Use ‚Äì streaming Netflix in EDGE for 30 minutes Quiet profile fans idle or sub 30 dB

With games and with the laptop on a flat surface the hotspot moves in the center and at the top of the keyboard. It reaches temperatures in the mid-4os on Balanced mode and high-40s on Performance and somewhat higher on the back.

In both cases the fact that the hotspot is positioned so low on the chassis means that this Legion Slim 7i is going to feel somewhat uncomfortable for long gaming sessions.

Hence you‚Äôll want to bump up the back of this laptop or place it on some sort of cooling pad to lower the internal and thus the external temperatures. There‚Äôs still a hotspot around the Space key in this case but the overall chassis temperatures drop in comparison to using the laptop on a flat surface.

For connectivity there‚Äôs Wireless 6E and Bluetooth 5 through an Intel-based Killer 1675i chip on this laptop. It proved fast and reliable during my time with the laptop.

Audio is handled by two speakers placed on the bottom of the chassis. Due to how they‚Äôre placed on the flat underbelly you‚Äôll need to be careful not to cover and muffle them when not using the laptop on a desk.

These get fairly loud at close to 80 dB max levels but the audio quality still isn‚Äôt much lacking in the lows and slightly distorting and high volumes. That‚Äôs pretty much the case with the entire Legion lineup and this Slim 7i is no different.

Finally I‚Äôll mention the camera placed at the top of the screen and flanked by microphones. The ensemble does what it‚Äôs supposed to and the camera is FHD resolution and a wide angle so a little better than what you‚Äôre normally getting on laptops these days. I also appreciate the electronic shutter offered on the right side of the laptop which lets you electronically kill both the camera and the microphones when you don‚Äôt need them.

Battery life

There‚Äôs a 99Wh battery inside the Legion Slim 7i configuration which is the largest possible in a laptop and larger than most other portable designs offer.

The system still doesn‚Äôt automatically switch the screen‚Äôs refresh from 165 Hz to 60 Hz when you unplug the laptop as other devices do but I could cycle between the 60 and 165 Hz modes by hitting Fn+R.

It‚Äôs also important to set the laptop on Hybrid-Auto or Hybrid-iGPU only modes in vantage in order to disable the dGPU with battery use.

So here‚Äôs what we got on our unit with the screen‚Äôs brightness set at around 120 nits (~60 brightness) and either 60 or 165 Hz refresh.

These are good runtimes for an Intel 12th-gen laptop and overall this Slim 7i is more efficient than the majority of other Alder Lake Core H laptops we‚Äôve tested this year.

I‚Äôll also add that Lenovo pairs this configuration with a mid-sized 230W power brick a dual-piece design with long cables and a total weight of just under 1 kilo. You can also charge the laptop via USB-C at up to 135W in case you don‚Äôt want to bring along the main charger just be aware that it‚Äôs not going to run at full capabilities on USB-C power.

Price and availability- Legion Slim 7i

The Legion Slim 7i is available in some areas of the world at the time of this article.

The Intel i7 + RTX 3060 configuration is listed in Lenovo‚Äôs US store at $1549 (discounted for $1899 MSRP) but that‚Äôs for the lesser FHD 350-nits display option. A 3050Ti configuration with the QHD+ display is also available for under $1800 but the other models are not yet listed in North America.

Over here in Europe the series is available with the QHD+ display for around 2000 EUR for the i7 + RTX 3060 model or 1600 EUR for the i5 + RTX 3050Ti variant. If possible I‚Äôd recommend going with the QHD+ screen option over the basic FHD+.

Follow this link for updated configurations and prices in your region at the time you‚Äôre reading this article.

The AMD-based 2022 Legion Slim 7 models are not yet available in stores but should be in the near future. I expect those to sell for less than these Intel configurations.

Final thoughts- 2022 Lenovo Legion Slim 7i

I enjoyed my time with this laptop and I think it‚Äôs a fair all-arounder for those of you looking for an all-purpose premium-feeling notebook at a competitive price.

The excellent build quality the IO and ergonomics and the 16-inch screen options are the main selling points of this series corroborated with the balanced capabilities and long battery life.

At the same time this is not as powerful as the other Legion laptops out there and in fact not as powerful as many of the other thin-and-light designs in the same class. Furthermore given the noisy fans and high chassis temperatures on the Performance mode I‚Äôd recommend using this laptop on the mid-level Balance profile which does a better job juggling with the performance thermals and noise levels.

Alternatives such as the full-size Lenovo Legion 7 offer superior performance and cooling while other portable designs such as the ROG Flow X16 or the ROG Zephyrus M16 offer better screens better performance and better cooling in smaller/lighter designs. The Slim 7i has the pricing on its side though at least when available on sale so as long as you‚Äôre OK with its capabilities and limitations and you can find this for a good price I‚Äôd expect you to be happy with what you‚Äôll be getting.

This wraps out my time with this 2022 Lenovo Legion Slim 7i series but I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on the series and feedback on my review so get in touch in the comments section down below.

Real estate investment trusts ‚Äì or REITs for short ‚Äì can be fantastic securities for generating meaningful portfolio income. REITs widely offer higher dividend yields than the average stock.

While the S&P 500 Index on average yields less than 1.5% right now it is relatively easy to find REITs with dividend yields of 5% or higher.

The following downloadable REIT list contains a comprehensive list of U.S. Real Estate Investment Trusts along with metrics that matter including:

How To Use The REIT List To Find Dividend Stock Ideas

REITs give investors the ability to experience the economic benefits associated with real estate ownership without the hassle of being a landlord in the traditional sense.

Because of the monthly rental cashflows generated by REITs these securities are well-suited to investors that aim to generate income from their investment portfolios. Accordingly dividend yield will be the primary metric of interest for many REIT investors.

For those unfamiliar with Microsoft Excel the following images show how to filter for REITs with dividend yields between 5% and 7% using the ‚Äòfilter‚Äô function of Excel.

Click here to download your Complete REIT Excel Spreadsheet List now. Keep reading this article to learn more.

Step 1: Download the Complete REIT Excel Spreadsheet List at the link above.

Step 2: Click on the filter icon at the top of the ‚ÄòDividend Yield‚Äô column in the Complete REIT Excel Spreadsheet List.

Step 3: Use the filter functions ‚ÄòGreater Than or Equal To‚Äô and ‚ÄòLess Than or Equal To‚Äô along with the numbers 0.05 ad 0.07 to display REITs with dividend yields between 5% and 7%.

This will help to eliminate any REITs with exceptionally high (and perhaps unsustainable) dividend yields.

Also click on ‚ÄòDescending‚Äô at the top of the filter window to list the REITs with the highest dividend yields at the top of the spreadsheet.

Now that you have the tools to identify high-quality REITs the next section will show some of the benefits of owning this asset class in a diversified investment portfolio.

Why Invest in REITs?

REITs are by design a fantastic asset class for investors looking to generate income.

Thus one of the primary benefits of investing in these securities is their high dividend yields.

The currently high dividend yields of REITs is not an isolated occurrence. In fact this asset class has traded at a higher dividend yield than the S&P 500 for decades.

Related: Dividend investing versus real estate investing.

The high dividend yields of REITs are due to the regulatory implications of doing business as a real estate investment trust.

In exchange for listing as a REIT these trusts must pay out at least 90% of their net income as dividend payments to their unitholders (REITs trade as units not shares).

Sometimes you will see a payout ratio of less than 90% for a REIT and that is likely because they are using funds from operations not net income in the denominator for REIT payout ratios (more on that later).

REIT Financial Metrics

REITs run unique business models. More than the vast majority of other business types they are primarily involved in the ownership of long-lived assets.

From an accounting perspective this means that REITs incur significantnon-cash depreciation and amortization expenses.

How does this affect the bottom line of REITs?

Depreciation and amortization expenses reduce a company‚Äôs net income which means that sometimes a REIT‚Äôs dividend will be higher than its net income even though its dividends are safe based on cash flow.

Related: How To Value REITs

To give a better sense of financial performance and dividend safety REITs eventually developed the financial metric funds from operations or FFO.

Just like earnings FFO can be reported on a per-unit basis giving FFO/unit ‚Äì the rough equivalent of earnings-per-share for a REIT.

FFO is determined by taking net income and adding back various non-cash charges that are seen to artificially impair a REIT‚Äôs perceived ability to pay its dividend.

For an example of how FFO is calculated consider the following net income-to-FFO reconciliation from Realty Income (O) one of the largest and most popular REIT securities.

Source: Realty Income Annual Report

In 2021 net income was $359 million while FFO available to stockholders was above $1.4 billion a sizable difference between the two metrics. This shows the profound effect that depreciation and amortization can have on the GAAP financial performance of real estate investment trusts.



The Top 7 REITs Today

Below we have ranked our top 7 REITs today based on expected total returns.

Expected total returns are in turn made up from dividend yield expected growth on a per unit basis and valuation multiple changes. Expected total return investing takes into account income (dividend yield) growth andvalue.

Note: The REITs below have not been vetted for safety. These are high expected total return securities but they may come with elevated risks.

We encourage investors to fully consider the risk/reward profile of these investments.

Top REIT #7: Chimera Inv. Corp. (CIM)

Expected Total Return: 16.7%

16.7% Dividend Yield: 14.1%

Chimera Investment Corporation is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that is a specialty finance company. The company‚Äôs primary business is in investing through subsidiaries in a diversified portfolio of mortgage assets including residential mortgage loans Non-Agency RMBS Agency CMBS and other real estate related securities.

Chimera‚Äôs income is predominantly obtained by the difference between the income the company earns on its assets and financing and hedging costs. The company funds the purchase of assets through several funding sources: asset securitization repurchase agreements (repo) warehouse lines and equity capital.

Chimera has exhibited a markedly volatile performance record over the last decade. Since 2012 it has grown its earnings-per-share at a 1.2% average annual rate but it has seen its earnings decline in the last five years. Moreover the REIT has been caught off-guard with a high debt load in the downturn caused by the latest surge in inflation.

Top REIT #6: AGNC Investment Corporation (AGNC)

Expected Total Return: 16.8%

16.8% Dividend Yield: 11.6%

American Capital Agency Corp was founded in 2008 and is a mortgage real estate investment trust that invests primarily in agency mortgage-backedsecurities (or MBS) on a leveraged basis.

The firm‚Äôs asset portfolio is comprised of residential mortgage pass-throughsecurities collateralized mortgage obligations (or CMO) and non-agencyMBS. Many of these are guaranteed by government sponsored enterprises.

The majority of American Capital‚Äôs investments are fixed rate agency MBS. Most of these are MBS with a 30-year maturity period. AGNC derives nearly all its revenue in the form of interest income. It currently generates $1.2 billion in annual net revenue.

You can see an overview of the company‚Äôs second-quarter report in the image below:

Source: Investor Presentation

AGNC reported its Q2 2022 results on July 25 2022. Q2 net spread and dollar roll income per share stood at 83 cents up from 72 cents sequentially. Tangible net book value stood at $11.43 as of June 30 2022. Economic return on tangible common equity stood at -10.1% compared to -14.4% sequentially. AGNC also reported a net loss per common share of $(0.87). The company‚Äôs investment portfolio as of June 30 2022 stood at $61.3 billion.

Furthermore the trust at an average repurchase price of $10.78 per share repurchased 4.7 million common shares. Meanwhile cash and unencumbered agency MBS amounted approximately $2.8 billion at quarter end.

We expect 16.8% annual returns for AGNC made up of the 11.6% dividend yield negative growth of -0.9% and a ~6.1% boost from a rising P/FFO multiple.

Top REIT #5: The Macerich Company (MAC)

Expected Total Return: 16.8%

16.8% Dividend Yield: 5.7%

Macerich Company is one of the country‚Äôs leading owners operators and developers of major retail real estate. The

company owns 51 million square feet of real estate consisting primarily of interests in 47 regional shopping centers.

The company has a significant presence in the West Coast Arizona Chicago and the Metro New York to Washington DC corridor.

Source: Investor Presentation

Thanks to the recovery of the economy from the pandemic and pent-up consumer demand business momentum has improved in recent months with the tenants of the REIT currently enjoying higher sales than pre-pandemic levels. Macerich expects FFO per share of $1.90-$2.04 this year.

Macerich has properties in densely populated areas with high barriers to entry. However its poor performance record does not indicate the existence of a meaningful competitive advantage.

Moreover Macerich has a high debt load as its interest expense currently exceeds its operating income and its net debt stands at $4.8 billion which is 185% its current market cap. The high debt load is a major concern particularly given the secular decline of this business.

Top REIT #4: Medical Properties Trust (MPW)

Expected Total Return: 17.6%

17.6% Dividend Yield: 7.2%

Medical Properties Trust is the only pure-play hospital REIT today. It owns a well-diversified portfolio of over 400 properties which are leased to over 30 different operators. The great majority of the assets are general acute care hospitals but show some diversification into other specialty hospitals including inpatient rehabilitation and long-term acute care.

The portfolio of assets is also well diversified across different geographies with properties in 29 states to mitigate the risk of demand and supply imbalances in individual markets. On top of its US portfolio Medical Properties maintains a strategic exposure to key European markets including Germany the UK Italy and Australia.

Medical Properties‚Äô FFO/share growth has been strong over the past decade as it has gone from $0.72 in 2011 to $1.75 in 2021. Looking ahead the trust expects its aggressive acquisition pipeline to combine with its defensive net-leases to drive growth.

We expect annual returns of 17.6% per year driven by 5.3% AFFO-per-share growth the 7.2% dividend yield and a 5.1% annual boost from an expanding P/FFO multiple.

Top REIT #3: Douglas Emmett (DEI)

Expected Total Return: 19.1%

19.1% Dividend Yield: 5.2%

Douglas Emmett is the largest office landlord in Los Angeles and Honolulu with a 38% average market share of office space in its sub-markets. The REIT generates 86% of its revenue from its office portfolio and 14% of its revenue from its multifamily portfolio. It has approximately 2700 office leases in its portfolio annual revenue of $1 billion and a market capitalization of $4.5 billion.

Source: Investor Presentation

The merits of being the largest office landlord in Los Angeles are obvious as Los Angeles County is the third-largest city in the world with GDP of $1 trillion behind only Tokyo and New York. The dominant position of Douglas Emmett creates operational synergies. In addition the REIT benefits from high barriers to entry which reduce competition. Moreover the proximity to premier housing attracts affluent tenants who offer reliable cash flows to the company.

The markets of Douglas Emmett are characterized by high rent growth and relatively low volatility. Rents in the West Los Angeles submarkets of the REIT have grown 150% over the last 25 years at a 3.7% average annual rate the highest growth rate among all the U.S. gateway markets.

Douglas Emmett certainly benefits from this trend as its leases include 3%-5% annual rent hikes. Thanks to this tailwind the company has grown its adjusted FFO per share at a 3.5% average annual rate over the last decade.

Top REIT #2: Brandywine Real Estate (BDN)

Expected Total Return: 20.7%

20.7% Dividend Yield: 9.0%

Brandywine Realty Trust owns develops leases and manages an urban town center and transit-oriented portfolio which includes 168 properties in Philadelphia Austin and Washington D.C. The REIT generates 74% of its operating income in Philadelphia 22% of its operating income in Austin and the remaining 4% in Washington D.C.

As Brandywine Realty Trust generates the vast portion of its operating income in Philadelphia and Austin it is worth noting the advantages of these two areas. According to official reports Philadelphia has the highest growth rate of highly educated citizens since 2008 while Austin is the fastest-growing metropolitan area the best place to start business and it has retrieved all the jobs lost due to the pandemic.

Brandywine Realty Trust is offering an above-average 9.0% dividend yield. Given the solid payout ratio of 54% the dividend looks enticing on the surface. However it is important to note that the REIT operates with a nosebleed leverage ratio (Net Debt to EBITDA) of 7.0. It also has a heavy schedule of debt maturities until the end of 2024. As a result the dividend is likely to come under pressure in the event of an unforeseen downturn.

The high debt load is probably the primary reason behind the freeze of the dividend for 14 consecutive quarters. Moreover Brandywine Realty Trust is sensitive to recessions due to its weak balance sheet and the sensitivity of its tenants to recessions.

Still we expect annual returns above 20% driven by the 9% dividend yield expected FFO-per-share growth of 3% and a sizable boost from an expanding valuation multiple.

Top REIT #1: SL Green Realty (SLG)

Expected Total Return: 21.4%

21.4% Dividend Yield: 7.9%

SL Green Realty Corp was formed in 1980. It is an integrated real estate investment trust (REIT) that is focused on acquiring managing and maximizing the value of Manhattan commercial properties. It is Manhattan‚Äôs largest office landlord and currently owns 73 buildings totaling 35 million square feet.

It is Manhattan‚Äôs largest office landlord and currently owns 73 buildings totaling 35 million square feet.

Source: Investor Presentation

In mid-July SLG reported (7/20/2022) financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Its occupancy rate slipped from 92.7% at the end of the previous quarter to 92.0% but its same-store net operating income grew 6.7% over the prior year‚Äôs quarter.

Given also a benefit of $0.14 per share from assets purchases and sales its funds from operations (FFO) per share grew 17% over the prior year‚Äôs quarter from $1.60 to $1.87. The REIT exceeded the analysts‚Äô consensus by $0.17. During the quarter SLG signed 39 Manhattan office leases for a total of 188822 square feet.

We expect annual returns of 21.4% going forward comprised of 5% expected earnings growth the 7.9% dividend yield and a ~8.5% annual boost from an expanding P/FFO multiple.

Final Thoughts

The REIT Spreadsheet list in this article contains a list of publicly-traded Real Estate Investment Trusts.

However this database is certainly not the only place to find high-quality dividend stocks trading at fair or better prices.

In fact one of the best methods to find high-quality dividend stocks is looking for stocks with long histories of steadily rising dividend payments. Companies that have increased their payouts through many market cycles are highly likely to continue doing so for a long time to come.

You can see more high-quality dividend stocks in the following Sure Dividend databases each based on long streaks of steadily rising dividend payments:

Alternatively another great place to look for high-quality business is inside the portfolios of highly successful investors. By analyzing the portfolios of legendary investors running multi-billion dollar investment portfolios we are able to indirectly benefit from their million-dollar research budgets and personal investing expertise.

To that end Sure Dividend has created the following two articles:

This is because of non-adherance to the T-structure by the region due to failure to maintain funds amounting to next two quarters of debt servicing obligations in the debt service reserve account.

""The rating action also reflects the increasing strain on the financial risk profile of the guarantor GoAP as manifested in among others the reduction in its funding support to meet APCRDA's debt repayment obligations"" the ratings agency said.

According to the T-structure government of Andhra Pradesh is required to credit in advance the bond servicing account with funds worth 1.5 times the upcoming debt repayment obligation.

However in case this is not done by T1-7 days funds from the DSRA will have to be utilised to fund the bond servicing account.

Since the account was not sufficiently funded to meet the interest obligation falling due on August 16 the trustee dipped into the DSRA and used around Rs 26 crore to partially service the interest of Rs 52 crore.

Consequently APCRDA currently has only 1.5 quarters of funded DSRA.

Published 7:30 am Saturday August 20 2022

1 of 2

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Are you a City of Washington resident who recycles garbage items? If not what are barriers that keep you from doing it?

One of the barriers to recycling can be a lack of knowledge about what can be recycled and what can not. What can be recycled are plastics metal and paper. Examples of plastics are water soda juice milk and detergent bottles. These bottles must be emptied out and have no pumps. All metal cans can be recycled but they need to be emptied out as well. Newspaper (without inserts or flyers) can be recycled in addition to office paper notebooks envelopes and flattened cardboard. Glass can be recycled in the City of Washington‚Äôs community glass recycling convenience center located at 250 Plymouth Street. The center only accepts brown clear and green glass bottles and jars. They will neither accept bags nor aluminum.

Any item(s) not listed above must go in green trash carts.

Recycling sounds like a great way to have a lasting positive impact on the environment from the comfort of your home but is it effective?

A 2019 study from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund and the Environment North Carolina Research and Policy Center shows that in fiscal year 2016-2017 North Carolina landfilled more than 9.7 million tons of waste and recovered 1.7 million tons for a low recovery rate of almost 15%. This is due to international waste trade restrictions municipalities across the state reducing the number of recyclable materials they will accept ‚Äì including some glass and plastics.

‚ÄúIn FY 2016-2017 North Carolina generated 5.5 pounds of trash per resident each day a full 2 pounds less than in FY 2005-2006. However most of that waste reduction occurred between 2008 and 2010 ‚Äì waste generation then increased during FY 2015-2016. This could potentially be connected to the number of local government waste reduction and reuse programs falling from 108 in 2015 to 93 in 2017‚Äù the report states.

Following the trend in 2020 Beaufort County commissioners voted 6-1 to end its recycling services per an earlier article from The Daily News. This means they would no longer accept paper plastic and metal items. The vote was made to end the service because service provider ‚Äì Republic Services ‚Äì notified the county that the cost of recycling would increase from $66 per metric ton to $110 per metric ton. The annual cost would have risen from $15180 to $25300 for recycling an average of 230 tons of material the Daily News reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS9uZXh0LzIwMjIvMDgvMjAvY3plY2gtZmlybS13YW50cy10by11c2UtM2QtcHJpbnRpbmctdG8taGVscC1yZWJ1aWxkLXVrcmFpbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could 3D printing technology help rebuild Ukraine's damaged towns and cities?,"By Euronews

The Icon of the Seas is scheduled to go into service as the first ship in this series in the fall. Not much is known about the ship but RCI is already promising ‚Äúthe best family vacation in the world‚Äù.

Royal Caribbean International is launching a major marketing campaign for Icon of the Seas with a video series entitled making an Icon and Episode 1 Envisioning an Iconic Vacation.

RCI's CEO Michael Bayley describes the ship in the first video episode as ""the best thing Royal Caribbean has built in the last 50 years"". Jay Schneider Chief Product Innovation Officer speaks of the ""best family vacation in the world"". The video uses terms like ‚Äújaw-droppingly amazing‚Äù ‚Äúgroundbreaking unparalleled‚Äù or ‚Äútransformational vacation experience‚Äù. The Icon of the Seas will revolutionize the world of cruising.

However the first video episode does not yet contain specific details about the new icon class but it does contain interesting insights into the planning process for a new ship class and some pictures of the construction of the Icon of the Seas in Turku Finland.

If you take a closer look at the video you can at least see some details that have already been discussed by observers in recent months:

""Pearl"": A spherical structure with an alleged diameter of around 15 meters is said to bear the name ""Pearl"". It is not yet known what lies behind this mysterious construction. It is clear that the pearl was delivered to the shipyard in one piece and positioned approximately in the middle of the ship.

""Aqua Dome"": The name ""Aqua Dome"" has been publicly mentioned by Royal Caribbean before but again it is unclear what exactly is behind it. Thought to be located above the bridge so similar to the solarium on the Oasis and Quantum class ships it could be a novel water theme park especially as RCI announces great water activities for the Icon of the Seas.

Vertical stem: More and more new cruise ships now have a vertical stem and one can be seen in the video. So the bow shape of the Icon of the Seas will probably follow this trend.

What is officially known so far is that the Icon of the Seas will be powered by liquid gas (LNG) and that advanced environmental technology will be used. According to details from the shipping company's financial report there should be room for around 5600 passengers on the Icon of the Seas.

The Icon of the Seas will probably debut in Great Britain but will then have Miami as its base port for the 2023/24-winter season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy52b2ljZS1vbmxpbmUuY28udWsvbmV3cy91ay1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvMjEvZXhjbHVzaXZlLWxlYWRpbmctYmxhY2stdG9yaWVzLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1ncm91cC1haW1lZC1hdC13aWRlbmluZy1wYXJ0eXMtYXBwZWFsLXRvLWFmcmljYW4tY2FyaWJiZWFuLXZvdGVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EXCL: Black Tories to launch group to appeal to African Caribbean voters,"BLACK TORIES are joining forces to launch a new organisation aimed at improving the relationship between the Conservative Party and the black community.

The 2022 Group which will launch in October consists of MPs councillors and activists who want to see the party better engage with black voters.

The idea for the group came after former Number 10 special advisor Samuel Kasumu discussed the idea with fellow party members Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones the agricultural entrepreneur widely known as The Black Farmer and Police & Crime Commissioner Festus Akinbusoye during a series of dinners at the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) in Pall Mall which began last September.

Among the 2022 Group‚Äôs key areas of focus will be increasing the overall numbers of Black Conservatives in national and local government and holding public appointments. It also aims to influence party policy on domestic and international issues.

David Cameron led efforts to make the Conservative Party more diverse when he became party leader in 2005

Other policy areas include supporting an increase in trade with Commonwealth countries.

After he became party leader in 2005 former prime minister David Cameron launched the ‚ÄòA-List‚Äô a list drawn up by Conservative Central Office of 100 preferred prospective parliamentary candidates aimed at widening the party‚Äôs appeal to a diverse electorate.

Political observers have claimed that the legacy of that move produced seemed to fulfil Cameron‚Äôs bold 2015 pledge that the first Black or Asian prime minister would come from the Conservative Party.

The current party leadership race saw candidates such as Nadhim Zahawi Rishi Sunak Kemi Badenoch and Suella Braverman standing in its early stages producing a diverse contest not matched by any political party in Europe.

You need competition because it breeds innovation. It means better policies and better ideas that appeal to different people. Samuel Kasumu former No 10 special adviser

No political party in a major western democracy has ever produced a leadership field with anything like the levels of ethnic diversity in the Conservative contest of 2022.

But despite this progress Kasumu told The Voice that the party still struggles to win over black voters.

‚ÄúWhen you look at the Conservative party you‚Äôll find that if you are from an African Caribbean background you‚Äôre very likely to be able to progress as much as your gifts and talents take you‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYou can be someone like Kemi Badenoch become a Cabinet minister and do very well in the party leadership race. Or you could be someone like me who joined the party as a 19-year-old and became the most senior black advisor in government.

Challenge

‚ÄúSo the challenge is not what happens once you become a member. The challenge is that a lot of Black people who might have similar values on issues such as education family and enterprise and who might see themselves as conservative often feel like they cannot or will not join the party. We want to try and find a way to deal with this and enable them to see that the Conservative Party is open to them.‚Äù

Kasumu‚Äôs resignation as No 10 special adviser prompted wide speculation about why he left. But Kasumu told The Voice there was no rift with Boris Johnson

He continued: ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going to agree with everything that everybody says in the party. We are a broad church. Within the party you have radical Brexiteers you have One Nation Conservatives you have those on the more liberal wing. This is what we‚Äôre really trying to present to the community as well as highlight the fact that there are plenty of opportunities for people to go as far as their gifts and talents can take them.‚Äù

Among some of the leading Black Conservatives who have attended the group‚Äôs meeting ahead of its October launch are education secretary and former party chairman James Cleverley Hitchin Harpenden MP Bim Afolami Maidstone and The Weald MP Helen Grant and former London Mayoral election candidate Shaun Bailey.

Loyal

Kasumu acknowledges that Black voters have traditionally been loyal to the Labour Party but says that politics as a whole and not just the Conservative Party can benefit from a shift in allegiance.

‚ÄúIf a community of people feel like they can only ever vote for one party that party may end up taking their votes for granted. Also the opposition party the opposition party may feel this community‚Äôs votes are not worth fighting for. But you need competition because it breeds innovation. It means better policies and better ideas that appeal to different people.‚Äù

The launch of the 2022 Group follows Kasumu‚Äôs decision to resign as No 10‚Äôs special adviser for civil society and communities in April last year.

Departure

At the time it was widely speculated that his departure was linked to the widely criticised report from the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities which controversially denied the existence of structural and institutional racism.

However it is a claim that Kasumu is keen to downplay.

‚ÄúWhat I will say and this is not necessarily a popular thing to say is that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson was always very encouraging to me to go for the things I was passionate about. I never had any issue. Beyond that as a special advisor your job is to advise and it‚Äôs for ministers to decide. And if people don‚Äôt necessarily agree with some of the advice you have a choice about how to respond.‚Äù

As well as preparing plans for the launch of the 2022 Group Kasumu is focusing on his next move in politics as a candidate in the London Mayoral elections of 2024.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm certainly an outsider‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAlthough I‚Äôm a local councillor I‚Äôm not a former MP or secretary of state. I‚Äôm an outsider in London because I‚Äôm a Black Tory. So therefore the way I run my campaign will have to be untraditional. I‚Äôll have to just do my way.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNyaWNrZXRlci5jb20vVG9waWNzL3N0LWx1Y2lhLWtpbmdzL2NhcmliYmVhbl9wcmVtaWVyX2xlYWd1ZV8yMDIyX2FsbF95b3VfbmVlZF90b19rbm93Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caribbean Premier League 2022: All you need to know,"Caribbean Premier League 2022: All you need to know

What is it?

The Caribbean Premier League is a six-team domestic T20 competition hosted across the Caribbean. It has been running since 2013.

When is it?

The tournament is scheduled to start on Wednesday August 31 with last year's champions St Kitts & Nevis Patriots taking on Jamaica Tallawahs. The competition will run slightly longer than last year with the final being played a month later on Friday September 30.

The 6ixty a brand new T10 competition organised by Cricket West Indies will precede the CPL season expected to run from Wednesday 24 August to Sunday 28 August.

What's the format?

Following the same trend as several franchise competitions all six teams will play against each other twice in the group stage with teams being awarded two points for a win one for a draw and zero for a defeat. The top four teams will qualify for the playoffs.

In a slight change to last year's knockout stage Qualifier 1 will see the top two teams play each other whilst third and fourth-placed teams will battle it out in an Eliminator. The winner of Qualifier 1 will progress straight to the final with the loser meeting the winner of the Eliminator in Qualifier 2. Winner of Qualifier 2 will meet the winner of Qualifier 1 in the final to determine the winners.

Where is it?

CPL 2022 will take place across four venues. Warner Park in St Kitts and Nevis will host the opening seven matches of the tournament. The competition will then move to St Lucia where the next eight matches will be played at the Darren Sammy Cricket Ground. Matches 16 to 23 will be played at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad before the final seven group games and playoffs are hosted in Guyana at the Providence Stadium.

Which teams are involved?

There are six teams competing in CPL 2022. They are founding members Barbados Royals (formerly Barbados Tridents) Guyana Amazon Warriors Jamaica Tallawahs St Lucia Kings (formerly St Lucia Zouks) Trinbago Knight Riders and St Kitts & Nevis Patriots who joined the competition in 2015.

Trinbago Knight Riders are the most successful team in the CPL lifting the trophy four times in 2015 2017 2018 and 2020. Inaugural champions Jamaica Tallawahs (2013 2016) and Barbados Royals (2014 2019) have two titles each.

Guyana Amazon Warriors have been very unlucky throughout the history of the CPL as despite reaching the final on five occasions they have never walked away with the trophy.

St Kitts & Nevis Patriots are the defending champions having beaten St Lucia Kings in last year's final. Both teams have only appeared in the final twice.

What happened last year?

The 2021 Caribbean Premier League saw a very tight group stage with the three top teams recording six wins and four defeats to leave them tied on 12 points. Trinbago Knight Riders topped the group by having the highest net run rate followed by Guyana Amazon Warriors and then St Kitts & Nevis Patriots. St Lucia Kings took the final qualification spot with 10 points. Jamaica Tallawahs missed out by just two points with Barbados Royals finishing last by only managing to win three of their 10 games.

Kings surprised everyone by beating favourites Trinbago Knight Riders by 21 runs to set up a clash in the final with the Patriots. The Patriots had impressively chased down 179 with 13 balls to spare against Guyana Amazon Warriors.

St Kitts & Nevis Patriots triumphed in a thrilling final as they won off the very last ball. Dominic Drakes was instrumental in the Patriots' victory as he made an unbeaten 48 runs off 24 balls.

Roston Chase was the tournament's top run-scorer for runners-up Kings he made 446 runs at an average of 49.55. Ravi Rampaul for Trinbago Knight Riders took 19 scalps across the competition at an average of 16.21 finishing as the leading wicket-taker.

Who are the overseas players?

South Africa dominate the overseas signings with fan favourites Imran Tahir (Guyana) and Faf du Plessis (St Lucia) making a return to this yea'‚Äôs competition. Tabraiz Shamsi will join Tahir at the Warriors to make up an exciting leg-spinning duo with David Miller and Quinton de Kock signing for Barbados Royals.

Other notable overseas players include New Zealand trio Colin Munro Tim Seifert (both Trinbago) and David Wiese (St Lucia); prolific Pakistan bowler Mohammed Amir (Jamaica); and promising talent from Singapore Tim David who will appear for St Lucia.

Overall there will be as many as 30 overseas signings. The players consist of 11 South Africans three apiece for Pakistan New Zealand and Sri Lanka two for Afghanistan and Ireland and then one each for Nepal Australia Singapore Namibia and the USA. There will be no English players who will compete in this year's tournament.

Rovman Powell will be crucial for Jamaica Tallawahs [Getty Images/CPL]

Who are the players to watch?

Jamaica Tallawahs - Rovman Powell

A middle-order batter who occasionally bowls medium pace Powell is known for his big hitting. He has been a consistent performer domestically when playing for Jamaica with a List A average of 30.28. He has been in and out of the West Indies team but has featured in their three most recent T20 matches against India. If he gets time at the crease he can be an extremely destructive player.

Barbados Royals - Quinton de Kock

Making his debut in the CPL the South African wicket-keeper batsmen is sure to set this tournament alight. Despite three consecutive low scores against England in the T20 series his average in the format sits at a very respectable 31.86 with five centuries. The Royals will hope De Kock provides them with a dynamic edge.

Guyana Amazon Warriors - Imran Tahir

Tahir is one of the great entertainers. With his unique bowling action and animated celebration Tahir is a fan favourite and a fierce and respected competitor. He provided a moment of history last year as he became the first bowler to take a hat-trick in the inaugural edition of The Hundred. He has been at his best in recent years. This will be his third consecutive CPL with Guyana Amazon Warriors. Look out for his 'marathon' celebration.

St Kitts & Nevis Patriots - Dominic Drakes

Named player of the match in last year's final Dominic Drakes brought the trophy home by scoring a magnificent 48 not out from 24 balls. Moving from Barbados Royals in 2019 Drakes has been a key component for the Patriots both with his bowling and his batting.

St Lucia Kings - Roston Chase

A player who was once a pivotal spin-bowler in the West Indies Test team Chase has converted into an excellent allrounder for the shortest format of the game. Top scorer in last year's CPL with 446 runs Chase powered his team to the final and despite their agonising defeat the man from Barbados was awarded player of the tournament. Fans will be hoping that he can replicate this form once again in the hope that the Kings can go one step further and claim their first ever title.

Trinbago Knight Riders - Kieron Pollard

Kieron Pollard is a CPL legend. He led the Royals to the title in 2014 and then captained the Knight Riders to their fourth trophy in 2020. He has a T20 average of 31.2 with a high score of 104 and an ability to hit balls to all parts. The Knight Riders will have a very good chance at making it five CPL titles if their captain has a good tournament.

Please enter a valid email address.

Two generations of boxing are coming face-to-face in Arlington Texas in just about two months and neither Mike Tyson nor Jake Paul Is hiding their age.

Tyson 57 and Paul 27 began their press tour for their much-anticipated fight on Monday at the legendary Apollo Theater in Harlem New York. And despite just being miles from where Tyson grew up the crowd seemed pretty split between the two.

The July 20 bout will mark Tyson‚Äôs first fight in over four years when he fought Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition (Paul was on that undercard against Nate Robinson). It will be a sanctioned professional fight which Tyson hasn‚Äôt participated in since June 11 2005 against Kevin McBride.

Formerly known as the ""Baddest Man on the Planet"" Tyson has been posting clips of his training and make no mistake his power is still there.

But he‚Äôs no spring chicken.

Of course there are doubts whether at his age he can last the eight rounds each of which will be two minutes.

DEONTAY WILDER SCARED FOR MIKE TYSON'S WELL-BEING IN JAKE PAUL FIGHT: HE'S TOO OLD FOR THIS'

Once a man who exuded more confidence than anyone Tyson obviously knows that Father Time is undefeated and he was brutally honest about how he feels physically.

""My body is s--- right now"" he admitted on Monday. ""I‚Äôm really sore.""

That confidence Tyson once had Paul has it all if not more.

The YouTuber-turned-boxer has made the sport the most popular it has been since Tyson‚Äôs heyday. He‚Äôs done it in a much different way but it‚Äôs not hyperbole when one says this may be the biggest fight in modern history.

It‚Äôs almost ironic that Paul is going from boxers hardly anyone ever heard of in his last two fights (Andre August and Ryan Bourland each of whom were first-round knockouts) to arguably the best ever.

So when a fan asked Paul if he could ""take a hit"" from Tyson that confidence was on full display.

""They call him Iron Mike Tyson but I‚Äôm Titanium Jake Paul.""

Prior he said ""I'm going to show the world that I can outbox Mike Tyson prove everyone wrong and show that I will be the one doing the killing.""

Despite how his body feels though Tyson gave Paul a fair warning.

""Once he‚Äôs in that ring"" Tyson said ""he has to fight like his life depends on it because it will be.""

Paul is 9-1 in his career with his lone loss being via decision to Tommy Fury.

Muse,"CAPE ELIZABETH ‚Äì Chadwick S. Muse 92 of Cape Elizabeth passed away on May 10 2024 with his loving wife of 68 years by his side and holding his hand.

Chad was born in 1931 and raised in Connecticut. It was a hard upbringing with many challenges. As the only boy and a father incapacitated by multiple sclerosis he learned about hard work and responsibility. As a youth he spent two years at the St. Thomas Church in NYC. These years as a choirboy would impact him profoundly instilling a strong moral character that would serve him well in business and at home.

Despite the trials of his upbringing Chad would go on to live an extremely adventurous and rich life. In the 1950‚Äôs he served four years in the United States Air Force. During his service he was stationed in Germany where he became a weatherman ‚Äì a skill he would use for the rest of his life as he looked to the sky.

Upon discharge Chad took advantage of the GI Bill and left for Boston where he would attend university in the day and drive a cab at night. It was in Boston that he and his wife Jackie first settled and where he would begin his 30-year career with IBM. His work with the company led him to many interesting assignments including four years in Paris and four in Hong Kong but ultimately the biggest gift was his move to Maine in 1974 where he would maintain a residence for the rest of his life.

While Maine was home his love for France was deep. Prior to his assignment ending in Paris Chad made the bold decision to buy an 800-year-old home in a charming village called Lorgues in the South of France. Here he and Jackie would spend time each year hosting friends and family and showing them the wonders of Provence. Beyond France and Hong Kong Chad travelled the world visiting every continent but Antarctica.

Chad also loved the ocean and in the late 1960‚Äôs true to his adventurous spirit he purchased an old wooden sailboat a yawl called Tradewinds. For a number of years he would take his family on weeks long trips visiting Block Island Nantucket Martha‚Äôs Vineyard and cruising Long Island sound.

In the winter months Chad took to the mountains to ski where he would navigate the slopes into his 80‚Äôs. Many memories were made in the beautiful mountains of New England and Colorado.

Upon retirement Chad purchased a small home in Morehead City North Carolina where he and Jackie would spend winter months before returning for another glorious summer in Maine. It was only in the last few years that the long drive between the two states became too much and he took up permanent residence in Cape Elizabeth. Looking out over the everchanging beauty of Kettle Cove and Richmond Island he was at peace to live his final years playing weekly bridge golfing marveling at and feeding the birds and hosting family and friends.

Chad was a selfless man devoted to his family and found deep contentment in the happiness of others. He was a loving kind humble man who we will miss dearly. On the evening of his passing two Canada geese flew by his window and the Aurora Borealis made a rare appearance. We were blessed to have him in our lives.

He is survived by his wife Jackie sons Calvin and partner Angela Rodney and wife Saerah and Brier and a large extended family of loving grandchildren.

The family is forever grateful for the support of our wonderful friends neighbors and caregivers.

A celebration of life will be held on Saturday May 18 from 4 to 6 p.m. at the Muse Family residence in Cape Elizabeth.

It‚Äôs cool to see RWM people who have never met each other in-person before solidify the relationships they‚Äôve begun building on Slack and Zoom and Google Meet. I heard Marc Andreessen tell Joe Rogan that this is what the concept of work is going to be turning into over the coming years ‚Äì a lot of stuff is done remotely and then the business invests in travel and meet-ups and retreats instead of physical office space. The upside is that people don‚Äôt take each other for granted when they finally do get together in real life ‚Äì it feels celebratory not like ‚Äúanother day at the office.‚Äù

I believe this to be accurate we are seeing it happen in our business and it‚Äôs beautiful. It also allows us to hire the very best and brightest people from all over America not just the best available people who happen to be local. I think this is game-changing for small and midsize businesses who are ready to scale and get creative.

A marriage is about two individuals but the wedding ceremony is a coming together of two different families and their guests. Food is a huge and critical part of every wedding ceremony and at times can lead to heated discussions. Families want to serve the most memorable food as let‚Äôs be honest most of us attend weddings for the feast.

Shruthi and Abhishek were already following a vegan lifestyle when they decided to get married. It felt only natural to want the festivities to also celebrate their life choices and values. They wished to use it as an opportunity to start a conversation about a vegan lifestyle. At a South Indian Brahmin wedding food served is always vegetarian but with a generous and sometimes hidden use of milk curd and ghee.

Vegan First spoke to the newly weds Shruthi and Abhishek to understand how they pulled off a big Tamizh-Kannadiga wedding ceremony spread over three days with lavish vegan feasts throughout.

Let‚Äôs start with a little about both of you.

Shruthi: I am a software engineer. I work with Amazon in Seattle.

Abhishek: I also work in Seattle work for Salesforce. We've both been in the US for 7 years now. We went to same grad school. Moved to different cities then reconnected and found that we bonded. Started off as a long distance thing‚Äîshe on the West Coast me on the East Coast‚Äîbut we made it work.

Were you always vegan? Or is that a newer journey?

Shruthi: It‚Äôs (relatively) new. We‚Äôve been vegetarian all our lives so the transition has been easier I should think. We‚Äôve been vegan for a year.

Abhishek: We‚Äôve had conversations about going vegan for about 6 years. I feel bad looking back now about not becoming vegan sooner. Because of COVID and not having to go to office we‚Äôve been able to make this a shared experience.

Shruthi: We have struggled with different products personally during the transitions. I struggled with yogurt/curd.

Abhishek: For me I couldn't give up whey protein as I couldn‚Äôt find an alternative. And plant based proteins didn‚Äôt suit me as I have a gastrointestinal problem.

What was the reason you both went vegan?

Abhishek: A little of everything‚Äîsustainability ethicalness and health‚Ä¶But I‚Äôm much more of a staunch ethical vegan. Shruthi is more of a practical vegan. She looks at it from all angles but for me even if it‚Äôs not bad for the environment you should still be vegan.

Shruthi: At the start of COVID I was reading a lot about climate change so that played a big motivator. And the facts about animal cruelty was also a big one.

What about the idea of a vegan food at the wedding‚Ä¶ was that natural or something you needed to think through?

Abhishek: In traditional South Indian weddings they use a lot of dairy. It didn‚Äôt sit right that we were going to spend lakhs of rupees on dairy food. From the start of the planning process we insisted that we need to try our best to make this a wedding one with vegan food. In South India there have been trailblazers before us but the pathways weren‚Äôt as well established as we would have liked it to be. It‚Äôs certainly been a challenge but I‚Äôm glad we persevered.

Was the main idea to be plant based or/and sustainable environmentally friendly?

The main idea was to focus on a vegan meal. Our message was about animal cruelty. We felt that would get people to consider it and maybe switch. They often don‚Äôt know how they are hurting animals. We did get the caterer to also segregate the waste and compost. But that wasn‚Äôt the focus.

So you decided to have a huge vegan feast at the wedding but was it easy?

Abhishek: For the longest time there were no vendors we could find in the South or they were all in North India and they couldn't figure out the transportation logistics. This was a huge hurdle. We were in the US so was hard to find vendors and get contacts. In the last one month or so we found vendors in Chennai. They all came together locally with quality products and at a great price.

Special call out to Wegun‚Äîrun by a couple Umamaheswari and Jaya Surya. Just a few weeks before the wedding when we were still struggling we got their contact from Mr. Aravindan of Vijay Sweets Coimbatore. They are some of the kindest and most earnest people you will ever meet. After getting to know them our menu actually expanded. They brought a lot to the table and gave us a lot of confidence.

Tell us about the feast you served at the wedding but firstly the challenges!

Abhishek: When we approached several leading caterers in Chennai with our proposal most turned us down as they'd either never heard of veganism or felt they didn't have the know-how. Some felt that using vegan alternatives to traditional dairy products would negatively impact the quality of the food and feared their reputation would take a hit. For the few that agreed to take on the challenge we relied on our families to go to these caterers for 'taste tests' to evaluate their attempts at vegan traditional South Indian food.

We approached Vinayaka Catering services. They are also one of the big players in the summer wedding space. We spoke with Mr. Sriram and from the outset he was totally open. He was worried about his reputation but willing to experiment as he'd never done a vegan wedding before.

Shruthi: His (Abhishek‚Äôs) parents had visited us in the States and we had started the conversation about serving vegan food at the wedding. Since there were with us they were exposed and knew the products available. With my parents it was more challenging because they have not been exposed at all. The products available in India are vastly different from the ones in the US. Without knowing the concept fully or ever having tasted vegan products my parents were the ones who had to go for tastings with caterers who were willing to take on the challenge.

Tell me about what all you served at your vegan feasts and the high-points!

We had a three day wedding. We served a variety of dishes you would see at any South Indian wedding. There was all the traditional food with the regular side dishes on the banana leaf. We experimented a bit at the reception.

We sourced ice cream from a vegan ice cream supplier in Chennai called Baba Ramdev run by Ashok Kumar. They take a mango or an orange scoop it out mix in icecream and put it back. We had guests eating two to three servings.

We had the opportunity prior to the wedding to eat at The Viridian Plate Chennai's only all-vegan restaurant. After being blown away by the food and the warmth of owners Gayathri and Shankar we decided to order something from them for the wedding too. They helped supply us with delicious Chocolate Mousse and a Pumpkin Kheer.

Shruthi: We even served chaas/buttermilk through the three days. Vinayaka even made the bakshanam‚Äîthe sweets and savoury items given to the guests as they leave the wedding on the last day‚Äîwithout any dairy using vegan alternatives. It turned out really great.

Crumbheaven is a bakery in Chennai that creates custom all-vegan cakes for events and ceremonies. Ms. Smuruthi who runs the business was incredibly kind to take our order on short notice and created an amazing black-forest tiered cake for us!

So how did your guests react?

Shruthi: For a couple of meals I was actually going to my cousins and asking them if they liked the food did they find anything different? Everyone was taken aback by my question because they didn't even realise that things had been substituted. They couldn‚Äôt tell the difference. That was important for us.

Abhishek: We didn‚Äôt want to give any room for people to be like oh this could have been better.

We had this huge flex banner at the entrance saying the food at the wedding was all vegan and explaining why it was important. Many were curious to see how it tasted. They wanted to go try everything on the menu. It did start a good conversation.

What was the BIG WOW from this experience?

Abhishek: Before the wedding I had relatives come to my parents and say if you are vegan you should get small amounts of food made just for you let the rest of us eat normal. That has changed after the wedding. It was very successful.

Some of the guests who came to our wedding started talking about Veganism. They didn't even know what it was before. Now they are seeing vegan options available to them in food. My sister is vegan but was skeptical that an Indian wedding feast could be vegan but now she has seen it happen.

Tips for others who wish to have a vegan wedding: Go Local!

Abhishek: Try to source as locally as possible because there are a lot of family businesses trying to gain a foothold in the vegan market. These local providers are often very friendly and accommodating.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN25ld3MuY29tL2hpZ2gtc3BlZWQtcmFpbC1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWF1dGhvcml0eS1zYW4tZnJhbmNpc2NvLWpvc2Utbm9ydGhlcm4tcm91dGUvMTIxNDY3OTcv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmM3bmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2hpZ2gtc3BlZWQtcmFpbC1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWF1dGhvcml0eS1zYW4tZnJhbmNpc2NvLWpvc2Utbm9ydGhlcm4tcm91dGUvMTIxNDY3OTcv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,High-Speed Rail Bay Area: California Authority board approves final environmental impact report for San Francisco to San Jose,"The California High-Speed Rail Authority approved the final Environmental Impact Report for an extension from San Francisco to San Jose.

The California High-Speed Rail Authority approved the final Environmental Impact Report for an extension from San Francisco to San Jose.

SAN JOSE Calif. -- The California high speed rail governing board approved the final environmental documents Thursday for the San Jose-to-San Francisco section completing clearance of the project's Northern California leg.

The California High-Speed Rail Authority's Board of Directors approved the environmental impact report and statement for the roughly 50-mile stretch which will utilize the right-of-way currently used by Caltrain.

High speed rail officials have now approved the environmental clearance documents for 420 miles of the project's 500-mile span between San Francisco and Anaheim.

""If nothing else what it does is it really prepares and moves this entire project forward towards construction with of course a very important component of generating capital that's necessary to get the job done"" board Chair Tom Richards said. ""But for the state of California it really provides the basis for a project that's ready to do just that.""

The San Jose-to-San Francisco section of the project is expected to have three stops at the San Jose Diridon Station the Millbrae transit center and the Fourth and King Street Caltrain station. Once fully complete the section will be extended to terminate at the Salesforce Transit Center.

The High-Speed Rail Authority and Caltrain plan to collaborate to convert some at-grade rail crossings along Caltrain's right-of-way to safer above-grade rail crossings. Increased fencing will also be added to remaining at-grade crossings in an effort to prevent vehicles and pedestrians from accessing the tracks.

The project was kick-started in 2008 when voters approved a $9.95 billion bond measure to support a high-speed rail network linking Northern and Southern California which was initially projected to cost roughly $30 billion and be completed by 2030.

Since then the price tag has soared north of $100 billion and High-Speed Rail Authority officials have yet to determine where most of the funding will come from to complete the first phase connecting San Francisco and Anaheim let alone a second phase that would add spur connections between Merced and Sacramento and Los Angeles and San Diego.

Construction has steadily moved along in recent years though with a 119-mile stretch between Madera and Wasco in the Central Valley on track to be the project's first completed section in the next year.

That section will then be extended to include Merced and Bakersfield. That full 175-mile section is expected to be operational by the end of the decade according to rail authority officials.

While the source of funding for the Merced to San Francisco section is to be determined the environmental clearance will enable final design work and construction to begin immediately once funding is secured.

""We look forward to working with all of our regional partners and stakeholders in developing modern sustainable transportation infrastructure completing our work in the Central Valley and connecting to the Bay Area as soon as possible"" Richards said.

Local officials say downtown is recovering much faster than is indicated by a national study which looked at only part of downtown.

Residents are moving in. Events and unique businesses are drawing people in on weeknights and weekends.

But the return of office workers is lagging behind in Cleveland and elsewhere and that pillar of downtown‚Äôs economy may be forever changed.

‚ÄúWe have to pivot‚Äù said Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb. ‚ÄúWe are not going to see a large majority of the workforce working downtown five days a week. I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs the new normal.‚Äù

How is Cleveland‚Äôs recovery going by the numbers

Bibb and Michael Deemer CEO of the Downtown Cleveland Alliance said downtown has seen positive headwinds to be optimistic about.

The area saw 4.14 million visits in June a 77% recovery compared to pre-pandemic numbers according to the DCA‚Äôs monthly reports. Downtown now has about 20500 residents adding 1500 during the pandemic Bibb said. And there‚Äôs a net gain of more than 40 new small businesses.

Visits to downtown offices were lower in June at 60% of pre-pandemic levels although Deemer said the national average is just 50%. Office traffic in downtown Cleveland was at 52% in May.

In May the DCA and city launched several events like pop-up block parties and live music and a new campaign to attract workers.

This all shows that Downtown Cleveland is doing better than recent national research would suggest Deemer and Bibb said.

A report from Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California Berkeley which looked at 62 cities pegged downtown Cleveland as one of the slowest to recover ahead of only San Francisco. But it didn‚Äôt look at all of Cleveland‚Äôs downtown.

Deemer said and researchers confirmed that the study only looked at the 44114 Zip Code which is mostly area north of Euclid Avenue and east of Public Square. It didn‚Äôt include the JACK Cleveland Casino Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse or the Warehouse District.

The DCA‚Äôs definition of downtown stretches much farther and includes the Flats.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the study tells us anything useful about downtown Cleveland because it excludes so much‚Äù Deemer said.

The map shows the area the U.C. Berkeley study determined was downtown versus the area the Downtown Cleveland Alliance measures as downtown. The U.C. Berkeley study in red painted a more grim picture of downtown than locally conducted studies.Courtesy of the City of Cleveland

Karen Chapple lead author of the study said zip codes aren‚Äôt always an exact fit for downtowns.

‚ÄúIf I were studying downtown Cleveland alone I might define it differently‚Äù she said in an email. ‚ÄúBut when I‚Äôm comparing it (to) 61 other cities it is the most apples-to-apples approach out there.‚Äù

Both the national study and the DCA‚Äôs study used cellphone data. Deemer said DCA is also looking at security card swipes at offices.

The U.C. Berkeley study said Cleveland‚Äôs recovery was at 36%. Deemer and others said that figure was far too low.

Business owners say the lack of office workers is noticeable

But the lack of office workers has been noticeable said Laurie Torres owner of Mallorca on West Ninth Street and president of Cleveland Independents an organization of locally owned and operated restaurants.

She said unless there‚Äôs a baseball game at Progressive Field or show at Playhouse Square people aren‚Äôt coming downtown. And the midday foot traffic has taken a hit.

‚ÄúThe only reason I stay open for lunch is because we‚Äôre 26 years old and we have customers that have been coming for 26 years.‚Äù Torres said.

Torres said she blames a lack of office workers and the lack of vibrant shopping centers a role Tower City and the Galleria used to fill she said.

She said the DCA has done a good job of creating excitement but says it won‚Äôt be enough to attract people who prefer working from home.

‚ÄúNo one is going to leave from home to come downtown for lunch in the square‚Äù Torres said.

Deemer said restaurants have changed their hours with some not opening for lunch. It‚Äôs sort of a chicken or egg issue but he said they‚Äôll need to up foot traffic during lunch hours before restaurants open.

Doug Price CEO of K&D Group one of the largest landlords in downtown Cleveland said the office market is also concerned. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing major employers downsizing‚Äù he said.

KeyBank recently subleased space in the Higbee building to Sherwin-Williams according to a report from the Cleveland Business Journal. Insurance giant Progressive Corp. though not downtown recently put several buildings up for sale near its Mayfield campus.

‚ÄúI just worry about the future because I hear rumblings about when leases are up a lot of people are talking about downsizing‚Äù Price said.

His larger tenants he said are having a hard time convincing employees to come back to the office.

Price said Cleveland needs to attract new large employers to fill office space. Deemer said keeping offices full is a focus for the DCA but in the wake of COVID-19 retention of current employers and attracting back current employees has taken precedence.

Baiju Shah president and CEO of the Greater Cleveland Partnership said employers are caught in a balancing act. Some want to bring employees to the office more often while a number of the employees want to continue to work from home at least part time.

Where are The Workers a study sponsored by Fund for Our Economic Future and others polled close to 5000 working age adults in Northeast Ohio and showed there‚Äôs a desire for a new normal.

Just 56.2% of workers surveyed said they worked fully from an office or workplace but only 36.7% of workers said they want to be in the workplace full-time and 45.9% said they want to work fully or mostly from home.

The study also found that for every five workers currently employed one of them plans to quit in the next 12 months and 2-in-5 said they‚Äôll look for a new job.

‚ÄúThat balancing is still going on especially in the tight labor market we still are in‚Äù Shah said.

Downtown‚Äôs future

Bibb said there‚Äôs been positive momentum but acknowledged there‚Äôs a long way to go. Early in his term he said he brought together the DCA GCP and key executives across town to work together on downtown.

He said the city needs to reactivate public spaces. That includes new special events at areas such as Playhouse Square or Mall C. It also includes upgrading infrastructure.

Deemer said making downtown more vibrant includes upgrading sidewalks adding bike lanes keeping the area clean and safe and a host of other things.

He said areas with more offices may see more challenges. But downtown for the most part will rise together.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to sugarcoat it‚Äù Deemer said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot more work to do. We‚Äôre not satisfied. We need to continue bringing workers back in. But a lot of our focus at DCA is the downtown experience overall.‚Äù

Bibb said the future of downtown Cleveland is a place where people can live work and play. It can‚Äôt become what it was before the pandemic he said.

Torres of Mallorca said COVID-19 accelerated some trends that were already happening. She said she expects workers to eventually stop working from home and is thrilled that Sherwin-Williams picked Public Square for its headquarters.

She stressed a healthy downtown‚Äôs importance to the rest of Cleveland.

‚ÄúIf the middle crumbles that means the box is hollow and everything else is going to crumble too‚Äù Torres said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL2NsYXNzaWZpZWRzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL3JldHJvLWJvbGQtY29sb3JzLXI4cHAxMTVi0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2RheS5jb20vYW1wL2NsYXNzaWZpZWRzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL3JldHJvLWJvbGQtY29sb3JzLXI4cHAxMTVi?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to get a retro-inspired look with bold colors,"By definition primary colors are the most basic of hues. When mixed together these elementary colors form every other shade on the color wheel but no other colors can be blended to create red yellow or blue. The primaries represent the most intense purest forms of color and this vibrant combination is beginning to establish itself as one of this year's top color trends.

The playful palette received a shoutout in Sherwin-Williams' color trend forecast for 2022 and primary colors appeared prominently in Pantone's predictions for next spring and summer. This resurgence of primary colors broadly used throughout the postmodern movement of the 1980s reflects a general fondness for throwback styles we've seen across interior design fashion and pop culture.

Because of their intensity decorating with primary colors can be tricky. To learn the strategies to pull off this daring combination we tapped a few designers for their go-to strategies. Use these tips to stylishly decorate with a primary color scheme.

1. Use subtle variations

In their original form primary colors can be a bit jarring. For a subtle take on this trend Texas-based interior designer Kim Armstrong suggests using variations of primary colors in a looser interpretation. For example swap in turquoise for true blue or use metallic gold finishes in place of yellow. Experiment with different shades to put your own spin on this classic color scheme.

2. Select one color

Instead of using each of the three colors equally throughout the space designate one as the star and consider the others supporting players suggests Mark Lavender a Chicago interior designer. Apply yellow as the wall color for instance then bring blue and red through furniture throw pillows wall art and other decorative accessories. Or select one red statement piece and accent it with small hits of yellow and blue.

3. Tone down with neutrals

Balance the brightness of primary colors with soft neutrals. ""I like to pair them with calmer more subdued color tones such as white gray and browns"" says Eddie Maestri a Dallas-based interior designer. Start with a foundation of white walls to make primary-colored accents pop or soften their vibrancy with soothing grays and warm wood tones.

4. Boost sophistication with texture

Primary colors bring energy and brightness to interiors but they often lack the sophistication of other palettes. To add richness and depth Armstrong suggests decorating with lots of texture. For pillows throws and upholstered furniture select tactile fabrics such as plush velvet buttery leather or nubby linen. Rich wood finishes and natural materials like stone or rattan can also introduce a more elegant feel.

5. Bring in bold patterns

Match the energy of a primary color scheme with patterns that feel equally bold and playful. Maestri likes using simple geometric patterns for a subtle nod to postmodernism. Armstrong on the other hand suggests incorporating floral motifs.

Scheels which counts aquariums arcade games and an indoor Ferris wheel among its attractions intends to raze the mall‚Äôs former Sears location and construct a 250000-square-foot store that could open by the fall of 2024 said Casey Stowe senior vice president of finance and real estate for PartnerTulsa the city‚Äôs economic development organization.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge investment‚Äù Stowe said. ‚ÄúWe think it will not only lift up the mall but lift up the entire retail corridor by the traffic it will drive. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a regional draw. We should be drawing from really the entire Green Country region.‚Äù

The company plans to employ 450-500 people 40% of whom will be full-timers Stowe said. Mall owner Simon Property Group is a leading partner on the project which is contingent upon incentives that must be approved by the Tulsa City Council a city official said.

The City Council on Wednesday will consider a resolution declaring the intent to consider approval of a project plan and creation of a new sales tax increment financing district. The resolution will begin creating the legal framework to allow the city to capture a portion of the sales tax generated by the company for economic development.

‚ÄúThis is an incredible win for Tulsa and I am very excited to have Scheels a one-of-a-kind store come to our city‚Äù Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said in a statement. ‚ÄúWhen you think about the jobs this will create and the people who will be coming from all across the region to visit our city because of Scheels it‚Äôs just an incredible testament to the teamwork that went into making this happen.

‚ÄúI want to thank PartnerTulsa for helping Scheels find a way to expand their business into our state ‚Äî and I want to thank Simon Property Group for their persistence in ensuring that whatever went into the former Sears space was something that would be a major win for Tulsa and for the 71st and Memorial area.‚Äù

Scheels which is employee-owned offers retail choices in hunting fishing camping golfing biking men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs fashion and team sports. Among the brands it carries are Nike Under Armour Yeti and Traeger. The Tulsa store would be the company‚Äôs first in Oklahoma and 34th nationally.

‚ÄúI just think it‚Äôs an incredible opportunity for our region‚Äù said City Councilor Lori Decter-Wright who represents the district that includes Woodland Hills Mall. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited that they want to be in Oklahoma and they chose Tulsa for their first store.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just going to be a great re-energizer for that corridor. Malls and retail in general have been on the decline and certainly with COVID and everyone going to more online (shopping) this is going to be the next revitalization to that area.‚Äù

Sears was among Woodland Hills‚Äô anchor stores when the mall opened in 1976. Sears closed that location after filing bankruptcy in late 2018. The site‚Äôs current occupant Overstock Furniture & Mattress has posted signs that it is closing.

The proposed store would abut District 8 where Phil Lakin serves as city councilor.

‚ÄúScheels is a game-changing addition to Tulsa‚Äôs largest sales-tax-generating corridor‚Äù he said by phone. ‚ÄúFinancially this investment will provide substantial revenue to support public safety and fix streets. Equally as important is the unique experience Scheels will bring to this area which needs continual reinvestment so people from all across the region will want to visit to shop eat and simply have fun.‚Äù

The Pleasanton City Council approved a request from staff to move forward with the planning process for the Stoneridge Shopping Center redevelopment framework on Tuesday.

The framework allows staff to start preparing for mixed-use plans for the mall property including outlines for the proposed 900 to 1400 affordable housing units that could be developed as part of the 2023-31 Housing Element update.

‚ÄúI say this is the biggest shift in retail in the city of Pleasanton‚Äù Pleasanton Mayor Karla Brown said during the council meeting. ‚ÄúThis is major.‚Äù

Council members also provided input on housing redevelopment plans for part of the Stoneridge Shopping Center site and expressed the need for careful review of traffic and safety impacts to the surrounding neighborhoods.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm concerned that there‚Äôs nothing drilling in here to make sure we understand the impacts to the neighborhood to the south there ‚Äî traffic schools the public safety again‚Äù said Councilmember Kathy Narum who lives in the surrounding area.

Council members had included the mall in its 2023-31 Housing Element site list to serve as a location to develop high-density housing units that could be developed if rezoning as contemplated is approved.

The Housing Element is anticipated to be adopted by April or May giving staff approximately six to eight months to gather community input outline allowed land-uses and provide initial policy guidance and conceptual planning for the mall property.

Staff will initially focus on the ‚Äúinner‚Äù mall area including the mall buildings and surrounding parking fields. Planning efforts will include gathering background information on the site understanding all of the opportunities and constraints that exist and looking for inspiration in similar projects that have been developed around the country according to city officials.

‚ÄúThe expectation is that we will take the information the guidance from this framework effort and use that to springboard into a more detailed specific plan because there‚Äôs a lot more that will need to be fleshed out and explored in that process as a second phase effort‚Äù said Ellen Clark the city‚Äôs community development director.

One main area of concern the council gave input on apart from wanting to see more traffic impact reports was wanting to see more discussion on school overcrowding.

Councilmember Julie Testa said she received feedback from residents who were concerned the additional housing will add more students to the already overcrowded school in the area like Lydiksen Elementary School.

Clark said that staff will continue to work with the Pleasanton Unified School District so that they are aware of the situation and that the environmental impact report that is reviewing the Housing Element site list will also review those impacts to the schools.

Councilmember Jack Balch said that he mainly wants staff to look into the traffic impacts of the rezoning project proposed by Simon Property Group which owns most of the nearly 75-acre parcel. The project which was part of the last housing cycle plan would create about 10 acres for high-density housing and one 360-unit project is currently in the review process.

He said with the project recently seeking a density bonus which would bring the number of units to about 480 traffic could get out of control and it is something staff needs to consider.

Clark said that traffic analysis will look at a range of intersections around the mall to understand those impacts and broadly feed those into a traffic model that will be brought to the council at a later time.

Council members also said they wanted to see evaluations on where the city could add open space for children to play to design the area into a family friendly open space.

‚ÄúChildren are staying home especially during COVID‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre home with their family more than ever before ‚Ä¶ so let‚Äôs make it family-friendly.‚Äù

One of the other key points made by the council was to prioritize public input and make sure that everyone that would be affected in the area is noticed so they can participate in community outreach events that staff will facilitate.

That point was echoed by Dean Wallace a resident and council candidate who lives across from the mall who said he has spoken with various neighbors who all support reimagining what the mall will look like but only if it is done right.

‚ÄúThey want to make sure that it‚Äôs done right and I share that desire‚Äù Wallace said. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a lot of anxiety concern and a bit of confusion about the various different plans that the city is currently considering.‚Äù

He said there should be more community outreach being done to inform the public about the framework process and what the timeline for the redevelopment will look like. Wallace is currently a candidate running for the City Council District 1 seat which represents the Stoneridge area.

Another reason staff wanted to start on the framework process and complete it prior to the adoption of the Housing Element was parcel owners in the mall interested in moving forward with specific development proposals in the near future.

Various mall property owners have expressed interest in redeveloping existing vacant retail space in recent years especially since Sears and Nordstrom left and other parcels like JCPenney have changed ownership.

Jerry Hunt founder and managing Partner at 300 Venture Group which just bought JCPenney spoke at the meeting and said he supported the framework and the emphasis on staff reaching out to the other parcel owners to work together on redevelopment plans.

‚ÄúThe one thing that we wanted to just register is that while it‚Äôs wonderful the city has been proactive about this probably the biggest obstacle to reconcile is that there are more than one owner at the mall‚Äù Hunt said. ‚ÄúWe would encourage that the process and the framework frontload the involvement of the owners.‚Äù

He said that is why there should be a big emphasis on mixed use and allowing for flexibility on residential or commercial use expansions.

‚ÄúI think for the developers involved there‚Äôs value in ‚Ä¶ having this as a very pedestrian-friendly vibrant mixed use type of place that‚Äôs really a destination type of place‚Äù Vice Mayor Valerie Arkin said.

The council approved to allocate $176400 from its general fund contingency to cover the consultant costs of the related contracts for financial analysis traffic and transportation analysis and urban design and planning costs.

Clark said staff will work within the short timeframe to develop a final framework plan for approval around the same time that the Housing Element is being finalized.

‚ÄúPlanning in Pleasanton tends to stretch out‚Äù Clark said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to do this in a relatively abbreviated period so that we can get it done and have some I‚Äôll just call them guardrails on future development. Particularly as we rezone or contemplate rezoning for housing in particular at the mall.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9hdGxhbnRhL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9saWZlLXRpbWUtYXRobGV0aWMtZmFjaWxpdHktb3BlbmluZy1waGlwcHMtcGxhemEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'It's a destination': Life Time aims to continue rebound with Phipps debut in September - Atlanta Business Chronicle,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2022/08/21/life-time-athletic-facility-opening-phipps-plaza.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9hdGxhbnRhL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9saWZlLXRpbWUtYXRobGV0aWMtZmFjaWxpdHktb3BlbmluZy1waGlwcHMtcGxhemEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

West Stanly‚Äôs varsity football team entered Friday‚Äôs season opener with South Stanly having won the last eight seasons against the Bulls.

Hosting South Friday West took advantage of turnovers and mistakes to stretch the win streak over South to nine with a 45-0.

The shutout for West (1-0) was the third time the Colts blanked South Stanly in the last nine years. The shutout was also the first since the shortened 2020 season.

The Colts limited the Bulls (0-1) to 37 total net yards of offense and three first downs two of which came on penalties.

West running backs Matthew Parker and Shane Mecimore scored two rushing touchdowns each as the Colts finished with 221 net yards on 26 carries averaging 8.5 yards per rush. Mecimore finished with 112 yards on just four carries including a 59-yard scamper to the end zone while Parker added 84 yards on nine carries.

The Colts also got passing touchdowns from starting quarterback Carson Morton and backup Jett Thomas. Both TD passes were hauled in by West wideout J.T. Barbee.

South lost two fumbles in the game and had a bad snap on a punt deep in the Bulls‚Äô territory which set up a short scoring drive. The Bulls also were whistled for 97 yards on 11 penalties while West had four penalties for 50 yards.

‚ÄúI just give credit to all the linemen out there‚Äù Parker said about the West running game. ‚ÄúThey contribute a lot. I just follow the players and run.‚Äù

Parker‚Äôs first touchdown saw the senior get out in the open field in a one-on-one situation with a South defender. Parker faked and got past the defender en route to the end zone.

‚ÄúI just try to be a little shifty sometimes‚Äù Parker said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at the end zone; that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù

West head coach Brett Morton said converting turnovers and mistakes ‚Äúis Football 101. If you can force turnovers and capitalize normally you‚Äôll have a good night. We worked and worked to generate more opportunities for us to get the ball and it paid off tonight.‚Äù

The Colts coach added West executed well on offense in the first half and said the defense ‚Äúhad a good night‚Äù adding the West defenders ‚Äúgot off the ball fast and read their keys well.‚Äù

Morton recalled not being able to play the team‚Äôs first two home games last season because of COVID restrictions saying opening with a big win like West did Friday ‚Äúmeans everything to start as fast as we did and capitalize on the momentum moving forward.‚Äù

The second of West‚Äôs three county games this season will be right back at Larry Wagner Field this Friday when the Colts host Albemarle (0-1). The Bulldogs lost 14-0 at home Friday night to Thomasville.

The prequel to HBO's favorite series Games of Thrones premieres on August 21. To that end Snap and HBO Max released selfie and worldview lenses for Snapchat users.

""Back to Westeros @HBO with the ""House of Dragon"" Lens. Use this dual-facing Lens to see the @HouseofDragon fly through your skies then bring out your inner Targaryen and become a dragon!"" wrote Snap on Twitter.

According to the footage that Snap provided you can use this AR lens using two cameras on your smartphone namely the front and rear cameras.

If you use the front camera for a selfie you will see an effect that will turn your face into a dragon and when you open your mouth you will let out fire like a real dragon.

Meanwhile if you use the rear camera and face it to the sky you will see a dragon from the House of the Dragon series flying above your head.

Snap says that the Lens will be available worldwide including in Australia Europe India Middle East North Africa North America and many more. But unfortunately when VOI tried it on Snapchat the effect was still not available for users in Indonesia.

According to TechCrunch for Landmarker Lenses Snap and HBO Max have coordinated with Lens makers from around the world to build custom AR experiences in their local markets.

If you‚Äôre wondering if it‚Äôs worth the switch we‚Äôll outline what‚Äôs possible right now.

If you haven‚Äôt noticed the arrival of Snapchat Plus for $US4 ($6) per month $US22 ($31) every six months or $US40 ($56) a year you can get a few extras that normal users don‚Äôt get: As well as access to Snapchat on the web there‚Äôs the option to pin one of your friends to the top of the chat list a choice of exclusive Snapchat icons for your home screen custom Bitmoji backgrounds and a few more perks.

OK it‚Äôs not the most appealing subscription package right now but Snapchat is promising to add more features over time ‚Äî and if you spend a lot of time in the app (and want to be able to spend a lot of time on it in your browser too) you might consider it worth it. You also get priority replies to celebrities on Snapchat so your responses appear above everyone else‚Äôs.

Snapchat for Web lets you send snaps from your webcam. (Screenshot: Snapchat)

Web access is perhaps the most interesting of the Snapchat Plus features that have been announced so far. As demonstrated by Instagram ‚Äî another mobile-first app that now has a web interface ‚Äî being able to cover your social media duties while sat at a computer can be a lot more convenient. You‚Äôve got a bigger screen to look at you‚Äôve got a proper keyboard to type on and you can more easily switch back and forth from other tasks.

Once you‚Äôve paid your dues for Snapchat Plus you need to head to Snapchat for Web log in using your credentials confirm your login on your phone in the Snapchat app and then you‚Äôre ready to go. Click Turn on your camera to send Snaps to give the site permission to use your computer‚Äôs webcam.

You‚Äôll see you can start composing a text message just by clicking on someone‚Äôs name in the chat list on the left or by clicking the compose button in the top left corner (the blue and white one). This is actually one of the best uses of Snapchat for Web especially if you‚Äôve got a lot of typing to do to individual contacts or to groups. You can send message reactions and save messages in the chat once you‚Äôre in a conversation.

You can make calls and send text snaps. (Screenshot: Snapchat)

Snapchat for Web lets you make audio and video calls too: When you‚Äôre inside a chat you‚Äôll see the buttons up in the top right corner. You can also use the same compose button that‚Äôs available for text messages only when you‚Äôve picked out a contact click on Start Call instead of Chat.

What you can‚Äôt do at the moment ‚Äî and we‚Äôre assuming this will have to change pretty soon to make the service worth it ‚Äî is open up pictures and video that you‚Äôve been sent. You need to use the mobile app to view these snaps and even after you‚Äôve opened them they don‚Äôt appear in the web interface (though there is a placeholder showing if they‚Äôve been seen or not).

You can send photo snaps from the web interface once you‚Äôve granted access to your webcam ‚Äî but again you can‚Äôt actually view them in conversation threads. Only text overlays are available so no stickers or scribbles and unless you can only get a certain shot using your webcam you‚Äôre going to want to use the mobile app to compose and send snaps. At the moment it‚Äôs a pretty bare bones experience in that regard.

Snapchat for Web is most useful for text-heavy conversations. (Screenshot: Snapchat)

The same can be said for the settings on Snapchat for Web which you can open up by clicking on your avatar right up in the top left corner of the interface. You‚Äôre able to choose between a light and a dark theme or you can follow the load of whatever operating system you‚Äôre using and‚Ä¶ well that‚Äôs about it.

One other interesting observation worth making: The web interface recognises when you switch away to a different browser window or tab hiding whatever conversation you were looking at. It‚Äôs a neat security feature that might help you protect your chats from being viewed by someone else peering over your shoulder.

If you‚Äôre wondering if Snapchat for Web makes the Snapchat Plus subscription worth it right now the answer is probably not ‚Äî not unless you do a lot of texting through Snapchat and not until there‚Äôs better integration in terms of photo and video snaps in the browser app. There‚Äôs no doubt it‚Äôs going to get better over time though and more viable as an alternative to the mobile apps."

Because modern meteoric Œ¥2H correlates with seasonal temperature change in South Georgia and Lake Diamond water Œ¥2H integrates a somewhat enriched annual precipitation average (see Figs. 1c 2) we expect reconstructed values to capture changes in temperature and evaporative 2H-enrichment. To better constrain this paleo signal we disentangle the different plant sources producing our sedimentary n-alkanes and the environmental signals they record in the text below.

While aquatic photoautotrophs directly use lake water for biosynthesis35 terrestrial plants use soil moisture35 which is often isotopically skewed towards the growing season when biosynthesis occurs46 and differently impacted by evaporative enrichment than lake water4748. This is particularly true for closed (endorheic) basins like Lake Diamond due to their long water residence time20. To constrain these different Œ¥2H source signatures we differentiate between aquatic and terrestrial n-alkane producers. It has previously been argued that mid-chain (C 21 -C 25 ) n-alkane homologs are produced by aquatic plants whereas long-chain (C 27 -C 33 ) compounds typically derive from terrestrial vegetation4950. Recent studies have called this generalization into question515253. Here we rely on reported n-alkane distributions from representative terrestrial vegetation at nearby Grytviken to understand the sources of n-alkanes in Lake Diamond (Fig. 1a)54. Critically this selection comprises two species that dominate the Lake Diamond catchment today: tussock grass and greater burnet (see Fig. 3a). As can be seen in Fig. 4 mid-chain homologs are negligible in these terrestrial plants but abundant in sediment samples. This is in line with evidence from upwind southern Patagonia where these compounds are attributed to aquatic macrophytes55. We thus argue that mid-chain n-alkanes are primarily synthesized by aquatic producers in Lake Diamond. In this respect we note that moss patches in the catchment only contain traces of Sphagnum32‚Äîthe only peat-forming species synthesizing considerable amounts of mid-chain n-alkanes5657. The inference that mid- and long-chain homologs derive from different sources is supported by Principal Component Analysis (PCA: see methods). The ordination diagram of Fig. 5c separates these homologous groups on PC2. Based on these lines of reasoning we infer that mid- and long-chain n-alkanes derive from aquatic and terrestrial plants respectively.

Full size image

Down-core n-alkane Œ¥2H values can also be affected by vegetation shifts because of species-specific differences in apparent fractionation between source water and leaf waxes355859. To constrain vegetation changes in the catchment area over the past 7 ka we use palynological evidence and n-alkane Average Chain Length (ACL: see methods). The pollen data seen in Fig. 3a show that tussock grasses (Festuca contracta) and greater brunet (Acaena magellanica) have dominated terrestrial plant cover around Lake Diamond over the past 7 ka. The stable abundance of Callitriche antarctica and Montia fontana the only mid-chain n-alkane-synthesizing macrophytes preserved in the Diamond pollen record suggest aquatic vegetation also changed little60. Supporting this evidence both ACL values and concentrations of mid-chain (C 21 -C 25 ) and long-chain (C 27 -C 33 ) homologs fluctuate around a stable mean throughout our study period (Fig. 3a‚Äìc). Finally we find no relationship between n-alkane abundance and Œ¥2H values of various homologs indicating that the inferred minor vegetation changes do not explain changes in isotope values (Fig. 5a b).

Hydrogen isotope values of all analyzed n-alkanes are relatively stable on centennial timescales from the beginning of the Lake Diamond record until ~2150 cal. yr. BP (Fig. 6). Variability then visibly deviates from this long-term mean as also indicated by change-point analysis (see methods). Deviation from the long-term mean is primarily captured by hydrogen isotope values of mid-chain aquatic homologs (Œ¥2H aq ) which become progressively more positive. In contrast hydrogen isotope values of long-chain terrestrially derived homologs (Œ¥2H terr ) exhibit a different and more subdued response that does not significantly deviate from the long-term mean (Fig. 6b). As noted modern water samples from Lake Diamond are indistinguishable from amount-weighted annual precipitation Œ¥2H values which in turn track surface temperatures on South Georgia at seasonal timescales (Fig. 1c). Based on the calculated Œ¥2H-temperature dependence of 5.83‚Ä∞ ¬∞C‚àí1 (Fig. 2b) the observed ~100‚Ä∞ Œ¥2H aq shift to more positive values during the past two millennia would require ~17 degrees of warming. As local and regional temperature reconstructions reveal a shift towards moderately cooler annual (~1 ¬∞C) and growing season (~2 ¬∞C) conditions during this period (Fig. 6a)274461 this is highly implausible. Furthermore the dissimilarity between changes in Œ¥2H aq and Œ¥2H terr values suggests that at least one of these records does not simply reflect Œ¥2H values of precipitation. We also exclude large variations in precipitation seasonality: as the isotopic composition of soil moisture used by land plants is typically skewed towards the growing season when biosynthesis occurs62 the observed isotopic enrichment of Œ¥2H aq would also be captured by Œ¥2H terr if caused by an increase in less negative (relatively 2H-enriched) spring-summer precipitation (see Fig. 1c).

Full size image

We interpret the shift to more positive Œ¥2H aq values after ~2150 cal. yr BP to reflect an increase in evaporative enrichment of the lake water during this time. The observed positive shift in Œ¥2H aq values as well as their 2H-enrichment relative to Œ¥2Hter are both characteristic of basins with a negative water balance2047. As noted (see setting and approach) evaporation is often an important source of water loss in closed (endorheic) basin lakes like Lake Diamond6364. Because evaporative isotope enrichment can outweigh other environmental controls on Œ¥2H values in leaf waxes and because the positive hydrogen isotope shift during the past two millennia (the Common Era) is only recorded in Diamond Lake by lipids derived from aquatic plants that track lake water35 our interpretation provides an explanation for all of the observations without invoking unreasonable changes in temperature or the seasonality of precipitation. It also allays concerns that the incidental spills of glacial meltwater inferred by29 left a detectable imprint: as this water source is 2H-depleted65 substantial input would result in isotope changes in the opposite direction of what we observe in our record.

Based on the strong seasonal link between meteoric Œ¥2H and temperature in South Georgia (Figs. 1c 2b) and the tendency of terrestrial compounds to record precipitation Œ¥2H in small catchments like that of Lake Diamond66 we infer that down-core Œ¥2H terr values reflect temperature change. As seen in Fig. 6 this interpretation is supported by the fact that the most prominent feature of our Œ¥2H terr record‚Äîa ~20‚Ä∞ oscillation towards heavier isotopic values between 1200‚Äì600 cal. yr BP‚Äîcoincides with warming phase South Georgia273060.

To quantify the impact of lake water evaporation through time we calculate the isotopic difference between Œ¥2H terr (taken to reflect Œ¥2H of precipitation) and Œ¥2H aq (taken to reflect Œ¥2H of precipitation and evaporative enrichment of lake water) after20 subtracting Œ¥2H terr from Œ¥2H aq  and defining this parameter as Œµ terr-aq . We chose the C 29 and C 23 n-alkanes to represent terrestrial and aquatic lipids respectively based on their maximum separation along PC2 (Fig. 5c) and use their Œ¥2H values to calculate Œµ terr-aq change through time.

Due to core top sediment loss in LDP2 and extensive sub-sampling of LDS229 we have no measurements of Œ¥2H terr and Œ¥2H aq for the past 500 years (see Fig. 6). To extend our inferred evaporative enrichment reconstruction into this period which overlaps with notable regional climate transitions including negative and positive phases of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the culmination of the Little Ice Age (LIA)1267 we rely on proxy-to-proxy calibration68. Specifically we use sediment organic content (measured by loss on ignition or LOI) as a substitute for measured Œµ terr-aq values during this interval (see methods) based on (1) statistically significant (œÅ = 0.66 p < 0.001 n = 14) correspondence between these measurements (Fig. 7 and methods section) and (2) available LOI data from surface core LDS2 (Fig. 3b). We cannot be certain why this strong link between LOI and Œµ terr-aq exists but widespread evidence for contemporaneous climate deterioration argues against an increase in lake productivity (Fig. 6a c)2769. Vegetation change also seems an unlikely culprit as the previously discussed pollen evidence from Lake Diamond reveals that Holocene variability was minimal and unrelated to measured Œ¥D values (see section 2.1 and Figs. 3a 5b). Finally the non-significant anti-correlation (R2 = ‚àí0.03) between LOI and the mass-specific magnetic susceptibility (œábulk)-derived glacier reconstruction by29 allays concerns about the imprint of dilution with glacigenic clastic input during the investigated period. We hypothesize that the correlation between LOI and Œ¥2H aq values can be attributed to the impact of inferred lake evaporation on water levels: particularly in a shallow and conically-shaped basin like Lake Diamond29 low stands focus organic deposition into the center where our cores were extracted70. In support of this hypothesis we also observe a strong (œÅ = ‚àí0.52 p < 0.05 n = 13) correspondence in LDP2 between Œµ terr-aq and Pediastrum (Fig. 7)60. The abundance of this green algae genus is widely used as an indicator of lake level shallowing71 also in upwind southern Patagonia72. As Pediastrum synthesizes some mid-chain n-alkanes73 we should re-iterate that there is no relation between the abundance and isotopic value of these homologs in Lake Diamond (Fig. 5a).

For the latter purpose we excluded values (n = 7) from the ~2.4‚Äì2.7 ka BP to avoid closed-sum effects from dilution with alluvial clastic input during this time as reported by ref. 29.

Wind-driven evaporation during the past two millennia

We propose the inferred increase in evaporative water loss from Lake Diamond after ~2150 cal. yr BP was driven by strengthening winds. The previously discussed evidence for local and regional cooling at this time rules out direct temperature effects (Fig. 6a)274461. We also reject decreasing relative humidity as an explanation because such a change would be reflected by an increase in Œ¥2H ter values due to leaf water enrichment48 which we do not observe (Fig. 6b). Our interpretation is supported by macrofossil evidence from peatlands sensitive archives of sub-Antarctic surface water balance7475 which reveal a sharp transition ~2200 cal. yr BP towards colder wetter (humid) conditions in South Georgia (Fig. 6c).

Variations in wind strength can leave a measurable isotopic imprint on closed (endorheic) basins in the SWH core belt like Lake Diamond76. Nearby paleoclimate records indicate that wind strength indeed increased after ~2150 cal. yr BP when Œµ terr-aq began to deviate. A record from neighboring Annenkov Island shows an increase in the accumulation rates of long-distance transported (LDT) pollen‚Äîan established indicator of wind strength7778. Further upwind (52.5¬∞S and 72.6¬∞W) close to the Andean crest where strengthening of the westerlies is coupled to an increase in orographic precipitation79 the amount of hygrophytic pollen increased throughout the last two millennia80. A similar trend is observed in upwind Lago Guanaco (51.5¬∞S and 72.5 ¬∞W) where (1) a carbonate-derived Œ¥18O-based reconstruction of the balance between wind-driven precipitation and surface evaporation from Lago Guanaco is similar (œÅ = 0.53 p < 0.001 n = 35) to our inferred wind-driven evaporation record from Lake Diamond during the overlapping ~100‚Äì950 cal. yr BP period (Fig. 8)21 and (2) gradual wind-driven precipitation increases during this period are reflected by the dominance of forest over grassland40(Fig. 9d). We attribute the delayed response of the latter transition to the well-documented nonlinear relation between regional changes in vegetation and climate19.

Links to the southern annular mode (SAM)

The Lake Diamond Œµ terr-aq wind-driven lake evaporation reconstruction suggests that the past two millennia were characterized by major regional shifts in core belt SHW strength that appears unmatched in the past 7 ka. As seen in Figs. 8 9 the transition towards windier conditions seems to mark a major reorganization of the regional climate system as the pattern of change observed in Lake Diamond broadly coincides with (1) pronounced annual cooling towards a post-glacial temperature minimum off the northeastern Antarctic Peninsula (Fig. 9b)‚Äîrecorded by ice core Œ¥2H values from James Ross Island (Fig. 1a) and (2) extension of the sea ice season towards a Holocene maximum along the western Antarctic Peninsula (Fig. 9c) as indicated by a rise in sea ice diatom biomarker concentrations81. A concomitant increase in seabird-derived phosphorus (P) from a rookery on the Falklands also attests to the broad ecological impacts of these climatic changes (Fig. 9e)82. Sea ice cover and wind stress have a major impact on the sub-Antarctic food web through impacts on the transport of nutrient waters as well as productivity and feeding8384. This reconstructed pattern of coupled cooling mid-latitude westerly intensification and the Bellingshausen Sea ice expansion is diagnostic for a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode or SAM128586. The SAM is the main pattern of Southern Ocean climate variability9 and affects the strength and position of the SHW by modulating the atmospheric pressure gradient between 40‚Äì65¬∞S (see introduction). There is a strong correlation (Spearman‚Äôs correlation coefficient œÅ = 0.75 p < 0.0001 n = 35) between our inferred evaporation record and the sole annual SAM reconstruction that extends back to 1000 CE demonstrating that Lake Diamond sediments indeed capture shifts in the behavior of this dominant regional climate mode (Fig. 8)12. These also include the positive SAM trend‚Äîcharacterized by less windy conditions over Lake Diamond‚Äîduring the past 500 years. We thus argue that our reconstruction of wind-driven evaporation is linked to SAM variability over the past 7 millennia. However to acknowledge that links with SHW strength (1) depend on the choice of index and reanalysis data22 and (2) could be non-stationary through time13 we refer to SAM-like changes in the following paragraphs after85. Concretely we define these as changes in wind-driven evaporation that were likely driven by shifts in the meridional pressure gradient.

Positive modern SAM phasing was not unprecedented during Holocene

The Lake Diamond record provides valuable information concerning long-term SAM behavior. Notably the period from 7 ka BP until ~2150 cal. yr BP was comparatively stable and mostly characterized by positive SAM-like conditions (Fig. 9). Based on baseline data that do not extend beyond the past millennium13 it has been argued that today‚Äôs positive SAM phasing‚Äîis attributed to a combination of anthropogenic greenhouse forcing and ozone depletion1187‚Äîfalls outside the range of natural variability8. Our findings indicate that this may not be the case and that the negative SAM polarity of the past two millennia was exceptional rather than today‚Äôs positive phasing. While acknowledging the possibility that the relation between wind-driven evaporation in Lake Diamond and the SAM is non-stationary beyond the past millennium13 we use the relationship (R2 = 0.65 p = 0.000) between the Lake Diamond data and the SAM index by12 to approximate modern limits. Based on this basic calculation we find that Œµ terr-aq values greater than ‚àí45‚Ä∞ exceed the observed 1999 CE SAM maximum (Fig. 9a). Notwithstanding the uncertainties of this simple approach it highlights that SAM values have been near or exceeded observational limits during most of the Mid- to Late Holocene and underscores the potential of this period to better understand the impacts of a more positive SAM which is predicted for the future87. Our findings corroborate previous proxy-derived evidence that strongly positive SAM phases do not require anthropogenic radiative forcing1385. Taken together this body of work hints at the possibility that internal variations which will be super-imposed on future anthropogenic change but remain poorly resolved in climate models87 play a critical but undervalued role in driving SAM shifts.

Was SAM-like change driven by Northern Hemisphere cooling?

In the following discussion we examine whether the multi-centennial Common Era climate variations captured by the Lake Diamond record and other reconstructions of SAM-like change in Fig. 9 could have been caused by modes of internal variability. Specifically the El Ni√±o-southern oscillation or ENSO14. El Ni√±o events are associated with negative SAM phases because positive temperature anomalies in the Tropical Pacific trigger Rossby wave trains that propagate positive pressure differences poleward88. Conversely La Ni√±a events coincide with positive SAM phases as ensuing Tropical Pacific cooling leads to low sea-level pressure anomalies in the sub-Antarctic. Recently it has been shown that these connections also operate on centennial timescales17. However while the reconstructed SAM minimum ~500 cal. yr BP (Fig. 8) coincides with a phase of El Ni√±o-dominated conditions89 no consistent link exists between records of SAM-like variability and ENSO reconstructions90. Indeed there is growing consensus that ENSO-SAM links are non-stationary1391 and also depend on the strength of the latter92. In light of this evidence we note that the Common Era excursion captured in the Lake Diamond record and the other records of SAM-like change in Fig. 9 coincides with the onset of ENSO strengthening to a Holocene maximum9394. Such long-term trends are however often characterized as ENSO-like and attributed to other mechanisms that likewise affect tropical Pacific surface temperature change88.

There is for example mounting evidence for a global atmospheric teleconnection that is (1) considered analogous to ENSO as it also impacts equatorial convection but (2) driven by the temperature gradient between Earth‚Äôs hemispheres and (3) operating at the multi-centennial timescales resolved by our record95. The emerging observational model-based and proxy-derived evidence supporting this framework shows that differential extratropical temperature change increases poleward heat export to the cooler hemisphere969798. To facilitate this the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) moves into the warmer hemisphere so that more energy is transported across the equator99100. A similar response is observed during ENSO variations as the ITCZ migrates south into a warming South Pacific during El Ni√±o events and vice versa during La Ni√±a101. Critically model experiments reveal that this feedback also alters the strength and position of the core SHW belt through poleward Rossby wave train propagation102‚Äîa key characteristic of modern ENSO-SAM interactions88.

To assess whether this global atmospheric teleconnection may help explain the Common Era excursion observed in our isotope record and the other reconstructions of SAM-like change shown in Fig. 9 we focus on anticipated changes in ITCZ position and meridional temperature gradient95. In light of the presented shift towards anomalously negative SAM values (Figs. 8 9a) and the association of this state with El Ni√±o-like (negative ENSO) conditions88 these include evidence for a southward ITCZ migration in response to Northern Hemisphere cooling or Southern Hemisphere warming. Proxy evidence from the sensitive southern limit (15¬∞S) of the present-day South American ITCZ reveals major contemporaneous precipitation increases‚Äîthe main expression of such a shift103. As seen in Fig. 9f this is recorded by a sharp increase in freshwater plankton abundances in oligohaline Lake Titicaca from 2 ka BP onwards104. A transition from dry savanna to a wetter rain forest reflected by a sharp rise in Moraceae (mulberry) pollen ~2160 cal. yr BP in southern Amazonia (13‚Äì14¬∞S)105 also supports this interpretation. Both observations are in broad agreement with global evidence for a southward ITCZ migration during the Late Holocene in response to orbitally-driven Northern Hemisphere cooling96106. This trend was amplified during the last two millennia by the negative radiative effects of Arctic sea ice expansion107 and is identified as one of the major temperature shifts of the Holocene108. Recent proxy-validated simulations even identify this feedback as the main driver of global temperature change during the Common Era109.

As seen in Fig. 9g the evolution of this cooling mode tracks the millennial-scale trend of mid to late Holocene SAM-like variability in our study region and shows that cooling rates intensify around ~2100 cal. yr BP. To further investigate the correspondence between the Common Era SAM-like changes discussed here and (relative) Northern Hemisphere cooling we compare our Lake Diamond reconstruction and the millennium-long SAM index of12 to the temperature contrast between the extratropics (30‚Äì90¬∞) of both hemispheres (North minus South)‚Äîa measure of Earth‚Äôs meridional temperature gradient. To do so we rely on the area-weighted ensemble means of the 30¬∞ latitude average presented by110. Figure 8 underlines that the Northern Hemisphere cooled differentially during this period and reveals a notable degree of agreement (œÅ = 0.55 p < 0.000 n = 22) with coeval SAM-like changes.

Following the above we argue that the inferred shift towards a negative SAM-like state after ~2150 cal. yr BP is consistent with a change in Earth‚Äôs thermal gradient in response to amplified Arctic cooling. Our findings thus provide additional evidence for the existence of a previously hypothesized atmospheric teleconnection that links the high latitudes in both hemispheres and impacts SHW strength88. This raises the possibility that ongoing amplified Arctic warming may (1) reinforce the predicted trend towards a more positive phase of SAM87 and (2) impact the ability of the SHW to help regulate the global climate in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY2l0eW1lbnVzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL3JpY2gtc3RpbnNvbi1uYW1lZC1hcy1hLW1vc3QtYWRtaXJlZC1jZW8tcmVjaXBpZW50LWZyb20tYXRsYW50YS1idXNpbmVzcy1jaHJvbmljbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rich Stinson Named as a Most Admired CEO Recipient from Atlanta Business Chronicle,"Photo provided by Southwire

EAST SPENCER ‚Äî Each year the Southern City Tabernacle AME Zion Church honors a particular member or in this year‚Äôs case a couple with the ‚ÄúLegacy of a Leader‚Äù award.

Sunday afternoon the congregation under the leadership of Pastor Patrick Tate paid homage to life members Cynthia and Rev. Albert Johnson who have been married for more than 30 years and involved in the church not just their entire married lives but since childhood. Both have served a variety of roles within the church.

Rev. Johnson served as preacher steward for more than 15 years before going into the ministry. He is currently associate minister of the church. In addition he began employment with Pittsburg Plate & Glass (PPG) Industries of Lexington on March 13 1973. On April 1 2018 he retired as laboratory technician after 45 years of work with the company. He had 45 years of perfect attendance with the company.

In his youth Rev. Johnson attended North Rowan High School playing on the varsity football team receiving certificates of honor and an honorary team jacket. He studied Kenshi karate and Kenshi Kai karate for more than 13 years and has received numerous competition trophies and a brown belt one level below black belt.

He has attended two years of AME Zion district studies four years of Western N.C. conference studies and in June 2013 was ordained as an elder in full under the Western N.C. Conference under Bishop George E. Battle Jr.

Cynthia has served the church on junior choir the usher board and the steward board for 22 years and has been a Leader of Leaders since 2004.

Cynthia retired recently from the NC Department of Public Safety ‚Äî Piedmont Correctional Institution where she worked for more than 20 years. During her time there she made history when she was the first Black American to be promoted to administrative secretary for the institution.

On retirement she received the Order of the Long Leaf Pine and the governor‚Äôs Old North State award.

Sheafer who‚Äôs been farming outside of Wheatfield for 10 years and farmed for 20 years in Crown Point before that will soon house a different crop that relies on the sun to produce a yield: solar panels.

‚ÄúApproximately one-third of our ground is going to go into solar and I‚Äôm going to farm around it‚Äù Sheafer said on a recent morning.

The soil in Jasper County is sandy he said and every year his crops get stressed because of drought. He uses a no-till method for farming strip intercropping alternating sections of corn and soybeans to maximize the amount of sunlight each crop receives.

‚ÄúI kept the better ground to farm. The land that‚Äôs less productive is going into solar‚Äù he said adding he looks at farming as an investment. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just maximizing your return on that lesser ground.‚Äù

NextEra Energy Resources is proposing a $250 million investment in Porter County through its Malden Solar project with an estimated $52 million coming back to the county over the life of the project an estimated 35 years.

The project still in its preliminary stages has yet to receive approval from the county though NextEra is expected to ask for a tax abatement or other incentives for bringing the project here.

NextEra officials are mum on several aspects of the proposal including who the farmers are so far who have agreed to lease their property for solar array panels or the exact location of where the panels will go other than to say it includes land on either side of Smoke Road.

They did confirm that around nine farmers have signed on so far with another few possibly agreeing to lease their land. They also declined to identify who the farmers who signed prospective leases are unless the names are released during a public meeting or how much revenue they can expect to receive.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right there along Smoke Road. That‚Äôs the meridian line‚Äù said Matt Johnson developer of the project for NextEra Energy adding 80% to 90% of the land has been secured through lease agreements at about 1800 acres with the possibility of an additional 160 to 800 acres.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs safe to say we have a project in Porter County‚Äù added Zachary Melda development director for NextEra who is based in Juno Beach Florida the company headquarters.

Dunns Bridge Solar in Jasper County

NextEra on its company website touts itself as ‚Äúthe world leader in electricity generated from wind and solar‚Äù with $135 billion in total assets.

On a recent morning officials from NextEra and Northern Indiana Public Service Company which is harvesting the wattage generated by the Dunns Bridge project offered a tour of the Jasper County work in progress in Kankakee Township near Wheatfield visiting different parcels of land in varying stages of completion.

That included parcels with solar array panels fully installed and others that had only the metal racks upon which they connect all secured behind chain link fencing. NIPSCO‚Äôs R.M. Schahfer Generating Station which is being shut down was visible in the distance.

The Porter County project is expected to be similar in size and scope to the first phase of Dunns Bridge Solar which should be finished by May of next year. The second phase of that project which stretches into nearby Starke County is expected to be complete in December 2024.

‚ÄúJasper County was always in a different position than what the Malden project would be‚Äù said Stephen Eastridge executive director of the Jasper County Economic Development Organization.

The Schahfer Generating Station is being shut down in stages and is expected to be out of service around 2025 according to NIPSCO communications manager Tara McElmurry. Dunns Bridge Solar she said is just one of the utility‚Äôs projects as the company moves away from coal to renewable energy.

The generating station Eastridge said provided almost 20% of Jasper County‚Äôs tax base when he started his job there in 2017.

‚ÄúThat retirement was a really big blow to our local government bodies‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe had real concerns about our tax base and tax rate jumps.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs where Dunns Bridge Solar comes in. The Indiana legislature sets the value of agricultural property at $1250 per acre where the solar panels are going in Eastridge said. That will go up considerably with solar.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about $13000 per acre once it‚Äôs put in solar use‚Äù he said.

(Andy Lavalley for the Post-Tribune)

The Jasper County Council according to minutes from a March 19 2019 meeting approved a declining seven-year tax abatement for the first phase of Dunns Bridge Solar. The abatement approved unanimously by the county council has the county abating $1.4 million from a tax bill of a little more than $2 million.

By the seventh year Eastridge said NextEra will be paying its full tax liability.

The project according to the meeting minutes is expected to generate $35 million for landowners over 30 years. The estimated tax benefit to the county is projected at $24.5 million on a $300 million solar investment. Estimated annual revenue for the Kankakee Valley School Corporation is $660000 annually with other taxing units in the county benefiting as well.

Renewable energy in general is a hot topic Eastridge said and the project hasn‚Äôt gone without its critics.

‚ÄúThe biggest thing we come back to is ‚ÄòHow does this impact my life? What am I going to look at when I leave my driveway?'‚Äù he said adding that makes up about 90% of the concerns he hears in the community.

The project can‚Äôt be stopped on that Eastridge said adding he also hears what he calls rumors based on bad science about chemicals from the solar panels leaching into the ground. People also talk about the loss of farmland.

‚ÄúMy counter argument to that is at the end of the day if it didn‚Äôt make financial sense it wouldn‚Äôt happen‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is some of the least productive land we have in Jasper County.‚Äù

Additionally he said farmers can continue farming the rest of their acreage while reaping the financial benefits of solar income that can be spent on equipment farm outbuildings and the like and invested back into the local economy.

‚ÄúNo matter what your opinion of solar or renewables is people still want power to plug their phones in‚Äù Eastridge said.

If or when the time comes that solar energy is no longer viable he said the county‚Äôs tax base will be stable and diversified by then and the county won‚Äôt ‚Äúrun into the same kind of cliff‚Äù it did with the retirement of the generating station.

Malden Solar‚Äôs build out will take 12 to 18 months and create 250 construction jobs Johnson said adding that depending on the permitting process and timelines Malden Solar could begin operation at the end of 2024 but that could change.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still at 1% of the total farmland in Porter County‚Äù he said adding the project‚Äôs footprint of solar array panels and the fencing around them will be around 1200 acres.

The ground coverage ratio for the land under the panels will be at 35% to 40% he said adding the actual footprint will be about 750 acres ‚Äúless than half of a percent of the farmland in the county.‚Äù

Malden Solar does not yet have an agreement to provide its energy to NIPSCO which sends out requests for proposals for renewable energy projects said Andy Campbell NIPSCO‚Äôs director of portfolio planning and origination.

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs not valuable to us for some reason it could be valuable to someone else‚Äù he said.

The Malden Solar project Melda said is within a few months of going to the permit stage with Porter County depending on landowners and environmental surveys are already underway.

Detractors raise concerns

Not everyone sees a promise in solar energy.

Darren Grieger lives a few miles from the Malden Solar site in Morgan Township. He‚Äôs been farming corn beans and some livestock on the property for eight years. He took the farm over for his grandfather and his family has been farming on the same land for five or six generations.

He has ‚Äúso many‚Äù concerns about the project he said including the infusion of government funds into green energy projects which he called ‚Äúbad business.‚Äù

Additionally Grieger said solar farms reduce the amount of land available for farming which could lead to an increase in production costs. He also questioned how truly green the solar panels are from how they‚Äôre manufactured and shipped from China ‚Äî officials from NextEra Energy said most of their panels come from Vietnam though some are made in the United States ‚Äî and how they‚Äôre disposed of. NextEra officials said 95% of the materials in the panels can be recycled.

The panels Grieger said are behind fencing so ‚Äúit‚Äôs not like animals can graze‚Äù on that land. And while officials touted how the panels can be recycled Grieger said solar energy is still a relatively new field and it could be cheaper to toss them in a landfill than to recycle them.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to be just Malden. It‚Äôs going to spread if this passes‚Äù Grieger said adding he doesn‚Äôt see any benefit to the solar farms.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a really inefficient way (to generate electricity) but it‚Äôs being pushed so hard by these solar companies because there‚Äôs so much government money behind it‚Äù he said.

He expects a ‚Äúdomino effect‚Äù of farmers leasing their land for solar panels lured by the promise of additional income and other farmers jumping aboard.

‚ÄúNobody wants to live next to it‚Äù he said.

Officials don‚Äôt always welcome solar farms either.

NextEra had proposed a solar farm dubbed Brickyard Solar for Zionsville in Boone County north of Indianapolis according to published media reports. The proposal for a 1200-acre solar farm straddled city limits into unincorporated Boone County thereby requiring approval from both city and county boards.

The city‚Äôs board of zoning appeals denied a special exception request for the solar array. The county‚Äôs advisory planning commission also rejected the proposal stating that it deviated from the county‚Äôs comprehensive plan which said the area was supposed to stay in traditional agricultural production. NextEra subsequently withdrew its proposal about a year ago.

Robert Thompson Porter County‚Äôs director of development and stormwater management said in an email that the county‚Äôs comprehensive plan ‚Äúdoes not discuss clean or green energy solutions‚Äù and added that the plan was approved in 2002 but does not discuss that type of land use.

The county now has two small solar farms at around 10 acres each that produce about 1 megawatt each Thompson said. One of them is west of the Sedley Road bridge just south of Indiana 130 and the other is on Robbins Road adjacent to Portage city limits.

County officials expect that as is the case in Jasper County NextEra will request a financial incentive for any project here.

‚ÄúMost Indiana counties have negotiated economic development agreements with the solar farm developers‚Äù Stu Summers a consultant working with Porter County as part of the team of county staff negotiating economic development agreements for solar farms said in an email.

‚ÄúTypically the agreements require a bond to assure that at the end of the solar panels‚Äô useful life the property will be returned to its original state allowing for renewed agricultural activities. Also counties have granted limited tax abatement in return for economic development payments from the solar farm operations.‚Äù

So far they have not reached an agreement Summers said but if they do it will require the approval of the Board of Commissioners and the County Council.

Nothing has been formally presented to the council for a tax abatement hearing Thompson said in an email. ‚ÄúThere have been some very preliminary discussions on an economic package but nothing has been agreed upon as of yet or drafted up in an agreement format.‚Äù

‚ÄòA little bit of a gamble‚Äô

Sheafer the Jasper County farmer said he was approached around 2015 by Orion Renewables which came to the area to secure lease options for a solar project with the goal of putting the project together and selling it. The project was sold to NextEra Energy which is now developing it.

Sheafer who turns 60 next month has two adult children and neither is interested in farming. If they were he would have been less inclined to go into solar.

‚ÄúThe beauty of it is as we get older I don‚Äôt have to worry about weather because a percentage of our land won‚Äôt be cropped anymore‚Äù he said adding the returns on solar are roughly three times on average what he could make from farming the property.

While his property taxes will go up because of the added value of the land NextEra Energy will pay for any additional assessment beyond what Sheafer is paying now and will do so for the life of the lease agreement.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs really no additional cost for us at all and I don‚Äôt have to put the crops out which is a lot of money‚Äù he said.

He understands folks who oppose taking their land out of farm production and homeowners against solar because of how it changes the view from their property.

‚ÄúI get it. This is pretty to look at‚Äù he said sitting at his dining room table with his wife Anne and gazing out at his yard dotted with bird feeders and abutting alternating rows of corn and soybeans.

Both his traditional crops and his new one of solar panels capture the energy of the sun Sheafer said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little bit of a gamble‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI hope we look back in 30 years and say ‚ÄòYeah we‚Äôre glad we did this.'‚Äù

No we're not suggesting forgoing that family trip to see the Grand Canyon in person. However you can often catch a glimpse of some of America's best views without even landing in that city or state. All you need is a seat on an airplane ‚Äî a window seat that is.

Additionally apps such as Flyover Country use scientific maps to tell you all about the points of interest that you're passing over. All you have to do is plug in your flight path before you depart; the app works offline so you won't be reliant on data or often-spotty inflight Wi-Fi.

There are of course a few major caveats for getting the full experience: You'll get the best views of most of these sites when flying during the day although places like Las Vegas can be quite amazing at night. Another hard-to-control factor: the weather. It can be the difference between a beautiful view of the Earth and one of clouds alone.

With luck on your side here are the seven most scenic plane routes to remind you that they don't call it ""America the Beautiful"" for nothing.

Over the Grand Canyon

As we mentioned there's nothing like a real visit. However it never hurts to steal a glimpse of the Grand Canyon when you can.

There are many routes that take you over this natural wonder. These include transcontinental flights to Los Angeles flights into Las Vegas (sit on the right side) and short-hop flights from Phoenix to Salt Lake City (your best bet is the left side). Not only can you see one of America's greatest landmarks but the Southwest is an incredibly beautiful region in and of itself.

New York City: Landing or taking off at LaGuardia

Walking the streets of New York it's easy to forget just how big the city is. The best way to get a sense of the sprawl is from the air.

Most flights in and out of LaGuardia Airport (LGA) guarantee you some version of a view of the Manhattan skyline depending on the flight path. The left side will yield spectacular views most times but sitting on the right may be good too.

Winds and the runway in use will change so it's hard to predict where to sit but one thing is for sure: Keep your camera or phone ready day or night as New York will often dazzle you even before you set foot on the ground.

Niagara Falls: Albany New York to Chicago

While certainly not one of America's most-traveled routes flights from Albany International Airport (ALB) to Chicago can be a great means to an end: getting a bird's-eye view of Niagara Falls.

Book the left side of the plane for your best shot at a view of the majesty of the falls minus all the tourists. On a clear day the view can rival that of those below you who shelled out money for a pricey helicopter ride. This works with flights into either O'Hare International Airport (ORD) or Midway International Airport (MDW).

Golden Gate Bridge: Landing in San Francisco

San Francisco: So much to do so little time. In case you miss the chance to check out the Golden Gate Bridge in person you can catch it on the way into town.

On many flights arriving from Asia or Europe or from points north of the city a seat on the left side is a good bet for a great view of the bridge and city. Even if you only catch a quick glimpse of it like senior aviation reporter Ethan Klapper did on the final United Boeing 747 flight in 2017 it's a sight that's memorable nonetheless!

Yosemite National Park: Sacramento to Las Vegas

If you're flying from Sacramento International Airport (SMF) to Las Vegas' Harry Reid International Airport (LAS) a flyover of California's Yosemite National Park will send you off in style. Sit on the right side of the plane and keep your eyes peeled for the notable Half Dome.

Can't make the flight during the day? You'll always have the twinkling view of Vegas at night as a silver lining.

Landing in Washington DC

The left side of the plane is a good bet when landing at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). If you're lucky your pilots will fly the so-called river visual. This winding approach over the Potomac ends in a southbound landing at Reagan. Passengers will get a view of the Washington Monument and Thomas Jefferson Memorial among other famous sights.

(Photo by Robert Alexander/Getty Images)

If you're sitting on the right side taking off in the opposite direction you can also catch a pretty good view of the National Mall area. TPG's Sean Cudahy got this view of the Washington Monument with the Capitol off in the distance when taking off from Reagan one night in October 2019.

The volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest: Taking off or landing in Seattle

The amount of volcanic beauty packed into the Pacific Northwest is unparalleled elsewhere in the U.S. When taking off or landing at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) you've got Mount Rainier Mount Hood Mount Adams Mount St. Helens and Mount Baker so close it feels like you could touch them. It reminds you of your place on Earth.

Snag a seat on the right side of the aircraft on takeoff hope that the winds are right and departures are to the north and prepare to be in awe. On landing in Seattle the left side is often the better choice to catch the best views.

Bottom line

Most of the time when we select a seat for a flight we factor in things like legroom proximity to the front of the plane and the restrooms.

There's another factor to consider next time you make a seat selection though: whether to sit on the left side or right in hopes of enjoying the best inflight sightseeing.

A bit of research before your next flight could go a long way toward getting you the best photos before you even land. Just be sure to book a window seat.

Passenger flight ET343 a Boeing 737-800 was traveling from Khartoum to Addis Ababa when the pilots nodded off and flew past the runway continuing their route Aviation Herald reports.

Air traffic control tried to contact the pilots multiple times but could not get ahold of them the aviation news site reported. When the pilots flew past the landing point autopilot disengaged setting an alarm that woke them up.

Once awake the pilots rerouted the plane back to Addis Ababa Bole International Airport where they safely landed 25 minutes later which can be seen in a flight map from FlightAware.

Ethiopian Airlines would not confirm whether the pilots fell asleep but it did put out a statement Friday stating that the flight ""temporarily"" lost communication with air traffic control.

""The concerned crew have been removed from operation pending further investigation"" Ethiopian Airlines said. ""Appropriate corrective action will be taken based on the outcome of the investigation. Safety has always been and will continue to be our first priority.""

It's unclear how many passengers were aboard.

Pilot fatigue is not new. In fact in-flight fatigue has been reported by 68 to 91% of commercial airline pilots according to a study last year conducted by Frontiers.

Earlier this year the Southwest Airlines Pilot Association the union which represents Southwest Airlines pilots told airlines executives in an open letter that exhaustion amongst crews has become dangerous.

""Fatigue both acute and cumulative has become Southwest Airlines' number-one safety threat"" the letter stated.

The letter also described the consequences of flying while fatigued.

""The many negative impacts of fatigue are well-documented ‚Äî impaired judgment lack of concentration reduced in-flight attention and heightened emotional activity leading to poor cognitive processing along with decreased reaction time and slower hand-eye coordination to name a few"" the SWAPA wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYWVyb3hwbG9yZXIuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2pzeC1leWVzLW5ldy1zZXJ2aWNlLWJldHdlZW4tZGFsbGFzLWFuZC1vcmFuZ2UtY291bnR5LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JSX Eyes New Service Between Dallas and Orange County,"Next month United States-based carrier JSX will launch a route between Dallas Texas and Orange County California to add to its network. Currently JSX serves both destinations from other US cities; the pair will now receive a daily route using private terminals at each airport. JSX will begin service on September 29 from its Dallas Love Field (DAL) base to John Wayne Airport (SNA) in Orange County California.

The hub carrier at Dallas Love Southwest Airlines operates the route with its larger narrowbody: the Boeing 737. Nonetheless JSX presents an unconventional model to travelers in comparison to other U.S. airlines. One of the carrier's most prominent selling points is that passengers arrive and depart from private terminal facilities allowing for a more secluded and efficient experience. JSX touts its private lounge in the terminal and a quick security screening to allow for passengers to complete the check-in and security process in 20 minutes.

Additionally this service which will be operated by Embraer ERJ aircraft features a 1-1 seating configuration with over 36 inches of pitch and 19 inches of width. At first glance JSX flights seem more fitted for business travelers with a two-bag checked luggage allowance onboard cocktail service spacious legroom and free wifi. However the carrier appeals to leisure travelers by accommodating skis golf bags and snowboards as checked luggage.

JSX's service between Dallas and Orange County will take three hours and thirty minutes. Photo: JSX

Out of Dallas Love Field JSX delivers its unique experience via intra-Texas routes to business hubs like Houston and Austin routes to the Western U.S. like Denver and Las Vegas and routes to Florida like Destin and Miami. Meanwhile Orange County concentrates primarily on several intra-Western U.S. hops to Nevada Colorado and within California. This newest route out of Orange County represents a paradigm shift as JSX ventures to longer flying for the Los Angeles area.

Fares for this new route between Dallas Love Field and Orange Country start at a hefty $499 per passenger price point. In contrast at the time of writing Southwest charges $195 for a non-stop flight between Dallas and Orange County.

The incident which took place on Aug. 1 was manager Melissa Morris‚Äôs first day working at the Anderson Starbucks store.

She was walking into a volatile situation. Like many Starbucks workers across the country baristas at the store had become increasingly dissatisfied.

‚ÄúWe were tired of how management was treating us not listening to our complaints‚Äù says Aneil Tripathi 19 who took his first ever job in the Anderson store and led the unionization effort. ‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt stepped a foot on the floor they probably never made a drink in their life. And they‚Äôre telling us how to do our jobs.‚Äù

Tripathi recalled how on one particularly busy Sunday he found the store understaffed‚Äîthree people were doing the job of six. He called the district manager for help. It was her day off and he could hear the TV on in the background. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much I can do‚Äù she told him. That day he sent an email to Starbucks Workers United‚Äîan independent labor union that has been organizing workers nationwide‚Äîasking for advice on how to unionize the store.

The unionization campaign at the Anderson store was a wild success. The May 31 vote was unanimous with all 18 workers voting to join. ‚ÄúIt was kind of a big deal‚Äù Tripathi says because northern South Carolina is very pro-Trump and historically anti-union.

In response to the vote workers say management cracked down on the Anderson store. They were told they couldn‚Äôt wear pro-union T-shirts and management started unilaterally cutting their hours as well as shortening the store‚Äôs opening times.

Starbucks has been scrambling to respond to a wave of stores unionizing nationwide. In an effort to stem the flow the company announced on May 3 that it would roll out a new packet of benefits on Aug. 1 but there was a catch. Workers at unionized stores would not be eligible for the new perks. Instead each would have to negotiate their own contract individually.

The Anderson baristas had gone out on strike twice last month but this edict was the final straw.

‚ÄúOur store was very frustrated‚Äù said Tripathi. The baristas reacted angrily to news they would be excluded from the very benefits they had been demanding and felt like it was retaliation for organizing.

So they began to plan a ‚ÄúMarch on the Boss‚Äù a federally protected direct action in which workers present their demands directly to their manager. They drafted a letter asking for new equipment for the store and demanding that they receive the same pay raise being given to non-unionized stores.

They planned to take action on Aug. 1‚Äîthe day the new benefits were rolled out.

Originally the Anderson workers had planned to confront their store manager but she quit after the first strike. Their new manager Melissa Morris started Aug. 1.

‚ÄúUnfortunately for her that was the day it fell on‚Äù says Tripathi.

The workers gathered around Morris and read their letter aloud.

‚ÄúWe are not going to move until some action is taken for our raise. No work is being done on the floor and no customers are being served‚Äù one worker told Morris in audio published by More Perfect Union on Twitter.

‚ÄúWe carried this company on our shoulders through the pandemic at the risk of our health and loved ones‚Äô health‚Äù another worker tells Morris in the recording ‚Äúand we have nothing to show for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt menacing‚Äù says Tripathi ‚ÄúWe were a good distance away from her.‚Äù

Video of the incident released by Starbucks Workers United shows Morris sitting at a table in the store surrounded by 10 workers while another employee films the situation. While speaking to the district manager on the phone Morris stands up brushes past one of the workers and stops before reaching the door. Workers followed her to the door but did not block her path Tripathi says.

‚ÄúNo one was blocking the door‚Äù he told The Daily Beast. ‚ÄúThe door was unlocked.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill you let me exit the building?‚Äù Morris asks the workers still on the phone.

‚ÄúYes‚Äù Tripathi answered.

The entire interaction lasted around six minutes according to audio of the incident.

Two days later Morris filed a report with the Anderson County Sheriff‚Äôs Office alleging that her employees had kidnapped her at the store and ‚Äúwould not let her leave until they got a raise.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne employee also assaulted her‚Äù Morris told police and the incident was ‚Äúcaptured on video‚Äù according to a police report viewed by The Daily Beast.

Morris was not immediately available for comment.

Police came to the store and interviewed workers about the kidnapping allegation.

‚ÄúThey saw that we‚Äôre not criminals we‚Äôre people who make coffee‚Äù Tripathi says.

On Aug. 6 Tripathi and 10 other workers at the store found out they were being suspended.

The store manager ‚Äúfelt threatened and unsafe as a result of conduct by 11 store partners‚Äù Starbucks said in a statement adding that they had been advised by law enforcement to suspend workers ‚Äúuntil their investigation is complete.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey want to make an example out of us‚Äù says Tripathi who sees the suspension as direct retaliation for organizing.

The Anderson County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said a detective is still investigating the case and it has not been determined yet if charges will be filed.

‚ÄúBossnapping‚Äù or taking your boss hostage during a labor dispute is an unusual tactic but occurs occasionally in France where workers have been known to kidnap their employers for several days. The strategy is unknown in the United States.

‚ÄúI cannot believe I have to say this but workers who are organizing for better working conditions should not have to deal with their boss accusing them of kidnapping and assault‚Äù Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted on Aug. 8 ‚ÄúHow outrageous. This campaign of rampant union-busting from Starbucks has got to end.‚Äù

The kidnapping charge is just the latest example of Starbucks‚Äôs aggressive response to union organizing by its workers since the campaign began in Buffalo New York in 2021. To date 223 Starbucks stores have voted to unionize.

Tripathi believes Morris filed the police report on the advice of Starbucks management who are being counseled by Littler Mendelson‚Äîthe high-powered law firm Starbucks has brought in to help them.

The firm which has also represented Apple and Trader Joes is notorious for its aggressive union-busting tactics.

To date Starbucks has fired over 85 pro-union workers at stores across the country according to Starbucks Workers United who also say the company is engaged in underhand illegal anti-union tactics including spreading disinformation closing stores intimidating workers retaliating against those who organize and attempting to halt elections.

On Thursday the National Labor Relations Board the federal body that adjudicates disputes between unions and management found that Starbucks had violated the law when they fired seven union-involved baristas in Memphis Tennessee. A judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate the workers and to ‚Äúcease and desist from unlawful activities.‚Äù Starbucks said it disagrees with the verdict and plans to appeal according to a statement posted to their website.

The union has filed 291 unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against Starbucks since their organizing campaign began. The Board has already found merit in 87 of these allegations accusing Starbucks of illegally interfering with and coercing workers and taking retaliatory action against organizers.

But it may take months or even years for the Board to wade through all the complaints and their enforcement power is limited.

‚ÄúIt really is kind of an amazing anti-union crime wave from this company that professes to be a progressive employer and to care about its people‚Äù says John Logan a professor and director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State. Logan believes the harsh tactics Starbucks is employing are part of Littler Mendelson‚Äôs anti-union playbook.

‚ÄúHiring Littler Mendelson is like planting a flag and saying: we‚Äôre going to fight this union to the death‚Äù Logan says ‚ÄúIt has unlimited resources with which to fight this campaign.‚Äù

Littler Mendelson founded in 1942 has grown into an enormous international firm employing thousands of lawyers across the world. The firm specializes in union-avoidance. It made more than $658 million in gross annual revenue in 2021 according to its website. In June the firm handed out average bonuses of $10000 to high-performing employees according to the legal blog Above The Law.

At least 50 Littler Mendelson lawyers spread across 17 states have been working for Starbucks in just the last three months according to a Daily Beast review of NLRB filings since June 2022. At least three of these lawyers are also representing Trader Joes which is engaged in its own battle against unionization efforts at its stores.

‚ÄúIt might be the most expensive anti-union campaign of all time‚Äù Logan says.

On Friday Starbucks workers at stores on North Broadway in Chicago and in Clifton Park New York voted overwhelmingly in favor of unionizing while a vote at a separate location in Louisville Kentucky was much closer with 10 people voting yes 7 voting no and 3 ballots being challenged.

Starbucks CEO billionaire Howard Schultz has taken an active role in anti-union efforts blaming outside agitators for stoking resentment among employees. Last month he told a New York Times event that he could not accept a future for the company with a union involved ‚Äúbecause we have a different view.‚Äù

In Schultz‚Äôs 1999 memoir Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time Schultz recalls watching unionization efforts at Starbucks in the late 1980s.

‚ÄúThere is no more precious commodity than the relationship of trust and confidence a company has with its employees‚Äù he wrote ‚ÄúOnce they start distrusting management the company‚Äôs future is compromised.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy52Y3N0YXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY29tbXVuaXRpZXMvY29uZWpvLXZhbGxleS8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL3dvcmstc3RhcnRzLXRob3VzYW5kLW9ha3MtbmV3LXN0YXJidWNrcy1uZWFyLXNpbmdsZS1mYW1pbHktaG9tZXMvMTAzMzEwNDUwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Work begins in Thousand Oaks on new Starbucks drive-thru near single-family homes,"Work has begun on a new Starbucks drive-thru on the same Thousand Oaks site where the developer's previous plans to build a 7-Eleven and gas station were denied by the city amid community opposition.

Grading of the empty lot at 2198 N. Moorpark Road has been completed the city's planning manager Steve Kearns said Friday.

The next step is for the developer Megdal & Associates to obtain a work permit from the city to begin construction at the site which is near single-family homes and diagonally across the street from Thousand Oaks High School.

Before the permit can be issued however the developer must demonstrate that it has incorporated several changes into its plans that were required by the city Planning Commission when it approved the project in January 2021 he said.

Among the requirements is that a sound and privacy wall be increased from 6 feet to 8 feet high to address nearby residents' concerns about noise from the coffee drive-thru.

Thumbs down: Thousand Oaks Planning Commission denies 7-Eleven across from high school

Kearns said he didn't want to speculate on when the work permit will be issued.

""It's as quick as their architect can modify their plans resubmit them to us and then we can do a plan check and issue the permit"" he said. ""After that they can roll out their construction crews.""

It's been a long haul for Megdal & Associates to finally start developing the site.

Planning commissioners in July 2019 unanimously denied the developer's proposal to build the 7-Eleven convenience store and gas station there.

Prior to the commission's vote about 20 residents spoke out against the project arguing that it wasn't a good fit for their neighborhoods.

""Our community is a nice calm residential community with a great high school in the middle"" one of the speakers Robin Kaswick told the commission.

The project is ""not improving our community"" she said. ""It's a detriment to our community.""

Megdal & Associates appealed the commission's denial to the City Council but lost.

Thumbs up: Thousand Oaks green-lights 264-unit apartment project

The developer in 2020 submitted a new application to the city for the Starbucks. It came before the Planning Commission in January 2021.

The project ""integrates well with the surrounding neighborhood and has been designed to minimize impacts to existing single-family residential uses"" a staff report said.

Even so a number of residents spoke against it but not as many as at the 2019 hearing.

""I see this as a traffic and safety nightmare"" Amy Wilson told the commission. ""It is definitely going to change the scope of my neighborhood.""

Developer Taylor Megdal said that after the 7-Eleven project was denied his team did community outreach in which many residents were asking ""'Why don't you bring us a Starbucks?'

""So ironically we were able to get a Starbucks"" he said yet some residents are still opposed.

""You can't please everyone"" he added. ""But I can't tell you how proud I am of this proposal.""

The commission unanimously greenlighted the new project.

""I do like the fact that there were a lot less complaints this time from the community"" said Don Lanson a commissioner who served as chair at the time. ""I think a lot of people as much as they have concerns look at this as the best we can possibly do at this location.""

Megdal couldn't be reached for comment Friday.

""Starbucks has a problem"" Rachel Demarest Gold an employer-side attorney at Abrams Fensterman LLP told Yahoo Finance in a phone interview. ""By the time a workforce gets to the point where it's in an election for union representation the company already has a problem and probably has had a problem for a long time with its employees because satisfied workers don't turn to unions.""

The union drive at Starbucks stores nationwide began in December 2021 at a store in Buffalo New York and more than 310 stores in 36 states have filed for election petitions. Starbucks Workers United a subsidiary of the Workers United labor union is leading organization efforts.

According to records from the NLRB an independent federal labor agency with leaders appointed by President Biden more than 220 stores have voted in favor of unionization so far.

Starbucks has strongly opposed unionization with CEO Howard Schultz denouncing the ""threat of unionization"" and rolling out pay increases for store employees that exclude those at unionized stores.

NLRB regional offices have issued nearly 20 unfair labor practice complaints against Starbucks. The agency has also asked a court to halt the company's alleged union-busting campaign.

The coffee giant is now accusing the NLRB of impropriety: On Monday Starbucks sent a 16-page letter to NLRB officials accusing the agency of managing union elections in a way that unfairly helped workers unionize.

""It's tit for tat"" Gold said. ""It's an adversarial process. So if I find that you have done something wrong and it helps my case I'm gonna bring it up.""

Starbucks's letter to the NLRB

In the letter Starbucks alleged that the agency's regional staff repeatedly crossed the line of neutrality during an election in the Kansas City area by secretly coordinating ""in-person"" voting at the NLRB offices during a ""mail-ballot"" election giving union representatives confidential election information disenfranchising voters that did not cast in-person votes and mishandling ballots.

‚ÄúThe purpose of this misconduct was to tip-the-scale in order to deliver the outcome sought by the Union"" Starbucks general counsel stated in the letter. ""The result of the misconduct was to ignore ‚Äî and bypass ‚Äî the actual sentiments that Starbucks partners may have expressed in properly conducted elections.‚Äù

NLRB press secretary Kayla Blado told Yahoo Finance in a statement that while the NLRB ""does not comment on open cases"" the agency has ""well-established processes to raise challenges regarding the handling of both election matters and unfair labor practice cases.""

Starbucks Workers United called the letter ""absurd"" and the allegations an attempt ""to distract attention away from their unprecedented anti-union campaign.""

The letter from Starbucks counsel requested that the NLRB immediately suspend all Starbucks mail-ballot elections nationwide and asked the board to stay a judgment that ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven workers in Memphis Tennessee who were fired earlier this year during an attempt to unionize a store.

The Starbucks letter is not without precedent: After an historic union election victory at a Staten Island warehouse Amazon (AMZN) by accused the NLRB of inappropriately leading the union to victory by coercing and misleading voters.

According to Matthew Bodie a former lawyer for the labor board who teaches law at St. Louis University Starbucks's public letter against the NLRB stands out for the intensity of its rhetoric.

U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders speaks during a unionization rally held by Starbucks Workers United in Richmond Virginia U.S. April 24 2022. REUTERS/Julia Rendleman (Julia Rendleman / reuters)

The company is ""politicizing this by calling for a nationwide moratorium on these elections"" Bodie told Yahoo Finance in a phone interview. ""I think what they're angling for is to get some Republican lawmakers on board with questioning the integrity of the NLRB.""

Bodie added that the ideal scenario for Starbucks ""would be if the Republicans would take it either the House and or the Senate then there'll be hearings about NLRB election integrity and the Republicans will try and make the NLRB seem like a biased organization that can't be trusted.""

Hearings based on the accusations are ongoing with both sides presenting evidence. At some point Bodie explained the Hearing Officer ""will make her recommendation to the Regional Director of Region 29-Brooklyn who is handling the case on whether there should be a new election. The Regional Director will then make a decision on whether there will be a new election or if the results of the election will be certified.""

Not every drink can be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea (no pun intended) and that seems to be the case with the new Cold Brew with Lemonade according to employees on the internet.

In fact one TikTok creator was so shocked by the taste of the featured drink it made her gag. Yikes! Barista @kayli.cernan posted a video of herself trying the concoction for the first time. ‚ÄúNew featured drink‚Ä¶. immediately no‚Äù she wrote in the caption.

The video which amassed more than 141.3K views shows Kay begrudgingly making the unique drink before taking a sip and gagging with disgust. Okay so we can assume this shouldn‚Äôt be at the top of our must-try list next time we pull up to Starbucks‚Ä¶

And it seems that many others have the same opinion including fellow baristas. ‚ÄúI was already horrified when I first saw the weekly update‚Äù one user wrote with another saying the ‚Äúlong lasting aftertaste is hell.‚Äù Another commenter even called this drink ‚Äútraumatizing to try.‚Äù Yikes! That bad?!

Apparently it is that bad. Back in February when the Cold Brew with Lemonade was a ‚Äúbarista pick‚Äù (drinks only Starbucks Rewards Visa Card members can buy) baristas took to Reddit to express their distaste for the beverage going as far to call it a ‚Äúsick joke.‚Äù The infamy!

Consumers across Twitter are also debating the quality of the drink. ""Lemonade and cold brew??? Capitalism did not pop off"" one user joked. ""Starbucks is foul for even promoting the Cold Brew and Lemonade"" another wrote.

However some are rushing to the defense of the unpopular beverage. ""Apparently the new 'add lemonade' option when ordering cold brew on the Starbucks app has generated some confusion and controversy. It's not for everyone but I like it"" another said. To each their own!

We have to be honest‚Äîeven though everyone is saying it tastes terrible all of the controversy is kind of making us want to give it a try for ourselves. Is this marketing at its finest?! More importantly will you try it? Or have you already? Let us know in the comments!"

In fact they classify 105 cities in Missouri as Tree Cities.

What You Need To Know Arbor Day Foundation recognizes over 100 communities in Missouri as ""Tree City USA""



Any size community is eligible for designation



Ellisville Mo. has been recognized for 41 years as a ""Tree City""



Program extends past communities to colleges utilities and even health care campuses

The nationally recognized program sponsored by the Arbor Day Foundation and administered locally by the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) aims to provide a framework to assist communities in establishing a healthy and sustainable urban forestry program.

Standards of the program

The program founded in 1976 aimed to educate citizens about the importance of trees to the environment and their own community by specifically developing urban forestry programs and proactively planting and caring for trees. Cities of any population from less than 100 to over 1 million can qualify.

To earn status as a Tree City a community needs to meet ‚Äúfour overarching standards.‚Äù Those include:

1. Maintaining a tree board or department

2. Having a community tree ordinance

3. Spending at least $2 per capita on urban forestry

4. Celebrating Arbor Day

Missouri by the numbers

As of 2022 the Arbor Day Foundation has recognized 105 communities in Missouri as Tree City USA communities equating to 45% of the state. Glen Echo Mo. population 150 is the smallest municipality in the state with this recognition. As for the largest that spot goes to Kansas City Mo. with a population of 441545.

The longest-running active tree city community is Mexico with 43 years and counting. St. Peters holds the spot for the longest active growth with 22 years.

Other notable communities in the St. Louis region that have received recognition include Ellisville with 41 years Des Peres with 39 years Brentwood with 34 years and Florissant with 32 years. St. Ann and Ladue are relative newcomers with three years of recognition each.

See if your community made the list.

The state has spent nearly $24 million on urban forestry management averaging $8.54 per capita. The reported number of trees planted stands at just over 14000.

Research has shown trees yield three to five times their cost in overall benefits to the communities that manage them. Trees can lower costs for storm water management by absorbing excess water and even help to reduce energy consumption.

Trees provide a positive impact for people as well by improving their overall health and property values.

Other programs

This initiative extends not just to communities but to several other entities as well including college campuses. St. Charles Community College University of Missouri St. Louis and Washington University in St. Louis all meet the criteria as Tree Campuses in our region.

Other programs along the same lines include Tree Line USA Utilities and Tree Campus Healthcare. All aimed at promoting the same cause trees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy83Ni1vd25lcnNoaXAtZ2Vud29ydGgtZmluYW5jaWFsLWluYy0xMjUyMzg0MDkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With 76% ownership Genworth Financial Inc. (NYSE:GNW) boasts of strong institutional backing,"To get a sense of who is truly in control of Genworth Financial Inc. (NYSE:GNW) it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company around 76% to be precise is institutions. In other words the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.

Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Genworth Financial beginning with the chart below.

See our latest analysis for Genworth Financial

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Genworth Financial?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

Genworth Financial already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Genworth Financial (below). Of course keep in mind that there are other factors to consider too.

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Genworth Financial is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock Inc. with ownership of 15%. The Vanguard Group Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 11% of common stock and State Street Global Advisors Inc. holds about 4.2% of the company stock. Furthermore CEO Thomas McInerney is the owner of 0.8% of the company's shares.

After doing some more digging we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. While there is some analyst coverage the company is probably not widely covered. So it could gain more attention down the track.

The cable industry is impacted by the nationwide cord-cutting trend though as some customers are ditching traditional pay-TV entirely. Comcast has so far been able to withstand this trend through growth from its other businesses.

In late July V.F. Corp reported (7/28/22) financial results for the fiscal 2023 first quarter. Revenue of $2.26 billion rose 3.2% year over year and beat analyst estimates by $20 million. The North Face brand led the way with 37% currency-neutral revenue growth in the quarter.

However inflation took its toll on margins and profits. Gross margin of 53.9% for the quarter declined 260 basis points while operating margin of 2.8% declined 640 basis points. As a result adjusted EPS declined 68% to $0.09 per share.

Adjusted earnings-per-share grew 67% from $0.27 to $0.45 but missed analysts‚Äô consensus by $0.02. For the new fiscal year V.F. Corp expects revenue growth of at least 7% and adjusted earnings-per-share of $3.30 to $3.40.

We expect 7% annual EPS growth over the next five years. VFC stock also has a dividend yield of 4.5%. Annual returns from an expanding P/E multiple are estimated at ~6.2% equaling total expected annual returns of 17.7% through 2027.

Blue-Chip Stock #2: Sonoco Products (SON)

Dividend History: 40 years of consecutive increases

40 years of consecutive increases Dividend Yield: 3.2%

3.2% Expected Total Return: 17.8%

Sonoco Products provides packaging industrial products and supply chain services to its customers. The markets that use the company‚Äôs products include those in the appliances electronics beverage construction and food industries. Sonoco was founded in Hartsville South Carolina in 1899 and introduced the first paper textile cone. The company generates about $7.2 billion in annual sales. Sonoco Products is now composed of 2 segments Consumer Packaging and Industrial Packaging with all other businesses listed as ‚Äúall other‚Äù.

On July 21st 2022 Sonoco Products reported second quarter earnings results for the period ending July 3rd 2022. Revenue surged 38.4% to a company record $1.91 billion which was in-line with analysts‚Äô expectations. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $1.76 compared very favorably to $0.84 in the prior year and was $0.11 above estimates.

Source: Investor Presentation

Consumer Packaging revenues grew 65.6% to a segment record $990.1 million due once again in large part to the purchase of Ball Metalpack that closed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Higher selling prices also factored into results. Global rigid paper containers had slight volume growth outside of North America where supply constraints limited business.

Flexible packaging volume grew 4% but was offset by mix. Industrial Paper Packing sales grew 20% to a segment record $727.4 million as higher selling prices more than offset a small volume decline and currency exchange headwinds.

Sonoco Products raised its outlook for 2022 as well with the company expecting adjusted earnings-per-share of $6.20 to $6.30 for the year up from $5.25 to $5.45 and $4.60 to $4.80 previously.

During the past five years the company‚Äôs dividend payout ratio has averaged around 33%. With the current payout ratio of 27% THG‚Äôs dividend payments are well covered by earnings. Given the expected earnings growth there is still room for the dividend to continue to grow moving forward while maintaining a payout ratio below 30%.

The Hanover Insurance Group is a diversified and solid insurer with a differentiated P&C franchise in a fragmented market. With their differentiating strategy such as specialized products and distinctive agency partnerships the company can strengthen its competitive advantages. Furthermore Hanover Insurance has a S&P and AM Best ‚ÄúA‚Äù-rating and a stable outlook.

We expect 11% EPS growth over the next five years. In addition the stock has a 2.3% dividend yield while we expect 5.1% returns from an expanding P/E multiple.

In years prior buying a $200 phone meant sacrificing almost every single aspect of performance. Does the REVVL 6 Pro 5G from T-Mobile fit that same model? We had a chance to spend some time with the carrier‚Äôs newest $219 budget device.

When looking for a new device it‚Äôs important to eye up the competition. Google‚Äôs latest budget offering ‚Äì the Pixel 6a ‚Äì is an outstanding deal yet it will still end up costing you $449 at full price. Samsung also ends up in the ring with its Galaxy A-series devices which drive a hard bargain. Those can end up being a steal too at various low costs.

T-Mobile is looking to give us an enticing deal with the REVVL 6 Pro 5G a budget device that has some tempting specs listed on paper.

Hardware and display

As with any phone the very first thing you notice is the build quality. After all it‚Äôs arguably one of the most important parts of a genuinely good device.

The REVVL 6 Pro 5G has a surprisingly good build even though it‚Äôs made of plastic. The back holds a nice matte grey color and bears a frosted look and feel to it. The edges are plastic as well though it doesn‚Äôt give off that look so obviously. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning this device has a heft to it; not too much but enough to make you feel better about the materials.

The bottom of the device houses a USB-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack ‚Äì something you don‚Äôt see all too often. A nice touch you might notice at first glance is the colored power button made to match T-Mobile magenta. It isn‚Äôt all for looks though. That power button is one of the features that make the REVVL 6 Pro stand out among its budget friends ‚Äì it‚Äôs also a fingerprint sensor. As far as accuracy goes the sensor gets it right about 7 out of 10 times.

Most devices in this price range rely solely on a PIN or passcode for device security. Since the REVVL 6 Pro has a fingerprint sensor you can easily unlock it with a comfortable tap of your thumb. Surprisingly the sensor is pretty fast. Touching it unlocked my device in less than a second which is perfectly acceptable.

In the front lies the absolutely massive display. The HD+ display comes in at 6.82-inches making for a huge viewing area. Unfortunately this is where you start to realize that corners were absolutely cut to get to the $219 price point this device comes in at.

The total resolution for the HD+ display is 1640 x 720. Comparatively the Pixel 6a comes in at 2400 x 1080 though it covers a smaller area. The REVVL 6 Pro by no means has a bad display rather it‚Äôs perfectly adequate for everyday tasks ‚Äìhat I really struggled with was watching videos through YouTube and other streaming platforms.

Since the resolution isn‚Äôt very high the details are hard to make out and I found myself being pulled away from whatever I was watching. Paired with that the screen doesn‚Äôt get very bright automatically during everyday use and when manually adjusted you might be disappointed at max brightness as well. It can sometimes be a little hard to read the display at max brightness when outdoors or even when its bright inside.

Software and performance

The REVVL 6 Pro runs Android 12 something you‚Äôll see in just about any phone sold now ‚Äì other than Google Pixel phones. Out of the box the REVVL 6 Pro is equipped with July‚Äôs security patch and comes with tons of Google‚Äôs apps and software giving off a pretty stock experience mostly.

Since the device comes from T-Mobile you can expect it to be peppered with bloatware here and there. The REVVL 6 Pro will greet you with a T-Mobile splash screen when you first turn it on and unless you complete T-Mobile‚Äôs separate device setup you‚Äôll see a static notification asking you to do so.

Additionally scrolling to the left from the home screen will take you to Google Discover a stock feature on most Android 12 devices. Accompanying it is T-Mobile‚Äôs version that showcases the same material though much less personalized.

Other than that T-Mobile‚Äôs skin isn‚Äôt a far reach from stock Android 12 and most of the experience is left unchanged. That experience is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 700 SoC which is a 7nm chip that runs a 5G modem for fast connectivity. After all this is the REVVL 6 Pro 5G. That paired with 6GB RAM and 128GB expandable storage makes for an alright experience; everyday use could be a little faster though it‚Äôs completely usable and gets the job done.

The REVVL 6 Pro 5G runs a 60Hz display which is what you might expect for a device at this price point. Unfortunately it can often feel like less with the jelly scrolling issue you might come across on this device. This is more than likely a product of the lighter chipset used though it‚Äôs something you can ignore over a small time period.

Over a longer period of time you can likely expect T-Mobile to keep up with software updates as they did with the REVVL 4+ back in 2021. T-Mobile doesn‚Äôt have a concrete update timeline or promises set for any specific Android though the popularity of the budget device will likely influence how regularly its kept up to date.

Battery

If the REVVL 6 Pro 5G excels at one thing it‚Äôs battery life. Once fully charged the REVVL 6 Pro will idle for days on end. When in use I was able to get a full day with no problem on the 5000 mAh battery with scrolling through social media websites and sending and receiving messages.

Usage might vary but using this device under normal circumstances you should be impressed with how long you can keep going without a charge. A lot of this is probably due to the MediaTek Dimensity 700 being a power-efficient SoC. Since the device runs a low refresh rate and an efficient chipset 5000 mAh will keep it alive for a longer period of time.

Adding to the quality here is the fact that the REVVL 6 Pro comes with wireless charging. While not fast it‚Äôs convenient. It‚Äôs also not something you too often see at the lower end of budget devices. In all that‚Äôs an excellent addition.

Camera

Another area the REVVL 6 Pro absolutely stunned me was the camera. In total the REVVL has four sensors. It has a 50MP main sensor 5MP ultrawide a 2MP depth camera and a 2MP macro sensor. That‚Äôs a total of four different cameras in this array. Of course the lower MP sensors like the macro and depth lenses aren‚Äôt going to blow anyone away but the main sensor is surprisingly adequate.

Every photo has a good amount of detail and is mostly color accurate with a little bit of vignetting around the corners. The ultrawide lens does a good job of capturing details as well without sacrificing function for quality.

On the front you‚Äôll find a 16MP selfie camera with a teardrop notch and while not a hole punch cutout the selfie camera still doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of room. The selfie camera takes pretty good images to my surprise as well.

The camera app itself is just fine though it can act a little slow sometimes. The REVVL 6 Pro isn‚Äôt going to be great for fast action shots as there s a bit of a delay when taking photos. For every day still shots the REVVL does a good job.

Final thoughts

All things considered the REVVL 6 Pro 5G performs just fine. Coming in at $219 you can‚Äôt expect much and going in I didn‚Äôt. Certain aspects of the REVVl 6 Pro ‚Äì like the camera and battery life ‚Äì genuinely surprised me. The camera is pretty sufficient for most applications and the battery life did not disappoint in the slightest. Sprinkled in there are a few more wonderful features like wireless charging and a physical fingerprint sensor.

As far as performance goes there could be a lot of improvement points though most woes are coming from the mid-range SoC inside the device itself. The 6GB RAM certainly helps matters and it does a decent job of keeping up with basic tasks.

If I had to pick an area I struggled with the most on the $219 REVVL I‚Äôd have to choose the screen. The resolution doesn‚Äôt lend itself to a very pleasing display and the jelly scrolling was a bit of a pain though not uncommon for this price point.

In all the REVVL 6 Pro definitely has its place. For $219 I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a pretty good phone. If it were $50 more expensive I‚Äôd feel differently about it. The camera is solid and battery life is more than plenty for most people which makes for a good combination that makes up for some other aspects.

If you were stuck on a $200 budget this is one of the better devices you could get at this price. If you‚Äôre able to go over I‚Äôd consider a Pixel 6a since it has a lot of high-end features for only $449 ‚Äì just over $200 more than the REVVL 6 Pro 5G.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRtb25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvdC1tb2JpbGUtb2ZmZXJpbmctOXRoLWdlbi1pcGFkLWF0LTUwLW9mZi_SAUlodHRwczovL3d3dy50bW9uZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4L3QtbW9iaWxlLW9mZmVyaW5nLTl0aC1nZW4taXBhZC1hdC01MC1vZmYv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile

Most sports fans have experienced slow or undependable cellular service but one venerated sports franchise aims to solve the problem.

The New York Yankees and T-Mobile announced Thursday that they have teamed up to deliver improved 5G coverage to Yankee Stadium with speeds up to five times faster than previously available.

More 5G upgrades are to come to the stadium next year the announcement said. The current Yankee Stadium opened in 2009 replacing the previous ballpark of the same name next door in the Bronx.

‚ÄúYankee Stadium is home to one of the most iconic franchises in the history of American sports‚Äù Neville Ray President of Technology at T-Mobile said in the release. ‚ÄúNow New Yorkers and people visiting from across the country to catch a game have access to ultra-fast reliable 5G so they can share more of that experience.‚Äù

Ultra Capacity 5G will be available in some parts of the stadium while LTE inside the ballpark will also be upgraded for those with older phones.

‚ÄúWe are excited to have the power of T-Mobile‚Äôs Ultra Capacity 5G network in Yankee Stadium and look forward to continuing to work together with T-Mobile to enhance the in-Stadium experience for our fans‚Äù Mike Lane the New York Yankees Chief Information Officer and Senior Vice President Technology and Broadcasting said in the release.

To mark the occasion the Yankees sent a drone around Yankee Stadium filming the concourses club level and down to the field itself into retired numbers and Monument Park. Retired Yankees greats Bernie Williams and Hideki Matsui were part of the presentation.

In addition to the newly announced Yankee Stadium deal T-Mobile has purchased naming rights in several cities. The Seattle Mariners home stadium formerly known as Safeco Field has been called T-Mobile Park since 2019 while the hockey arena in Las Vegas that hosts the NHL team Vegas Golden Knights is called T-Mobile Arena. And the sports arena in Kansas City formerly called the Sprint Center is now the T-Mobile Center following the Sprint/T-Mobile merger although that arena does not host any major league sports franchises.

The Yankees with a record of 73-45 are currently in first place in the American League East by ten games including a 42-17 record at home. However they have only won three of their last ten games and now have only the second-best record in the American League after the Houston Astros. They also have three fewer wins than their crosstown counterparts the New York Mets who are 76-42.

While most of Wall Street focuses on large-cap and mega-cap stocks as they provide a degree of safety and liquidity many investors are limited in the number of shares they can buy. Many of the biggest public companies especially the technology giants trade in the hundreds all the way up to over $1000 per share or more. At those steep prices it is difficult to get any decent share count leverage.

Many investors especially more aggressive traders look at lower-priced stocks as a way not only to make some good money but to get a higher share count. That can really help the decision-making process especially when you are on to a winner as you can always sell half and keep half.

[in-text-ad]

We screened our 24/7 Wall St. research database looking for well-known companies that could very well offer patient investors some huge returns for the rest of 2022 and beyond. Skeptics of low-priced shares should remember that at one point both Amazon and Apple traded in the single digits. One stock we featured over the years Zynga recently was purchased by Take-Two Interactive. Cogent Biosciences which we featured in March has doubled.

While all five of these stocks are rated Buy it is important to remember that no single analyst report should be used as a sole basis for any buying or selling decision.



FuboTV

This streaming company‚Äôs stock is a very solid play for gambling and it has hit the radar of the meme stock traders. FuboTV Inc. (NYSE: FUBO) is a digital entertainment company focused on offering consumers a live television streaming platform for sports news and entertainment.

It is a virtual multichannel video programming distributor that streams in 4K. Its subscription-based services are offered to consumers who can sign-up for accounts through which it provides basic plans with the flexibility for consumers to purchase the add-ons and features suited for them.



Since the start of 2022 the company has added nearly 20 FAST channels with the goal of launching approximately 100 more by the end of the year. The strategy aligns with an overall industry shift to ad-supported content as studies show consumers prefer these services over more expensive options.

Evercore ISI has an $8 target price on FuboTV stock but the consensus target is higher at $9.83. The shares last traded on Friday at $4.35 apiece which was down over 8% after a huge run last week.



IHS

Shares of this wireless tower giant have been crushed and offer huge upside potential. IHS Holding Ltd. (NYSE: IHS) owns operates and develops shared telecommunications infrastructure in Africa Latin America Europe and the Middle East. It offers colocation and lease agreement build-to-suit fiber connectivity and rural telephony solutions. The company serves mobile network operators internet service providers broadcasters security functions and private corporations.

[in-text-ad]

Including the approximately 5700 towers subject to the imminent completion of its pending deal in South Africa IHS will own nearly 39000 towers across 11 countries making the company the third largest independent multinational tower company by tower count. This geographic scale helps diversify the revenue stream and also positions IHS in some of the largest emerging markets in the world including the three largest countries in Africa and the largest Latin American country by gross domestic product.

Cowen‚Äôs $27 target price is well above the $19 consensus target for IHS stock. The shares closed on Friday at $7.32.

JetBlue

This stock has been obliterated over the past six months even though the carrier holds a very commanding position on the east coast of the United States. JetBlue Airways Corp.

The carrier serves 107 destinations in the 31 states the District of Columbia Puerto Rico the U.S. Virgin Islands and 24 countries in the Caribbean and Latin America. The company also has a strategic partnership with American Airlines to create connectivity for travelers in the Northeast.

The company announced recently a finalized deal to buy Spirit Airlines the low-cost leader airline for $3.8 billion or $33.50 per share in cash after a long battle with Frontier Airlines to finish the deal.

MKM Partners has set a $13 target price and the consensus target for the carrier is lower at $9.88. JetBlue Airways stock closed on Friday at $8.38 a share.



SoFi Technologies

This is another sizzling meme stock trader favorite. SoFi Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: SOFI) provides digital financial services and it took the SPAC route for its initial public offering back in June of 2021.

The company‚Äôs financial services allow its members to borrow save spend invest and protect their money. The company offers student loans personal loans for debt consolidation and home improvement projects and home loans.

SoFi Technologies also provides cash management investment and other related services. In addition it operates Galileo a technology platform that offers services to financial and non-financial institutions and Apex a technology-enabled platform that provides investment custody and clearing brokerage services.

Zeta Global

This company is in a white-hot business silo and and its stock has giant upside potential. Zeta Global Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: ZETA) operates an omnichannel data-driven cloud platform that provides enterprises with consumer intelligence and marketing automation software in the United States and internationally.

The company‚Äôs Zeta Marketing Platform analyzes billions of structured and unstructured data points to predict consumer intent by leveraging sophisticated machine learning algorithms and the industry‚Äôs opted-in data set for omnichannel marketing.

The $9 BofA Securities price target is less than the $12.06 consensus figure. The stock closed down over 7% on Friday at $6.46 per share.



These are five stocks for aggressive investors looking to get share count leverage on companies that have sizable upside potential. While not suited for all investors they are not penny stocks with absolutely no track record or liquidity and major Wall Street firms have research coverage.

As Matt summarised for us at the time original developer Telltale shut its doors in 2018 - and given the relative commercial failure of the original game - it seemed like a sequel might never come to pass. However Borderlands developer Gearbox surprised everyone back in April when it announced that a follow-up wasn't just in the works but would be out by the end of the year.

But the worst may be over,"New York CNN Business ‚Äî

Target just demonstrated how quickly things can change in the world of retail posting a terrible quarter after nearly two years of soaring profits and record revenue growth. But the big box retailer is promising things will change in the other direction just as fast.

Target was widely seen as one of the winners of the pandemic gaining new customers as shoppers not wanting to go into brick-and-mortar stores were drawn to its growing curbside pickup and home delivery.

But after a disappointing fiscal first quarter when profits fell 40% Target just had an even worse second quarter. Profits plunged 90% compared to a year earlier.

Inflation-weary shoppers shifted to buying essentials such as food and gas rather than ‚Äúnonessential‚Äù general merchandise that is central to Target‚Äôs sales and profits. It was a stark contrast to larger rival Walmart (WMT) which posted only a narrow drop in profits for the quarter.

But many analysts believe Target is still in good position going forward that it‚Äôs not at risk of joining some of the other pandemic winners who are now struggling like online retailer Wayfair (W). Friday it announced it had to cut 5% of the staff due to expanding too fast during the good times.

Target‚Äôs profit plunge came from the deep discounts it had to offer on much of its general merchandise such as clothing electronics and home goods. The hit to earnings from such deep discounting was unavoidable. But company executives insist it was the right choice.

‚ÄúConsider the alternative: we could have held on to excess inventory and attempted to deal with it slowly over multiple quarters or even years. While that might have reduced the near-term financial impact it would have held back our business over time‚Äù said CEO Brian Cornell to investors. ‚ÄúThe vast majority of the financial impact of these inventory actions is now behind us.‚Äù He predicts a meaningful improvement in operating margin rates in the fall season.

Many analysts agree that Target did the right thing taking the hit. Several say the sudden shift in consumer buying habits was not the fault of miscalculation by management.

‚ÄúAll last year the supply chain was very very tight. Stores were out of stock of many items. They were ordering for a level of demand that was very reasonable‚Äù said Bobby Griffin retail analyst at Raymond James. ‚ÄúThen there was a very fast change in consumer behavior.‚Äù

Discretionary purchases being made by consumers shifted away from goods to things like travel Griffin said.

Other experts say that Target management wasn‚Äôt quite blameless for being caught with too much of the wrong inventory.

‚ÄúMy sense is that this [problem at Target] was 70% about consumer behavior and 30% miscalculation related to inventory‚Äù said Eric Schiffer chief investment officer of Los Angeles-based private equity firm The Patriarch Organization.

There is some hope for all retailers that they could benefit from the large steady decline in gas prices over the last two months.

The national average price of gasoline has dropped $1.11 or 22% to $3.91 since hitting a record of $5.02 on June 14. It has fallen every day since. That should save households $100 a month on average. And wholesale gasoline futures point to even lower gas prices ahead in the coming weeks and months.

Target was always going to have more problems with a sudden shift in consumer spending than Walmart. Walmart has more than half of its sales from grocery while Target is closer to 20% said Owen Chen retail analyst at Cowen. Walmart also had to offer sales on its nonessential general merchandise in the quarter.

And Walmart has always competed more on low prices an advantage at a time that even middle and higher income shoppers are concerned about higher prices. Walmart executives reported it saw more business from those upper income households in the most recent quarter a statement that cheered its investors.

But Chen said the numbers indicate that they did not get those higher income shoppers from Target‚Äôs traditional customers.

‚ÄúI think that Target‚Äôs [store] traffic numbers show it did a good job holding onto their customers‚Äù he said. The number of customers making purchases at Target was up 2.7% compared to a year ago in the just-completed quarter. And that‚Äôs more than a 20% increase since the same period of 2019 ahead of the pandemic.

Target shares have underperformed some of its rivals falling 28% so far this year compared to only a 5% decline at Walmart. Schiffer said he wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see the slide in Target shares continue as he believes they are overvalued by as much as 30%. But he doesn‚Äôt think that means Target is badly positioned for the future.

‚ÄúI would stay the course‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe pace of growth during the pandemic was never going to be sustainable. They‚Äôll still grow just not as fast.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2Nic2F1c3Rpbi5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQvcHJhbmtzdGVycy1wdXQtdXAtZmFrZS1zaWduLW9mLWEtdGFyZ2V0LWNvbWluZy1zb29uLWluLXNtYWxsLXRvd24tbG9jYWwtc2FuLWFudG9uaW8tdGV4YXPSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly9jYnNhdXN0aW4uY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC9wcmFua3N0ZXJzLXB1dC11cC1mYWtlLXNpZ24tb2YtYS10YXJnZXQtY29taW5nLXNvb24taW4tc21hbGwtdG93bi1sb2NhbC1zYW4tYW50b25pby10ZXhhcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pranksters put up fake sign of a Target 'coming soon' in small town,"What appeared to be a big announcement about a new Target store going up in Marshalltown Iowa stirred up a lot of buzz this week. It was exciting news for a small town where the nearest Target is about 45 minutes away. The only problem was the sign was a prank!

If the prank revealed anything it's that a whole lot of people here in Marshalltown would love having a Target. To get to the nearest Target it's a 36-mile drive on Duff Avenue in Ames.

This is the sign that played with people's hearts and stirred up the small talk and this is the sign that broke those hearts.

The coming soon promise was only a prank.



""I think a lot of people would think it's super mean. Cuz I know a lot of people would love to have a target here. I know a lot of people would think it's very funny because they know for a fact there's no way on earth that there'd be a target here in Marshalltown"" said Aryana Ordaz.

That sentiment seems to be shared around town. It'd be nice but it just didn't seem believable.

""For a target to pop up right here on 3rd avenue would be kind of woohoo nah not gonna happen"" said Julie Johnson. ""Oh my god I would love for a Target to be across the street. I would love it.""

Unity point sent us a statement saying in part that this was someone's ""light-hearted prank and the covering has been removed. We can confirm that we haven't had any discussions with Target corporation about a new store location and our property remains for sale.""

That means Target still requires a trip.



""There were several people with their hopes up to have a Target here"" said Rochelle Thomas. She tells the prankster ""You're not very nice. You wasted a lot of people's time and dreams.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3MS5yZXRhaWx0b3VjaHBvaW50cy5jb20vYS8yMDIyLWRlc2lnbnJldGFpbC00MC11bmRlci00MC1hd2FyZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 design:retail 40 Under 40 Awards,Retail TouchPoints and design:retail give all members of the retail world access to a vibrant community that combines insights inspiration and opportunities to interact with their peers.

Hearing Aid Penny Stocks

Eargo (NASDAQ: EAR)

Eargo is a hearing aid manufacturer based in San Jose California.

The company‚Äôs stock charts tell an interesting story.

Ergo went public in October 2020 opening at about ~$30. It reached all-time highs of around $70 per share. Unfortunately after the 2021 market downturn this stock took a tumble.

It‚Äôs been in the penny stock range since about September 2021.

Eargo does have a lot going for it that could help the company regain some of its lost momentum.

Its devices use a very innovative design that is inspired by a fishing fly. This has allowed it to produce virtually invisible hearing aids.

These hearing aids have several features that make them very comfortable. They also provide very crisp sound quality.

Eargo‚Äôs hearing aids are fully rechargeable and come with a portable charging device.

The company even offers a custom calibration option.

Its devices are also very sleek which has made them very popular among children and young adults who need hearing support.

Recent legislation allows customers to buy hearing aids without a prescription from their doctor.

This has made it much easier for people with moderate hearing loss to get the care they need with prescription hearing aids. It also allows Innerscope Hearing Technologies to tap into a broader range of consumers.

Over the next few years we could expect to see the hearing aid market grow as a result ‚Äî especially since access is broadening.

All in all Innerscope Hearing Technologies stock provides the opportunity to invest in a growing company that has a lot to offer in the hearing market.

Hearing Aid Stocks That Pay Dividends

Sonova stock has performed very well this past year.

While its shares initially dropped during the March 2020 stock market crash they had recovered by September.

This company doesn‚Äôt pay a huge dividend but it can still be a good source of long-term income.

Since Sonova is such a respected name in the hearing aid market it could be a great buy for portfolio stability.

There is consistent demand for its products which is reflected in the company‚Äôs financials. This is why Sonova is on our list of the top hearing aid stocks.

Energizer Holdings (NYSE: ENR)

It was a part of Spectrum Brands until 2019 when the company sold it to Energizer.

Energizer stock has been up and down over the past several years.

However they have recovered well from the Coronavirus pandemic and the resulting stock market crash.

Since batteries are an important consumer staple it‚Äôs likely that this stock will be able to weather through tough economic times.

These factors could make it a great stock to buy and hold for the long run.

Should You Buy Hearing Aid Stocks?

Hearing aid stocks access a unique vantage point in the medical device and healthcare markets.

The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 466 million people around the world struggle with some form of disabling hearing impairment or loss.

There‚Äôs also a huge percentage of the population who could benefit from using hearing aids but don‚Äôt currently use one.

This means the hearing aid industry is full of untapped potential.

Companies in this industry can expand into new locations and use new marketing strategies to ensure they‚Äôre reaching the right target audience.

Recently in the US it‚Äôs become much easier for people to access the hearing aid technology they need.

In 2020 Congress passed legislation that allows people with mild hearing loss to purchase hearing devices over the counter.

Before patients with hearing loss would need to see a doctor to obtain the hearing aids they needed.

This presents a huge opportunity for companies that can sell over-the-counter products like some of the companies we mentioned.

Final Thoughts

Since hearing devices are essential for so many people it makes sense to invest in the companies that make them.

Hearing aid stocks are a great investment opportunity even during challenging economic times.

The target attained in June has motivated the government to advance the target of 20 per cent blending by five years to accomplish by 2025. 20 percent Ethanol blending reduced carbon monoxide emissions by 50% in two-wheelers and 30% in four-wheelers.(NITI Aayog)

Ethanol mixing is said to reduce environmental degradation while adding extra income to the pocket of farmers. It will help India achieve its dream of self-reliance in the energy sector. Here we chalk down the prominent points about the emerging technology.

What is Ethanol blending ?

Ethanol (also called ethyl alcohol or alcohol) is a biofuel with chemical formula C2H5OH. It is naturally made by the fermentation of sugar. In India it is largely derived while extracting sugar from sugarcane. However other organic matter like food grains can also be used for its production.

The government has launched the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme to mix this biofuel with petrol to reduce the consumption of fossil fuel. The E10 target achievement means that the petrol we use now has 10 percent ethanol mixed in it.

Why is ethanol mixing important ?

India has put forward the audacious goal of considerable cutting in carbon footprint. However in pursuit of the goal its dependency on fossil fuel is a major roadblock. According to 2021 data published by NITI Aayog in report titled ‚ÄòRoadmap for Ethanol blending in India 2020-25‚Äô 98 per cent of the fuel requirement in the road transportation sector is currently met by fossil fuels and while only 2% by biofuels.

As ethanol supports complete combustion the report points out that higher reductions in carbon monoxide emissions were observed with E20 fuel‚Äì50% lower in two-wheelers and 30% lower in four-wheelers. Hydrocarbon emissions scaled down by 20% but nitrous oxide emissions did not show a substantial trend as it depended on the vehicle/engine type and engine operating conditions.

India is highly dependent on other countries to fulfil its energy demand. The report states that of the total oil requirement in the transportation sector 85 percent need to be imported.

On the other hand there is a continuous rise in vehicles. The vehicle population in the country is around 22 crore o two and three wheelers and around 3.6 crore four-wheelers which is estimated to increase at around 8-10% per annum as estimated by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).

Apart from these the alternative use-case of sugarcane will help the farmers realise more income on their produce. Also the surplus and damaged rice procured by the Food Corporation of India can be used to produce ethanol.

Problems in adoption of Ethanol blending fuel

Availability of sufficient raw material sustainably is required. Sugarcane is a water intensive crop so promoting its cultivation may deplete our groundwater. Research on non-sugarcane derived ethanol needs to be undertaken.

Sugarcane is locally available in only some parts of India thus the supply chain needs to be strengthened to accomplish the Interstate movement of ethanol.

There is a need for the development of infrastructure to extract ethanol. It requires ethanol compliant dispensing units and additional storage tanks for ethanol at marketing terminals / depots.

There is a requirement of upgrading the vehicle engines to make it compliant with Ethanol blending. Although no significant change is required for 10% mixing engines and components will need to be tested and calibrated with E20 as fuel."

Today space system designers and developers are truly embracing the SpaceVPX (VITA 78) standard which leverages the OpenVPX (VITA 65.0) architecture through its slot profile and module profile level building blocks which create interconnect solutions based on the user‚Äôs need.

Explore the basics of SpaceVPX with the designers of the VPX and SpaceVPX interconnect. Learn about the standard‚Äôs origin the advantages of SpaceVPX vs. OpenVPX recent changes to the standard and the importance of standard interconnects which drive down cost results in a more robust supply chain and maintains a path for future expansion.

What is SpaceVPX?

SpaceVPX is a standard for creating plug-in cards (PICs) from its slot profile and module (protocol) profiles. In turn these building blocks create interconnected subsystems and systems. Developed under the auspices of The Next Generation Space Interconnect Standard (NGSIS) it is the result of a government-Industry collaboration. The primary goal of SpaceVPX is to cost-effectively remove bandwidth as a constraint for future space systems.

SpaceVPX is based on the VITA (VMEbus International Trade Association) OpenVPX standard with enhancements that extend the standard for space applications.

The NGSIS team selected the OpenVPX standard family as the physical baseline for the new SpaceVPX standard because VPX supports both 3U and 6U form factors with ruggedized and conduction-cooled features suitable for use in extreme environments. The infrastructure of OpenVPX also allows for prototyping and testing SpaceVPX on the ground.

SpaceVPX is built upon several standards some of which are part of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/VITA and European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS) OpenVPX family:

VITA 46 VPX and its ANSI/VITA 65.0 OpenVPX derivative ‚Äì baseline standard

ANSI/VITA 60 and ANSI/VITA 63 ‚Äì compatible connectors

ANSI/VITA 48.2[3] ‚Äì mechanical extensions

ANSI/VITA 62 ‚Äì standardized power module

ANSI/VITA 66 and 67 ‚Äì replacement of electrical segments with RF or optical solutions

ANSI/VITA 46.11[4] ‚Äì management protocol the basis for fault-tolerant management of the SpaceVPX system

ECSS ‚Äì SpaceWire standard

ECSS ‚Äì Remote Memory Access Protocol (RMAP)

ECSS ‚Äì SpaceFibre standard

Gigabit Ethernet

What is OpenVPX?

OpenVPX is a defined set of system implementations within VPX that specifies a set of system architectures. OpenVPX organizes connections in four major interconnect planes ‚Äî data control utility and expansion.

Data Plane

The data plane incorporates high-speed multigigabit fabric connections between modules to carry payload and mission data.

Control Plane

The control plane also a fabric connection typically has less capacity and is used for configuration setup diagnostics and other operational control functions within the payload and for lower-speed data transfers.

Utility Plane

The utility plane provides setup and control of basic module functions for power sequencing low-level diagnostics clocks and other base signals needed for system operation.

Expansion Plane

The expansion plane may be used as a separate connection between modules using similar interfaces or to bridge heritage interfaces in a more limited topology such as a bus or ring.

Pins not defined as part of any of these planes are typically user-defined and are available for pass-through from daughter or mezzanine cards or to rear transition modules (RTM). For maximum module reuse the user-defined pins should be configurable so as not to interfere with modules that use the same pins in a different way. Consult ANSI/VITA 65.0 for more detail.

The Limitations of OpenVPX for Space Applications

An evaluation of OpenVPX for space usage revealed several shortcomings. The key limitation was the lack of features available to support a full single-fault-tolerant highly reliable configuration. Utility signals were bused and in most cases supported only one set of signals via signal pins to a module. As a result a pure OpenVPX system has opportunities for multiple failures. Additionally a full management-control mechanism was not fully defined with VITA 46.11.

From a protocol perspective SpaceWire is the dominant medium-speed data and control plane interface for most spacecraft yet the typical OpenVPX control planes are peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) or Ethernet which are not generally used in space applications. (Note: Gigabit Ethernet was added to the 2022 revision of the SpaceVPX standard.)

SpaceVPX Mission: Fault Tolerance

The goal of SpaceVPX is to achieve an acceptable level of fault tolerance while maintaining a reasonable level of compatibility with existing OpenVPX components including connector-pin assignments for the board and the backplane (Figure 1.).

Figure 1 | The goal of SpaceVPX is to achieve an acceptable level of fault tolerance by way of redundancy and switching. Illustration: VITA.

For the purposes of fault tolerance a module (defined as a printed wire assembly which conforms to defined mechanical and electrical specifications) is considered the minimum redundancy element or the minimum fault containment region. The utility plane and control plane within SpaceVPX are all distributed redundantly and are arranged in star topologies dual-star topologies partial-mesh topologies or full-mesh topologies to provide fault tolerance to the entire system.

To meet the desired level of fault tolerance the utility plane signals must be dual-redundant and switched to each SpaceVPX card function.

A trade study conducted in 2010 through a government and industry collaboration with the support of the SpaceVPX Working Group compared various implementations including adding the switching to each card in various ways and creating a unique switching card. The latter approach was selected so SpaceVPX cards can each receive the same utility plane signals that an OpenVPX card receives with minor adjustments for any changes in topology. This became known as the Space Utility Management module (SpaceUM) a major foundation of the SpaceVPX standard.

A 6U SpaceUM module contains up to eight sets of power and signal switches to support eight SpaceVPX payload modules ‚Äî the 3U version of the SpaceUM can support up to five. It receives one power bus from each of two power supplies and one set of utility plane signals from each of two system controller functions required in the SpaceVPX backplane. The various parts of the SpaceUM module do not require their own redundancy. They are considered extensions of the power supply system controller and other SpaceVPX modules for reliability calculation.

Profiles for Space Defined

Each slot module and backplane profile in OpenVPX is fully defined and interlinked. Adapting these profiles for use in space requires specification of a SpaceVPX version of each profile.

Slot Profile A slot profile provides a physical mapping of data ports onto a slot‚Äôs backplane connector which is agnostic to the type of protocol used to convey data from the slot to the backplane.

Module and Backplane Profiles

Module profiles are extensions of their accompanying slot profiles which enable mapping of protocols to each module port. A module profile includes information on thermal power and mechanical requirements for each module. Some module profiles for SpaceVPX are similar to OpenVPX which enables use of OpenVPX modules and backplanes for prototyping or testing on the ground. However most module profiles for space applications are significantly different from profiles for ground applications so full specifications consistent with SpaceVPX are required. The section of the SpaceVPX standard that defines these profiles forms a majority of the standard.

Standardized SpaceVPX Interconnects

Interconnects are one more critical part of SpaceVPX. As with other elements of the standard they are based on interconnects developed for OpenVPX but designed for the extreme space environment.

Problematic temperatures vibration outgassing and other factors can catastrophically compromise interconnect systems as well as signal and power integrity. For decades designers for space applications have relied on customized interconnect designs to ensure the reliability of embedded electronics exposed to the extremes of space. The high cost and long lead times of a custom interconnect solution were once considered a worthwhile investment against failures that are extremely costly or impossible to fix in space.

Today the use of standard interconnects drives down cost improves availability and maintains a path for future expansion.

By leveraging the OpenVPX architecture SpaceVPX brings in the interconnect solutions which are defined in VITA standards and have gone through extensive testing to support their use in space.

The SpaceVPX slot profiles define the use of VPX connectors (VITA 46 or alternate VPX connectors) and enable implementation of RF (VITA 67) and optical (VITA 66) modules at the plug-in module to backplane interface. Power supplies follow the VITA 62 standard which also defines the power supply connector interface. For XMC mezzanine cards in plug-in modules XMC 2.0 connectors per VITA 61 are recommended. Rather than defining new connectors with special characteristics SpaceVPX slot profiles reference the appropriate VITA connector standards that support the OpenVPX architecture.

VITA 46 VPX Connectors

The VITA 46 VPX connector is the original VPX interconnect. It is based on TE Connectivity‚Äôs (TE) MULTIGIG RT 2 connector which was released in the VITA 46 standard in 2006.

The MULTIGIG RT connector family gives designers an easy-to-implement modular standardized and cost-effective interconnect system that helps ensure the reliability of their embedded-computing applications for space systems.

MULTIGIG RT connectors have gone through extensive testing by TE to establish suitability for space including:

Compliant (press-fit) pin technology

Testing has been performed at min-max board hole sizes and different printed circuit board (PCB) platings to verify the reliability of the compliant pin designs. Today numerous space applications use compliant pin technology (as compared to traditional soldered connections) and implementation is increasing.

The VITA 72 study group was formed to address extreme vibration applications. The group devised a vibration test that subjected a 6U VPX test unit to random vibration levels of 0.2 g2/Hz for 12 hours a severe requirement compared to the original VPX standard. TE‚Äôs MULTIGIG RT 2-R connector ‚Äî featuring an enhanced quad-redundant backplane connector contact system and rugged guide hardware ‚Äî tested successfully as part of this effort and has been used in highly rugged applications since 2013.

Extreme temperature

MULTIGIG connectors were subjected to a temperature range of -55 ÀöC to +105 ÀöC when initially qualified for VPX in 2006 which met the VITA 47 standard for plug-in modules. In direct response to requirements from space-systems developers MULTIGIG RT connectors have since been tested and survived -55 ¬∞C to +125 ¬∞C including exposure to 1000 hours of heat at 125 ¬∞C and 100 thermal shock cycles from -55 ¬∞C to +125 ¬∞C.

Outgassing

Unlike heavy polymer plug-in module connectors used in conventional backplane connector designs MULTIGIG RT connectors incorporate air gaps so less polymer is required. The polymer reduction reduces weight and decreases outgassing. With MULTIGIG RT connector materials total mass loss (TML) is less than 1% and collected volatile condensable materials (CVCM) is less than 0.01% which meets NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) outgassing requirements.

Current capacity

When VITA 78 was developed there was a need for VPX connectors to support new pinouts (not defined in VITA 46) to support the requirements for redundant power distribution and redundant management distribution. TE completed extensive testing for current carrying capability on multiple adjacent MULTIGIG power wafers within plug-in module connectors and also released new wafer configurations to support the VITA 78 Space Utility Management module architecture.

Most space system designers use MULTIGIG RT connectors to meet their requirements with no physical change to the design or materials and finishes. If minimal changes are required (e.g. higher lead content [40%] in the contact tails is specified for increased tin-whisker mitigation) additional screening tests are required based on the user or program requirements but the connector-manufacturing processes are relatively the same which helps improve cost and availability.

RF and Optical Modules

RF and optical connector modules can be integrated within an OpenVPX slot to carry signals through the backplane to/from the plug-in module. These connector modules are mounted to the boards (including standard aperture cutouts on the backplane) to house multiple coaxial contacts or optical fibers. They can replace select VITA 46 connectors within a slot. These RF and optical connector modules and contacts have been used in satellite systems and are suitable for other applications in space.

VITA 67 is the base standard for RF modules. VITA 67.3 is used for SpaceVPX architecture with apertures defined within specific slot profiles for RF and optical connector modules. VITA 67.3 offers coaxial contact solutions with the initial sub-miniature push-on micro (SMPM) contacts as well as higher-density coaxial interfaces NanoRF and switched-mode power supply (SMPS) which can increase the contact density two to three times over SMPM. A new revision to VITA 67.3 has begun to add 75 Ohm coaxial interfaces to support higher speed video.

VITA 66 is the base standard for optical modules with MT ferrules as the primary optical interface between the plug-in module and backplane. The apertures in SpaceVPX slot profiles accommodate optical and hybrid RF/optical connector modules meeting the requirements of VITA 66.5. MT interfaces can be specified for 12 or 24 fibers for highest density.

XMC Connectors

XMC mezzanine cards can be implemented on SpaceVPX plug-in modules to add I/O and other features. VITA 61 XMC 2.0 the standard based on TE‚Äôs Mezalok connector is the recommended XMC connector in the SpaceVPX standard. The Mezalok connector features multiple points of contact per pin supporting the redundancy required for space applications. The connector meets outgassing requirements and has been tested to extreme environments ‚Äî including 2000 thermal cycles from -55 ¬∫C to +125 ¬∫C with no solder joint failures.

The Future of SpaceVPX Interconnects

By leveraging the OpenVPX architecture SpaceVPX can also leverage the OpenVPX interconnect roadmap which addresses solutions having faster speeds higher density smaller size and lighter weight. There is significant activity with new and revised VITA standards to define technologies supporting next-generation embedded computing.

Higher data rate MULTIGIG RT 3 connectors are available and standardized in VITA 46.30 (compliant pin) and 46.31 (solder tail) to support channels to 25-32 Gigabits per second supporting 100G Ethernet and PCI Gen 4 and 5. These can be incorporated in a SpaceVPX slot replacing VITA 46.0 connectors.

The latest revision of the VITA 67.3 standard includes higher-density RF interfaces NanoRF and SMPS reducing size and weight ‚Äî both of which are critical for space systems ‚Äî and accommodating higher frequencies to 70 GHz. A new revision to VITA 67.3 has begun to add 75 Ohm coaxial interfaces within a connector module to support higher speed video protocols.

The VITA 66.5 standard will be released in 2022 documenting higher-density optical interfaces bringing up to three MT interfaces into a half-module and enabling integration of a fixed edge-mount transceiver. In addition VITA 66.5 provides solutions with NanoRF contacts and optical MTs integrated into a common connector module providing unprecedented density within an OpenVPX slot.

New VITA 62 power supply standards have addressed three-phase power (VITA 62.1) and higher 270VDC input voltages (VITA 62.2). New MULTIBEAM XLE connectors from TE with isolating fins provide this upgrade for higher voltage levels while maintaining the same VITA 62.0 interface.

RealRusty

A Tesla's Autopilot system appeared to confuse a horse-drawn carriage for a truck a video shows.

The video by YouTuber RealRusty also seems to show the carriage being identified as a car and a human.

It's unclear whether Autopilot's designers have accounted for historic forms of transport.

A video posted by a Tesla driver appears to show his car's Autopilot system confusing a horse-drawn carriage for a truck.

The video posted by Swiss YouTuber RealRusty shows his Tesla approaching a horse-drawn carriage on a highway outside Zurich Switzerland before it's misidentified as several other modes of transport.

The system appears to briefly identify the carriage as a car a human a human walking behind a car a human walking behind a truck and as a truck on its own.

At one point when the carriage is apparently misidentified as a truck Autopilot shows the ""truck"" spinning around as if it's destined for a head-on collision with the Tesla.

""We were driving in our Tesla Model Y when this horse-drawn carriage appeared in front of us. Unable to pass we stayed behind and watched as Tesla's visualization tried to spot it"" RealRusty told ViralHog.

He added: ""Starting with a motorcycle to a car to a truck backing up it was all there! Fortunately we recorded it all with the smartphone.""

Tesla didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Tesla's Autopilot function is designed to detect vehicles pedestrians and other objects in the car's vicinity and take evasive action if needed.

It's unclear whether Autopilot's designers included a horse-drawn carriage as one of the vehicles the system can detect.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9idXNpbmVzcy90ZXNsYS1mc2QtdGVzdHMta2lkcy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFAaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wOC8yMS9idXNpbmVzcy90ZXNsYS1mc2QtdGVzdHMta2lkcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,People are now testing Tesla's 'full self-driving' on real kids,"Washington DC CNN ‚Äî

Carmine Cupani wanted to set the record straight. So he asked his young son to stand in the path of his Tesla as it sped through a parking lot.

The North Carolina resident set out to refute a widely circulated video of a Tesla with the company‚Äôs ‚Äúfull self-driving‚Äù beta software ‚Äì which allows the car to steer brake and accelerate but requires an attentive human driver ready to take the wheel ‚Äì plowing into child-size mannequins.

Dan O‚ÄôDowd a software company CEO who published the video earlier this month thinks the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should ban ‚Äúfull self-driving‚Äù until Tesla CEO Elon Musk ‚Äúproves it won‚Äôt mow down children.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when Cupani who runs an auto shop focused on imports and Teslas got involved and recruited his son. While he‚Äôs a self-described ‚ÄúBMW guy‚Äù Cupani says the software can‚Äôt compare to what Tesla offers. It also wasn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôd enlisted his son who Cupani said is 11 years old in a potentially viral car endeavor: Earlier this year he posted a video of his son driving his Model S Plaid ‚Äî which can reach 0-60 in 1.99 seconds ‚Äî in a private parking lot. It‚Äôs been viewed more than 250000 times.

‚ÄúSome people look at it and say ‚ÄòOh this crazy dad what is he doing?‚Äô‚Äù Cupani told CNN Business. ‚ÄúWell I do a lot of stuff like that but I‚Äôm going to make sure my kid doesn‚Äôt get hit.‚Äù

Carmine Cupani and his 11-year-old son performed a test to see if Tesla's ""full self-driving"" would stop for a child in the road (Cupani's son is seen here in the distance). Courtesy Carmine's Import Service

Cupani filmed the test of ‚Äúfull self-driving‚Äù in a parking lot. His son stood near the end of an aisle holding a smartphone to film the test. Cupani accelerated the Tesla from the other side of the lot and turned on ‚Äúfull self-driving‚Äù reaching 35 mph. The Tesla braked steadily and came to a full stop ‚Äì well ahead of his son.

The BBC Grand National 2001 - Red Marauder

Cupani did another test with his son on a street using Autopilot the more rudimentary Tesla driver-assist software and found it stopped for his son too. ‚ÄúThis Dan guy he says he‚Äôs an expert in this expert in that‚Äù Cupani said. ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm an expert in automotive future technology pro driving instructor.‚Äù

Cupani is among the many Tesla supporters who took issue with O‚ÄôDowd‚Äôs video and set out to create their own tests. Some asked their children to help. Others built homemade mannequins or used blow-up dolls.

The passionate defenses and criticism of ‚Äúfull self-driving‚Äù highlight how the technology has become a flashpoint in the industry. The California DMV recently said the name ‚Äúfull self-driving‚Äù is deceptive and grounds for suspending or revoking Tesla‚Äôs license to sell vehicles in the state. Ralph Nader whose 1960s criticism of the auto industry helped spark the creation of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) joined a chorus of critics of ‚Äúfull self-driving‚Äù this month.

But it also is yet another example of the unintended consequence of deploying an unfinished disruptive technology in the wild ‚Äì and shows how far some Tesla believers are willing to go to defend it and the company. Enough people appeared to be pursuing their own experiments that one government agency took the extraordinary step of warning people not to use children to test a car‚Äôs technology.

‚ÄúConsumers should never attempt to create their own test scenarios or use real people and especially children to test the performance of vehicle technology‚Äù NHTSA said in a statement Wednesday. The agency called this approach ‚Äúhighly dangerous.‚Äù

Testing Teslas

Earlier this month California resident Tad Park saw that another Tesla enthusiast wanted to test ‚Äúfull self-driving‚Äù with a child and volunteered two of his children. Park told CNN Business it was a ‚Äúlittle tough‚Äù to get his wife to agree. She agreed when he promised to drive the vehicle.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm never going to push the limits because my kids are way more valuable to me than anything‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to risk their lives in any way.‚Äù

Park‚Äôs tests unlike O‚ÄôDowd‚Äôs started with the Tesla at 0 mph. The Tesla stopped in all of Park‚Äôs tests ahead of two of his children involved in the video including a 5-year-old. Park said he wasn‚Äôt comfortable doing a higher speed test of 40 mph ‚Äì like O‚ÄôDowd performed using the mannequins ‚Äì with his kids.

Toronto resident Franklin Cadamuro created a ‚Äúbox boy‚Äù a childlike form crafted from old Amazon cardboard boxes. ‚ÄúDo not blame me for what the car does or doesn‚Äôt do‚Äù he posted at the beginning of his video. ‚ÄúI am a big Tesla Fan.‚Äù

His Tesla slowed as it approached ‚Äúbox boy.‚Äù Then it sped up again and struck his cardboard mannequin. Cadamuro speculated that this could be because the cameras could not see the short boxes once they were immediately in front of the bumper and therefore forget they were there.

Human babies learn at about eight months that an object out of sight still exists many years before qualifying for a driver‚Äôs license. But the ability may still elude some artificial intelligence systems like Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äúfull self-driving.‚Äù Another Tesla fan found a similar result.

Cadamuro said his video started as entertainment. But he wanted people to see that ‚Äúfull self-driving‚Äù isn‚Äôt perfect.

‚ÄúI find a lot of people have two extreme thoughts of the ‚Äòfull self-driving‚Äô beta‚Äù Cadamuro said. ‚ÄúPeople like Dan think it‚Äôs the worst thing in the world. I know some friends who think it‚Äôs near perfect.‚Äù

Cadamuro said he also performed other tests in which his Tesla traveling at higher speeds effectively steered around ‚Äúbox boy.‚Äù

Detecting smaller objects like young children quickly and accurately will generally be more difficult than sensing large objects and adults for a computer vision system like what Tesla vehicles rely on according to Raj Rajkumar a Carnegie Mellon University professor who researches autonomous vehicles.

The more pixels an object takes up in a camera image the more information the system has to detect features and identify the object. The system will also be impacted by the data it is trained on such as how many images of small children it‚Äôs exposed to.

‚ÄúComputer vision with machine learning is not 100% foolproof‚Äù Rajkumar said. ‚ÄúJust like diagnosis of a disease there are always false positives and negatives.‚Äù

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment and generally does not engage with the professional news media.

‚ÄúWild West chaos rules‚Äù

Following criticism from Tesla fans of his original tests O‚ÄôDowd released another video this month.

Some Tesla supporters had criticized O‚ÄôDowd‚Äôs use of cones as lane markings in his original testing which may have limited the sedan‚Äôs ability to steer around the mannequin. Others claimed that O‚ÄôDowd‚Äôs test driver had forced the Tesla to strike the mannequin by pushing the accelerator which wasn‚Äôt visible in videos O‚ÄôDowd released. Some Tesla enthusiasts also pointed to a blurry messages on the screen of the Tesla vehicle as an indication that O‚ÄôDowd‚Äôs test driver was pushing the accelerator to rig the tests.

O‚ÄôDowd told CNN Business that the blurry messages referred to supercharging being unavailable and to uneven tire wear. CNN Business could not independently verify what the message said as O‚ÄôDowd provided no crisper video of what happened in car during the tests.

In his second video O‚ÄôDowd‚Äôs tested without cones on a residential street and showed the interior of the Tesla including the accelerator pedal. The Tesla as in O‚ÄôDowd‚Äôs other tests struck the child mannequin.

Everything is real except the child bc you know what would happen to a real child! pic.twitter.com/a3ut9bpSqG ‚Äî Dan O'Dowd (@RealDanODowd) August 15 2022

O‚ÄôDowd lamented earlier this year in an interview with CNN Business that no industry testing body examines the code for ‚Äúfull self-driving.‚Äù The US government has no performance standards for automated driver-assist technology like Autopilot.

My First Experience With My New Tesla Model 3

I just got a new Tesla Model 3 RWD with LFP batteries. I've been wanting a Tesla for about 10 years now and finally am in a position to afford one. It's a very exciting time for me as I am upgrading from a 14 year old Honda Fit to the Model 3. Here's what my experience has been like from delivery to the first 24 hours.

First off the process of getting into a place to accept delivery is very simple. The Tesla app makes all of this simple by taking you through a series of steps once your delivery date gets close. For the first 7 months of waiting to take delivery of my car it was simply refreshing the delivery date. As it got close to the end of August it became time to take delivery of my car and the app let me know of the next steps to take.

The next steps were:

I needed to either get insurance through an insurance company or use Tesla insurance. Fortunately I live in Utah which was just recently added by Tesla for insurance. I was able to sign up for insurance using the app and my initial premium is $95. That is about $15 less than my current insurance company's quote! The insurance premium for the first two months uses a safety score of 90 and after two months my current safety score will determine my premium.

The safety score is a genius idea. It uses how close you drive to cars how aggressively you turn how often you force autopilot to disengage how hard you brake and how many forward collision warnings you get. All of these are Tesla's ways of determining a safe driver by NOT having incidents in these areas which will cause your safety score to go up. Mine got as high as 98 and it showed my premium down to $65 from $95. At a score of 100 perhaps the premium goes to $58 or $55. That's nearly a 50% decrease in monthly premium for safe driving. Sign me up! That would put my insurance cost less than my old Honda Fit!

Other steps included accepting a loan agreement and putting down money for my down payment. It was easy to connect my bank and submit the down payment and accept the terms of the loan agreement. There were a few other steps as well.

Delivery Day and Beyond

On delivery day I got a text message and a final set of documents to review and sign through the Tesla app. I accept those terms and then waited in the Tesla service center where I was next in line. After about 15 minutes waiting a Tesla employee came up to me and showed me to my car which had its hazard lights on in the parking lot.

He gave me an envelope with some key cards which I can use in the event that my phone is dead to get into my car. Pairing those key cards was easy - I used the app and simply swiped the car on the center arm rest of the car. Pairing my phone was also easy and that is the primary way I will open my car.

Opening and locking the car is very easy. Just walk close to your car and it unlocks. Just walk away from your car and it locks. I always watch my car as I walk away and am sure it locks before I let my vision leave it.

It took me and my daughters about 20 minutes in the Tesla to figure everything out. We research online how to turn the hazard lights off in our Model 3 and it turns out to turn the hazard lights off you simply press the triangle button right above the rear view mirror. We laughed at how long it took us to figure that out and how simple it was.

Driving the Model 3 RWD has been a joy. Even with it being the lowest end Tesla it still packs a punch in acceleration. Flooring the accelerator takes a lot of energy though as does going up hills. In fact driving on the freeway takes more energy than city driving the reverse of how it is for a gas car. I think this is due to less energy being used for speed and more regenerative braking.

Speaking of regenerative braking I rarely if ever have had to use the brake. By taking my foot off the accelerator the car naturally brakes as if I was pressing the brake pedal. It took a little bit of getting used to but now I like it. The brakes on the car will likely last forever.

There are NO issues with the car. Everything is in working order and I've driven it about 150 miles in the last 24 hours and have been having so much fun with it. I don't have a charger at my condo where I live so I am working out how I will charge it. I went to a Tesla Supercharger here during peak hours and it was pretty expensive for 25% - about $7.50. I imagine charging at night or early morning will cost a lot less.

I feel like I own a space ship now and this is much better than my gas car - by leaps and bounds. I see maintenance being largely washer fluid tires and an occasional replacement for the air filter. Other than that I'm not sure what else will need to be done - maybe the wiper blades every once in a while but even on my Honda Fit I only had to replace those a couple times.

This is a beautiful and magnificent car. I'm grateful I have the means to afford it and love what Tesla is doing and their mission. What do you think of my first experience with my Tesla Model 3? Are you considering buying a Tesla?

As part of the Excess Defense Articles (EDA) programme the Pentagon decided to transfer eight former US Marine Corps (USMC) helicopters six Bell AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters and two Bell UH-1Y Venom multipurpose helicopters to the Vzdu≈°n√© s√≠ly arm√°dy ƒåesk√© republiky (CzAF Czech Air Force).

The helicopters will be donated to the CzAF the Czechs will only need to pay for the costs of upgrading and delivering of the helicopters. The US Embassy in the Czech Republic emphasized that this donation is a ‚Äúbonus‚Äù due to the fact that the Czech Republic donated two Mi-24V attack Helicopters to Ukraine.

According to a publication in The Wall Street Journal dated May 2022 Czechia has seven Mi-24 and ten Mi-35s attack helicopters ready for transfer to Ukraine under one important condition the delivery of the newly ordered UH-1Y and AH-1Z helicopters needed to be accelerated.

In September 2020 the CzAF ordered four AH-1Z Vipers and eight UH-1Y Venoms. In July 2021 the Bell Textron Inc. Amarillo Assembly Center (TX) started the production of the first UH-1Y followed by the production of the first AH-1Z in February 2022. All work is expected to be completed by November 2023.

It has not been reported when the additional ex USMC helicopters will be delivered but in the end the CzAF will have a fleet of ten AH-1Z Vipers and ten UH-1Y Venoms.

All animal work was done in accordance with Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval. Mice were fed a standard rodent chow diet and water ad libitum and housed with a standard 12-hour light/dark cycle. 5XFAD mice on a C57BL6 background (Jackson Laboratories) were maintained by crossing transgene positive hemizygous male C57BL6 mice with transgene negative female C57BL6 mice (Jackson Laboratories). In our chronic treatment protocol drug treatments were initiated at 2 months old the age at which plaque deposition is beginning [36 37]. In the acute treatment protocol drug treatment was initiated at 5 months of age after which plaque deposition and axonal degeneration is widespread [38 39].

LNK-754 was synthesized by Link Medicine (Massachusetts USA) and lonafarnib was obtained from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Harbor MI). For animal treatments LNK-745 and lonafarnib were prepared in a heated solution of 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) as a vehicle at a concentration of 0.10 mg/mL until dissolved and the solution was clear. Aliquots for injection were frozen at ‚àí 20 ¬∞C and then thawed and stored at 4 ¬∞C for each week of treatment. Mice were treated following an established protocol known to enhance lysosome activity [8]. In the chronic treatment protocol 2-month-old 5XFAD mice were injected by intraperitoneal (i.p) injection with either vehicle LNK-754 or lonafarnib daily using a 29-guage insulin syringe for a 12-week period until mice were 5 months old. In the acute treatment regimen 5-month-old 5XFAD mice were i.p injected daily for a 3-week period. Upon completion of treatments mice were anesthetized perfused and brains were collected for further analyses (see below sections). For cell culture experiments LNK-754 and lonafarnib were dissolved in DMSO and added to mouse primary neuron cultures at a concentration of 10 nM for a 48-hour period. The vehicle treatment was an equivalent amount of DMSO. Cells were collected and analyzed as described below.

Antibodies

The antibodies used for immunofluorescence experiments were rat anti-LAMP1 (#1D4B DSHB) rabbit anti-AŒ≤42 (#700254 Invitrogen) rabbit anti-BACE1 (#ab108394 Abcam) rabbit anti-Œ≤III tubulin (#ab18207 Abcam). For immunoblotting the antibodies used were rabbit anti-actin (#926‚Äì42210 LI-COR) rabbit anti-p44/42 MAPK (pErk1/2) (#CS9101 Cell Signaling Technology) rabbit anti-44/42 (Erk1/2) (#CS137F5 Cell Signaling Technology) rabbit anti-LAMP1 (#CS3234 Cell Signaling Technology) mouse anti-BACE (3D5; Zhao et al. 2007) mouse anti-APP (6E10) (#803001 BioLegend) rabbit anti-p-tau (ser404) (#CS20194 Cell Signaling Technology) mouse anti-Tau1 (#MAB3420 Millipore Sigma) prelamin-A (#MABPT858 Millipore Sigma) and mouse anti-HDJ-2 (#sc-59554 Santa Cruz). Anti-rabbit or -mouse secondary antibodies from Vector Laboratories were used for immunoblots.

Behavioral testing

Animals and drug treatment

Behavioral analyses were performed by reMYND Inc. using the hAPP/PS1 mouse model with neuron-specific expression of a clinical mutant of the human amyloid precursor protein together with a clinical mutant of human presenilin 1 [40]. This double transgenic mouse displays spontaneous progressive accumulation of AŒ≤ in the brain eventually resulting in amyloid plaques within subiculum hippocampus and cortex at 6 months of age. 48 female hAPP/PS1 mice in FVB x C57Bl/6 J background of 6 months of age were used for this study in combination with 12 age-matched female wild type controls in FVB x C57Bl/6 J background. Administration of 0.9 mg/kg/day of LNK-754 was performed per oral gavage once a day during 12 consecutive days. The sacrifice of the animals was performed 2 hours after final dosing.

All mice were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the age of 3 weeks and received a unique identity number once the PCR results were known. All mice were double checked by a second PCR before the onset of the study. All mice were blind randomized and age-matched. Mice were given a random number by computer and allocated randomly to a treatment. The animals were re-caged by treatment group 15 days before the onset of the study to allow them to familiarize to the new cage context. Mice had free access to pre-filtered and sterile water and standard mouse chow (Sniff¬Æ Ms-H Sniff Spezialdi√§ten GmbH Soest Germany). The food was stored under dry and cool conditions in a well-ventilated storage room. The amount of water and food was checked daily supplied when necessary and standard refreshed once a week. Mice were initially housed under a reversed day-night rhythm (14 hours light/10 hours darkness) starting at 7 p.m. in standard metal cages type RVS T2 (area of 540 cm2). The cages are equipped with solid floors and layer of bedding litter. The number of mice per cage was limited in accordance with local legislation on animal welfare. 15 days before the start of treatment mice were re-caged in individual ventilated macrolon T2 cages and transported to the laboratory for acclimation to the laboratory environment in preparation for treatment. In the laboratory the day-night rhythm was changed to 12 hours light/ 12 hours darkness starting at 7 p.m.

Morris water maze

The Morris Water Maze was performed on days 8‚Äì12 of treatment and the animals were sacrificed directly after the probe test. The pool (a white circular vessel 1 m in diameter) contained water at 20 ¬∞C with titanium-dioxide as an odorless nontoxic additive to hide the escape platform (1 cm beneath the water level). Swimming of each mouse was videotaped and analyzed (Ethovision Noldus information Technology Wageningen the Netherlands). Prior to training each mouse was placed on top of the platform for 15 seconds. For place navigation tests mice were trained to locate the hidden platform in seven blocks of three trials over four consecutive days. Each trial consists of a forced swim test of maximum 120 seconds followed by 10 minutes of rest. The time each mouse needed to locate the platform was measured. The seven consecutive blocks result in a learning curve. 24 hours after the last training each animal had a probe trial with the platform removed. Mice were allowed to search for 60 seconds and quadrant search time and crossings of the original platform position was measured. During the final probe test mice were allowed to search the previous location of the platform during 60 seconds after the platform was removed.

Primary neuron culture

Forebrains were dissected in Hanks‚Äô Balanced Salt solution (HBSS) (Thermo Fisher #14185‚Äì052) from pregnant wild-type C57BL6 mice (Jackson) on E15.5 to obtain primary neurons. Dissected forebrains were digested in 2.5% trypsin at 37 ¬∞C for 20 minutes. A fire-polished Pasteur pipette was used to dissociate the neurons in HBSS. The neurons were then plated on a poly-L-lysine-coated six-well plate 2 √ó 106 neurons per well in neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B-27 500 ŒºM glutamine 10% horse serum and 2.5 ŒºM glutamate (all from Thermo Fisher). The media was changed 2 hours later to Neurobasal with 2% B-27 500 ŒºM glutamine and 2.5 ŒºM glutamate. 24 hours later the media was changed to Neurobasal plus 2% B-27 and 500 ŒºM glutamine. Half media changes were made every 2‚Äì3 days. Primary neurons were cultured for 7 days and treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 10 nM concentrations of LNK-754 or lonafarnib for 48 hours. Neurons were then fixed or live imaged as described below. For fixation neurons were incubated for 20 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde 0.12 M sucrose in 1XPBS permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated with primary antibodies overnight followed by donkey anti-mouse Alexafluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes 1:1000) and co-stained with 300 nM DAPI. Coverslips were mounted using Prolong Gold (Molecular Probes) and images acquired on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a 60X objective (NA 1.4) and NIS Elements software.

Live imaging of neurons

For live-imaging experiments neurons were prepared as above and plated in 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek # P35G-1.5-14C) for 7 days in culture. 10 nM LNK-754 or lonafarnib were then added to conditioned media control cultures were treated with DMSO as a vehicle. After 48 hours of treatment media was replaced with conditioned media from untreated parallel plates of neurons. 25 nM of LysoTracker-Green DND-26 (#L7526 Invitrogen) was added to the conditioned media and neurons were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 ¬∞C. Time-lapse imaging of neurons was performed using a Ti2 widefield microscope. Imaging began immediately at 30 minutes and continued for no longer than 30 minutes. 1-s exposures were taken every minute and 20‚Äì30 separate areas per dish were imaged within 30 mins. The distance and velocity quantifications of LysoTracker particles and kymograph analyses were performed using NIS Elements software and described in detail below. In separate experiments 1 ŒºM Lysosensor-Green DND-189 (#L7535 Invitrogen) was added to conditioned media and captured images of live neurons were taken for no longer than 15 minutes using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a 60X objective (NA 1.4) and NIS Elements software.

Live imaging of brain tissues

5-month-old 5XFAD mice were i.p injected daily for a 3-week period and upon treatment completion mice were anesthetized and perfused with a solution containing 1 M KCl 1 M MgCl 2  0.1 mM kynurenate 0.01 mM DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid 5 mM glutathione 25 mM glucose 125 mM NaCl 1.4 mM NaH 2 PO 4 and 25 mM NaHCO 3 . Brains were then rapidly dissected in ice-cold oxygenated ACSF containing 2.5 mM KCl 85 mM NaCl 1.25 mM NaH 2 PO 4  25 mM NaHCO 3  0.5 mM CaCl 2  4 mM 4 MgCl 2  75 mM sucrose 25 mM glucose 50uM C 6 H 7 NaO 6  0.1 mM kynurenate 0.01 mM DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid and 5 mM glutathione. 300 Œºm coronal slices were obtained using a Compresstome VF-200 vibrating microtome (Precisionary Instruments) and allowed to rest for 30 minutes for recovery at 32 ¬∞C in oxygenated ACSF solution containing the following 2.5 mM KCl 85 mM NaCl 1.25 mM NaH 2 PO 4  25 mM NaHCO 3  0.5 mM CaCl 2  4 mM 4 MgCl 2  75 mM sucrose 25 mM glucose 50uM C 6 H 7 NaO 6  0.1 mM kynurenate 0.01 mM DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid and 5 mM glutathione. The slices were then transferred to 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek # P35G-1.5-14C) containing oxygenated ACSF with 25 nM LysoTracker-Green and a 1:10000 dilution of 1 mg/mL Thiazine Red (#S570435 Sigma Aldrich) that was otherwise identical to the ACSF used during the recovery period. Slice viability was confirmed using time-lapse imaging of tissues. Slices were incubated with LysoTracker-Green and Thiazine Red for 15 minutes at room temperature and then cortical brain regions were imaged immediately in the same solution at 32 ¬∞C on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a 60X objective (NA 1.4) and NIS Elements software for no longer than 30 minutes.

Brain extraction and immunoblotting

Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of xylazine (15 mg/kg) and ketamine (100 mg/kg) perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (1XPBS) with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (20 Œºg/ml) leupeptin (0.5 Œºg/ml) sodium orthovanadate (20 ŒºM) and dithiothreitol (0.1 mM) followed by brain removal. All buffers used for protein extraction contained protease inhibitor cocktail III (#535140 Millipore) and Halt phosphatase inhibitor (#78420 Thermo Fisher Scientific). Hemibrain tissues were weighed and manually homogenized using a dounce homogenizer 1:10 (w/v) in 1XPBS. After homogenization lysates were centrifuged at 20800 g for 30 minutes at 4 ¬∞C. The soluble fraction (supernatant) was removed and the pellet was resuspended by pipetting in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer [50 mM tris 0.15 M NaCl 1% octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (IGEPAL) 1 mM EDTA 1 mM EGTA 0.1% SDS and 0.5% sodium deoxylate at pH 8] to incubate on ice for 30 minutes. The samples were sonicated (Misonix XL-2000) for 20 seconds on ice and then centrifuged at 20800 g for 30 minutes at 4 ¬∞C. The RIPA-soluble fraction (supernatant) was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 5 M guanidine (pH 8.0) for analysis of insoluble proteins. Each sample was sonicated for 20 seconds on ice rotated for 1 hour at room temperature and then centrifuged at 20800 g for 30 minutes at 4 ¬∞C. The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (#23225 Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to measure the protein concentration of each sample.

For western blots 20 Œºg of protein of each sample was loaded onto 4‚Äì12% NuPAGE (Invitrogen) gels and separated using MOPS buffer under reduced and denatured conditions. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and developed using Pierce ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The developed signals were visualized using ProteinSimple FCR (FluorChem R) and the subsequent chemiluminescent signals were quantified using AlphaView software (ProteinSimple). All blots were analyzed using the Local Background Correction tool except for the HDJ-2 blot which was analyzed using the Background Link tool in conjunction with Multi-regional Background Correction (AlphaView software).

AŒ≤42 ELISA

To measure AŒ≤42 in hemibrain homogenates from 5XFAD mice a commercially available Enzyme- Linked-Immunosorbent-Assay (ELISA) (Thermo Fisher Scientific KHB3441) was used following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions to analyze guanidine and PBS-soluble AŒ≤42 in hemibrains. To measure AŒ≤42 in brains of hAPP/PS1 mice a commercially available ELISA was used (h amyloid Œ≤42 ELISA high sensitive The Genetics Company Zurich Switzerland). The ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol.

Mouse brain tissue immunofluorescence

After perfusion brains were extracted and hemibrains were fixed in 10% formalin followed by cryopreservation in 30% sucrose solution in 1XPBS. A freezing-sliding microtome was used to harvest 30-Œºm coronal or sagittal sections. Sections were serially placed in a 12-well plate in a cryoprotective solution (1xPBS 30% sucrose and 30% ethylene glycol) and stored at ‚àí 20 ¬∞C until use. Immunofluorescence staining was performed by first washing sections three times in 1XTBS and then incubating sections in 16 mM glycine in 1XTBS for 1 hour at room temperature. After 3 additional washes in 1XTBS sections were blocked in 5% goat serum in 0.25% Triton X-100 in 1XTBS for 2 hours at room temperature. The sections were then incubated overnight in primary antibodies in a solution of 0.25% Triton X-100 1% bovine serum albumin and 1XTBS at 4 ¬∞C. Secondary immunostaining was then performed with donkey AlexaFluor‚Äìlabeled secondary antibodies at a concentration of 1:1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). ProLong Gold (#P36934 Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to mount sections before being imaged on a Ti2 wide-field microscope or a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope for image quantification using Nikon NIS Elements software for acquisition. All acquisition settings remained the same between genotypes and all images were acquired within same imaging period for individual experiments (Northwestern University Center for Advanced Microscopy and Nikon Imaging Centre).

Image quantification

Mouse brains

Immunofluorescence quantification of mouse brain tissue immunostaining was performed on 3‚Äì5 sections per animal from Bregma coordinates of approximately ‚àí 0.94 to ‚àí 2.55 mm which were imaged using a 10X objective on a Ti2 wide-field microscope. Quantification analyses including size and intensity thresholds were performed using Nikon NIS-Elements Software (Northwestern University Nikon Imaging Center). Depending on the signal thresholds were set using the General Analysis tool based on object size shape and contrast and then binary masks were created for each channel and region of interest. Thresholding was performed separately on each channel to isolate signals of interest by optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio and eliminating non-specific background signal. For the calculation of LAMP1 BACE1 or LysoTracker-Green covered area as well as LAMP1 and Lysosensor fluorescence intensity measurements in primary neurons regions of interest were manually traced using NIS-Elements and a binary layer was created for each region of interest. To calculate the ratio of LAMP1 to AŒ≤42 the area of LAMP1 in dystrophic neurites was normalized to the area of AŒ≤42 on an individual plaque basis and the average ratios per mouse between treatment groups were quantified. Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient analysis for BACE1 and LAMP1 was performed using NIS-Elements on a per plaque basis on maximum intensity projections of 30 Œºm Z-stack images taken using a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 1 Œºm step size. To calculate the ratio of LysoTracker-Green to Thiazine red the area of LysoTracker-Green in dystrophic neurites was normalized to the area of Thiazine Red on an individual plaque basis and the average ratio per mouse was quantified between treatment groups. Four coronal sections from Bregma coordinates of approximately ‚àí 1.70 to ‚àí 2.55 mm were used to calculate the area or intensity of each signal in each respective brain region for each mouse. Analysis of plaque covered area and plaque size was performed using the average of five sections per mouse from Bregma coordinates of approximately ‚àí 0.94 to ‚àí 2.55 mm. Section selection image acquisition image tracing and quantifications were performed by a person blinded to treatment groups and genotypes.

Primary neurons

For the quantifications of LAMP1 immunostaining in fixed mouse primary neurons somas were manually traced based on morphology using NIS-Elements and a binary mask was created for each region of interest and channel. Thresholding was used to optimize LAMP1 signals and distinguish LAMP1 in neurites including both dendrites and axons by isolating pixels of LAMP1 positive for tubulin pixels. The cell soma LAMP1 signals were excluded from total LAMP1 area to analyze LAMP1 vesicles in neurites. For analysis of LysoTracker-Green motility in neurons images were quantified using NIS-Elements. The speed and distance of total LysoTracker-Green particles in each frame were tracked using the automated motion tracking feature in NIS-Elements. A threshold was set and applied to all movies based on size and fluorescence intensity of LysoTracker-Green particles to eliminate background noise. For kymograph generation time-lapse imaging of single neurons was performed on a 60X confocal microscope and axons were identified morphologically. The percentage of frequency of particles moving in an anterograde or retrograde direction or stationary was quantified by dividing the number of particles for each group by the total number of particles. For kymograph analyses moving particles were defined as having speed above 0.1 ŒºM/sec.

Statistical analysis

GraphPad Prism software v8 was used to perform statistical analyses including analysis of variance (ANOVA) with posthoc tests when comparing more than two samples and unpaired t test when only two samples were being compared. Specific test details including number of replicates type of posthoc tests and P values are stated in figure legends. All quantifications are plotted at the mean ¬± SEM. Significance was concluded when the P value was less than 0.05 indicated by *P < 0.05 **P < 0.01 ***P < 0.001 ****P < 0.0001.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQyMDAzLTAyMi0wMzc4MS0z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plant hairy roots for the production of extracellular vesicles with antitumor bioactivity | Communications Biology,"Plant material and growth conditions

Salvia dominica seeds were kindly provided by Ammar Bader (Department of Pharmacognosy Umm Al-Qura University Saudi Arabia). The seeds were surface sterilized with 70% (v/v) ethanol for 1 min and then with 2% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite solution for 10 min rinsed five times with sterile distilled water for 1 min each and then sown under aseptic conditions in autoclaved Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium (pH 5.8) containing 30 g/L sucrose and 9 g/L agar. The plants were grown in vitro at 23 ¬∞C under a photoperiod of 8 hour dark and 16 hour light in a controlled growth chamber with a photosynthetically active radiation of 110 Œºmol m‚Äì2 s‚Äì1 at the leaf level.

Hairy root cultures production and characterization

The protocol to obtain hairy roots of Salvia dominica was adapted from our previous work26. Briefly the Agrobacterium rhizogenes virulent strain ATCC 15834 obtained from a single colony was grown (OD 600 = 0.3‚Äì0.5) in Yeast Extract Broth (YEB) liquid medium (0.1% Yeast extract 0.5% Beef extract 0.5% Peptone 0.5% Sucrose 0.04% MgSO 4 ) at 26 ¬∞C. Before transformation bacteria were collected from liquid cultures at 5000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended at a cell density OD 600 = 0.5 in YEB and were shaken for 1 h in the rotary shaker before inoculation. S. dominica sterile leaf explants from 20 day-old plants aseptically grown in vitro were submerged in the bacterial suspension for 30 min. Then leaf explants were taken and dried under laminar flow hood for 15 minutes and co-cultivated at 26 ¬∞C for 3 days in MS30 solid medium and then transferred to fresh MS medium containing cefotaxime (CX 100 mg/L) and kept in petri dish in the dark at 23 ¬∞C. After three weeks of several subcultures of infected leaves in media containing decreasing concentrations of CX (from 100 mg/L to 50 mg/L) hairy roots developing from the infected sites were individually excised sub-cultured weekly in solid MS medium and kept for additional two weeks in the dark at 23 ¬∞C. Subsequently hairy roots were transferred in hormone free liquid MS medium and maintained in aseptic condition (MS medium CX 50 mg/L) at 26 ¬∞C in the dark in a shaking incubator (140 rpm). To confirm that the differentiated roots were HRs (and not adventitious roots) and that A. rhizogenes was efficiently eradicated PCR analysis was carried out in order to check the presence of rolB and the absence of virD2 genes respectively. DNA purification of three independent hairy root lines and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) were carried out by using Thermo Scientific Phire Plant Direct PCR Kit and the gene-specific primers: Actin (HM231319 forward primer: 5‚Ä≤-GGTGCCCTGAGGTCCTGTT-3‚Ä≤; reverse primer: 5‚Ä≤-GAGCCACCACTGAGGACAAT-3‚Ä≤; amplicon length: 142 bp); rolB (GenBank:X03433.1; forward primer: 5‚Ä≤- GATTCAACCATATCGGAGCG -3‚Ä≤; reverse primer: 5‚Ä≤- TGAGCATGTGCTGTTTTTGG -3‚Ä≤; amplicon length: 590 bp); rolC (MT514512.1; forward primer: 5‚Ä≤-CGACCTGTGTTCTCTTTTTCAAGC-3‚Ä≤; primer reverse: 5‚Ä≤-GCACTCGCCATGCCTCACCAACTCACC-3‚Ä≤; amplicon length: 514 bp); VirD2 (forward primer: 5‚Ä≤-ATGCCCGATCGAGCTCAAGT; reverse primer: 5‚Ä≤-CCTGACCCAAACATCTCGGCT-3‚Ä≤; amplicon length: 317 bp).

PCR was performed using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 98 ¬∞C for 5‚Ä≤ followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 98 ¬∞C for 15‚Äù annealing at 55 ¬∞C for 15‚Äù and extension at 72 ¬∞C for 45‚Äù and final extension at 72 ¬∞C for 5‚Ä≤. Then PCR amplified products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel.

Isolation of extracellular vesicles

Extracellular vesicles were isolated from the conditioned culture medium of S. dominica hairy roots (approximately 40 mL of medium for 2 grams of hairy roots) using differential centrifugation method. Overall the medium was collected after 10 days of subculturing and used fresh for EV isolation. Alternatively the conditioned media were stored in 50 mL tubes at ‚Äì80 ¬∞C up to one month.

Briefly the medium was initially centrifuged at 300 √ó g for 10 minutes and then at 2000 √ó g for 20 minutes to remove living or dead cells and cell debris. Afterwards the supernatants were filtered using 0.45 ¬µm pore size membrane filters (Merck Millipore) to remove contaminating apoptotic bodies very small cell debris and organelles.

Additional low velocity centrifugation was performed using 50 mL Beckman polypropylene tubes with the Beckman Type 55.2 Ti fixed angle rotor (k-factor: 64) at 15000 √ó g for 20 minutes at room temperature. Clarified conditioned medium was then centrifuged to pellet extracellular vesicles using thick wall polycarbonate tubes (Beckman Coulter No. 355631) in a Beckman Coulter Optima‚Ñ¢ L-90K ultracentrifuge at 100000 √ó g avg at 4 ¬∞C for 3 hours with a Type 55.2 Ti rotor. The pellet was solubilised in 30 Œºl of MilliQ water and transferred in 1.5 mL tubes. After the isolation EV were used fresh for subsequent analyses or stored at ‚Äì80 ¬∞C avoiding freeze-thaw cycles.

EV protein profiling by SDS-PAGE

The quality of the vesicle samples and the reproducibility of EV isolation were controlled using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). First ten microliters of each samples (corresponding approximatively to 1.9e + 07 EVs) were electrophoretically separated under reducing conditions on polyacrylamide gel and then silver-stained as described by Shevchenko et al.67 with small modifications. Silver staining has been conducted in all the EV preparations.

Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)

Size distribution of extracellular nanovesicles was measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Ver. 7.01 Malvern Instrument (Malvern UK). Ten microliters of EV preparation were dispersed in deionized MilliQ water and the intensity of the scattered light was measured with a detector at 90¬∞ angle at room temperature. To prove the EV sensitivity to detergents HR-derived EVs were incubated with 1% SDS and kept at room temperature for 1 h. Then the samples were analysed by DLS as above mentioned. Measurements were carried out in three different EV preparations.

Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)

The size distribution and concentration of HR-derived EVs were analysed by NTA using a NanoSight model NS300 equipped with a Blue405laser and a sCMOS camera (Malvern Instruments Malvern UK). The samples (15 Œºl) were diluted in 0.5 ml PBS and mixed well and the diluted samples were then injected into the laser chamber. The following settings were used for data acquisition: camera level 9 acquisition time 30 s and detection threshold 2. For each measurement three videos were captured under the following conditions: cell temperature: 24 ¬∞C; Syringe speed: 50 ¬µl/s. After capture the videos have been analysed by the NanoSight Software NTA 3.4 with a detection threshold of 2. Three independent experiments were carried out.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)

Before using a grid of carbon film supported on 300 mesh copper grid a glow discharge was performed on it (30 s 15 mA). The samples were fixed using glutaraldehyde 2.5% in PBS and deposited on a parafilm. The grid was placed on the drop for 5 min washed with distilled water for 1 min and placed for 1 min in a drop of 3 microliters of 2% staining agent (Methylamine Vanadate NanoVan) and diluted in H 2 O before washing it with water for 1 min. TEM images were collected using a FEI Tecnai T20 (FEI Europe Eindhoven Netherlands) in the Laboratorio de Microscopias Avanzadas at Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain). TEM observations have been carried out in three independent EV preparations.

Proteomic and Bioinformatic analyses

Protein extracts from purified HR-derived EVs and from pellet fractions collected at low-speed centrifugation were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Resulting gels were divided into 10 pieces and each underwent a trypsin in gel digestion procedure. The obtained peptide mixtures were analysed on a Orbitrap Q-Exactive Classic Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with a nanoUltimate300 UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptide separation was performed on a capillary EASY-Spray PepMap column (0.075 mm √ó 50 mm 2 ¬µm Thermo Fisher Scientific) using aqueous 0.1% formic acid (A) and CH3CN containing 0.1% formic acid (B) as mobile phases and a linear gradient from 3 to 40% of B in 45 minutes and a 300 nL¬∑min‚àí1 flow rate. Mass spectra were acquired over an m/z range from 375 to 1500. To achieve sequence confirmation MS and MS/MS data underwent Mascot software (v2.5 Matrix Science) analysis using the non- redundant Data Bank UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot (Release 2021_03) limited to green plants proteins (Viridiplantae). Parameter sets were: trypsin cleavage; carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation as a variable modification; a maximum of two missed cleavages; false discovery rate (FDR) calculated by searching the decoy database 0.05. Proteomic analyses were performed in duplicate on three different vesicle preparations and only the proteins commonly identified in all the experiments were considered. Gene ontology analysis of identified proteins was carried out using the specific tool in UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB; http://www.uniprot.org).

Human cell culture

MIA PaCa-2 (CRL-1420‚Ñ¢) are immortalized epithelial cells of human pancreatic carcinoma. They were purchased from ATCC (Manassas VA USA) and cultured as reported68. HaCaT cells are human immortalized keratinocytes. They were purchased from CLS Cell Lines Service GmbH (Germany) and maintained in Dulbecco‚Äôs modified Eagle‚Äôs medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MCF-7 (HTB-22‚Ñ¢) are human breast cancer cells and were purchased from ATCC (Manassas VA USA). Both cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco‚Äôs modified Eagle‚Äôs medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

All the media were supplemented with antibiotics (10000 U/ml penicillin and 10 mg/ml streptomycin) cells were stained at 37 ¬∞C in 5% CO 2 ‚àí95% air humidified atmosphere and were serially passed at 70‚Äì80% confluence.

MTT assay

HaCaT MIA PaCa-2 and MCF-7 cells were seeded in 15 √ó 103 cells/well in triplicate in 96 well-plates and incubated for 24 and 48 h with freshly prepared S. dominica EVs at a three different concentrations namely 6 √ó 107 1.2 √ó 108 and 3 √ó 108 particles/mL. Cells treated with heat-inactivated EVs were used as negative controls. To this aim EV preparations were kept at 95 ¬∞C for 1 h cooled down at room temperature for 2 h and then administered to the cell cultures.

As reported in Bizzarro et al.69 at the ends of the selected experimental times 3-(45-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-25-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) stock solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well (25 Œºl per 100 Œºl medium) and plates were incubated at 37 ¬∞C for 3 h. Cells were then lysed and the dark blue formazan crystals dissolved with 100 Œºl of a solution containing 50% (v/v) N N-dimethylformamide 20% (w/v) SDS with an adjusted pH of 4.5. The optical density (OD) of each well was measured in a microplate spectrophotometer (Titertek Multiskan MCC/340) equipped with a 620 nm filter. The viability of cells in response to the treatments with gemcitabine HR-derived EVs and heat-denatured EVs was calculated as: % viable cells = [OD (550 nm‚Äì690 nm) treatments/OD (550 nm‚Äì690 nm) negative control] √ó 100. Values were presented as means ¬± SD of three independent experiments carried out in triplicate.

Cell uptake and confocal microscopy

EVs were labelled with BODIPY¬Æ FL N-(2-aminoethyl)maleimide. Briefly 10 ŒºL of Bodipy dye was added to 13.5 mL of S. dominica HR conditioned medium and mixed for 30 sec. After 5 min incubation at room temperature EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation as described before. After 24 and 48 h EV treatment MIA PaCa-2 cells were harvested and used for confocal analysis performed as reported in a previous work70. Briefly cells were fixed in p-formaldehyde (4% v/v in PBS; Lonza; Basel Switzerland) were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.4% v/v in PBS; Lonza; Basel Switzerland) blocked with goat serum (20% v/v in PBS; Lonza; Basel Switzerland) and then incubated with anti-annexin A1 antibody (rabbit polyclonal; 1:100; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham MA USA) overnight at 4 ¬∞C. After two washing steps cells were incubated with anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 555 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham MA USA) for 2 h at RT in the dark. To detect the nuclei 4‚Ä≤6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI 1:1000) was used. Samples were vertically scanned from the bottom of the coverslip with a total depth of 5 Œºm and a 63X (1.40 NA) Plan-Apochromat oil-immersion objective. Images and scale bars were generated with Zeiss ZEN Confocal Software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH) and presented as single stack. Confocal microscopy analyses were carried out in three independent experiments.

Apoptosis analysis by Flow Cytometry

The percentage of hypodiploid nuclei was estimated by propidium iodide (PI) incorporation into permeabilized cells as described by Belvedere et al68. Briefly cancer cells were harvested after treatment with S. dominica EVs and incubated with a PI solution (0.1% sodium citrate 0.1% Triton X-100) and 50 g/ mL of PI (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO USA) for 30 min at room temperature. Data from 10000 events for each sample were collected by a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Franklin Lakes NJ USA) using Cell Quest evaluation program. FACS analyses were conducted in technical triplicate at least in three independent biological experiments.

Western blot analysis

Cells were lysed in a RIPA buffer containing 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 NaCl 150 mM and Triton 1% supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktails (Sigma Aldrich) and the protein content was measured by a colorimetric assay (BIO-RAD) as described in71. Protein cell lysates (20 Œºg) were separated by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter (BIO-RAD) blocked with 5% milk and probed with primary antibodies: mouse anti-PARP1 (1:500) rabbit anti-procaspase-3 (1:500) and mouse anti-Œ≤actin (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After primary antibody incubation the blots were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The proteins recognized by Abs were detected by ECL (Amersham biosciences) and exposed to Las4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and the relative band intensities were determined using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Pre-stained protein markers (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used as molecular size standards. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Statistics and reproducibility

Sample size and number of replicates for each experiment were described in figure legends where possible. Otherwise these data were properly reported throughout the materials and methods section. Error bars in the graphical data represent standard deviations. A Student‚Äôs t‚Äêtest was used for statistical analysis and P‚Äêvalues ‚â§0.05 (*) ‚â§0.01 (**) and ‚â§0.001 (***) were considered to be statistically significant.

Housing conditions and manipulation of hens employed in the maintenance of the insect colony followed the protocol authorized by the Animal Care Committee of the Centro de Investigaciones en Bioqu√≠mica Cl√≠nica e Inmunolog√≠a (CIBICI-CONICET-Universidad Nacional de C√≥rdoba). They followed the guidelines published by the Canadian Council on Animal Care with the assurance number A5802-01 delivered by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (National Institutes of Health). The animal facility at the CIBICI-CONICET is a dependency of the Argentine National Ministry of Science Science (http://www.bioterios.mincyt.gob.ar). No infected insect species human blood or hen sacrifices were involved in the study. Details of the approved protocol were previously published17.

Insects

Anautogenous females were taken from a colony of D. maxima maintained at 28 ¬∞C 70% relative humidity 8:16 h light/dark photoperiod. Standardized conditions of insect rearing were previously described15. Briefly females were separated from males at the last nymphal stage before blood feeding. Newly emerged females were segregated individually and placed in jars together with two fed males. Successful mating was confirmed by observation of the spermatophore. Mated females were kept in individual jars until they were able to take a blood meal (days 10‚Äì12 post-ecdysis) which resulted in a 3.0‚Äì5.5-fold increase in the body weight of the insect. Thereafter egg laying was daily monitored and the beginning and the end of the oviposition period were recorded. Unless otherwise stated experiments were performed by sampling hemolymph and tissues at representative days of the reproductive cycle as previously descibed1517: pre-vitellogenesis (days 4‚Äì6 post-ecdysis unfed period); vitellogenesis (days 2 3 4 6 and 12 post-blood feeding); and post-vitellogenesis (days 12‚Äì14 after the end of oviposition).

Hemolymph and tissues sampling

Hemolymph was individually collected from immobilized females with a Hamilton syringe by cutting off the legs at the level of the coxa and gently pressing the abdomen. The collected samples were placed in cold tubes containing 10 mM Na 2 EDTA 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (P8340 Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO USA) as previously described 1719. Hemolymph samples were centrifuged at 10000 √ó g for 10 min at 4 ‚ÑÉ to remove hemocytes. Protein amounts were measured using the Bradford method40. Samples were stored at ‚àí 70 ¬∞C until use. Ovarian tissues and fat bodies from females at representative days of the reproductive cycle were dissected out in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 6.6 mM Na 2 HPO 4 /KH 2 PO 4  150 mM NaCl pH 7.4) using a standard stereoscope as previously described 1719.

Cloning the full-length cDNA of DmaxMet

The complete sequences of the DmaxMet transcripts were obtained by Rapid Amplification cDNA End (RACE) (SMARTer RACE 5‚Ä≤/3‚Ä≤ kit Takara Bio USA Inc). Briefly for the first cDNA synthesis step a universal mixture of primers was used to recognize specific regions of the 3‚Ä≤ or 5‚Ä≤ ends (3‚Ä≤ RACE-cDNA or 5‚Ä≤ RACE-cDNA respectively). Synthesis of RACE-cDNAs was performed using 1 Œºg of ovarian total RNA. For the RACE amplification reaction DmaxMet gene-specific primers were: a forward primer for 3‚Ä≤ RACE-cDNA and a reverse primer for 5‚Ä≤ RACE-cDNA. To achieve optimal yields the DmaxMet primers were designed with a length of 23‚Äì28 nucleotides (nt) containing a guanidine/cytosine (GC) ratio of 50‚Äì70% and a melting temperature (Tm) > 70%. Additionally a 15 nt sequence (GATTACGCCAAGCTT) necessary for the insertion of the gene of interest into the p-RACE vector was added to the primers. Once the amplification reaction was completed the size of the RACE product was verified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. For optimal quality in the sequencing the fragments obtained by RACE were cloned on the p-RACE vector following the manufacturers' recommendations. The clones obtained were then sequenced using a 3130XL Genetic Analysers in the DNA core facility at FIU (Miami FL USA).

Bioinformatic analyses and modelling

The deduced amino acid sequence molecular mass and isoelectric point prediction for the two DmaxMet isoforms were assessed using tools available on Expasy (http://web.www.expasy.org; SIB Bioinformatics Resource Portal). The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool algorithm (BLAST https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) was employed to compare the sequence of the transcripts coding for DmaxMet isoforms with other Met sequences deposited in databases. BLAST was also used to predict the major functional domains of the receptor. Mapping of exons in DmaxMet was achieved with the Exon‚ÄìIntron Graphic Maker (http://wormweb.org/exonintron) taking as references the homologous sequences reported for R. prolixus21.

The molecular model of DmaxMet was built by homology modelling using I-TASSER package22. The HIF2Œ±‚ÄìArnt crystal structure (PDB ID 3F1P) was chosen as an homologous template7. The visualization of the structures was performed by UCSF Chimera41 and PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System Version 2.0 Schr√∂dinger LLC).

The obtained DmaxMet three-dimensional model was used in docking simulation to analyze the interaction between DmaxMet and JHSB 3  only the DmaxMet PAS domain were considered since they are the only domains with crystallized templates deposited in databases. The docking calculations were carried out with DockThor version 24243.

For the evolutionary analysis of Met the predicted amino acid sequences for DmaxMet were compared with selected Met sequences retrieved from the NCBI database. The sequences were aligned using MAFFT44 and twenty alternative full-length alignments were combined via GUIDANCE245 and used for inferring the protein phylogeny. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with PhyML46 under Maximum Likelihood model (LG + G + I)474849 using branch support analysis50.

RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR)

Ovaries and fat bodies were subjected to RNA extraction with TRIzol (Thermofisher Waltham MA USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were treated with DNase to remove genomic DNA (Promega Heidelberg Germany) and RNA integrity was evaluated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA synthesis from 2 ¬µg of total RNA was performed using the Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase protocol (M-MLV Promega Heidelberg Germany). The qPCR assays were performed with an ABI Prism 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems Foster City CA USA) using a Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA) as previously described19. The 2‚àíŒîŒîCt method was employed to evaluate of relative changes in gene expression51 using 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) as a reference gene 1952. Unless otherwise stated all reactions were carried out by triplicate. The primer sequences of all genes assayed are displayed on Supplementary Table 1. In the case of DmaxMet the primers were designed to target a region shared by the DmaxMet 1 and DmaxMet 2. In D. maxima vitellogenin (Vg) is the product of the genes Vg1 and Vg2 the latter showing the highest level of expression19. Therefore in the present work Vg2 was the gene quantified and named Vg for simplicity.

The amplification efficiency for each pair of primers was calculated using standard curves generated by serial dilutions of cDNA. All reactions showed an efficiency higher than 96% for the different pair of primers tested.

Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) synthesis and knockdown of DmaxMet gene expression

A 317 base pair Met template was used to synthesize a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule. Gene-specific primers targeting a region shared by the two DmaxMet isoforms were designed and then combined with the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. The synthesis of dsRNAs was carried out using the MEGAScript RNAi kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs recommendations. dsRNAs were precipitated with ammonium acetate/ethanol and then suspended in ultrapure RNase-free water to a final concentration of 5 Œºg/Œºl. A dsRNA molecule based on the ampicillin resistance gene (dsARG) from the pGEM-T Easy Vector system was used as a control as previously described 1953.

To knockdown the expression of DmaxMet adult females at 10‚Äì12 days post-ecdysis were injected into the hemocoel with 10 ¬µg of dsMet or dsARG (control) dissolved in 2 ¬µl of ultrapure water using a Hamilton microsyringe. At 24 h post-injection dsRNA-treated insects were fed with blood and 2 days later fat bodies and ovaries were individually sampled and processed by qPCR to determine the DmaxMet mRNA levels. The effect of DmaxMet silencing on Vg and Lp gene expression in fat bodies as well as on VgR and LpR in ovarian tissue was also assessed by qPCR.

Vitellogenin and lipophorin assessments

To further evaluate the relevance of DmaxMet knockdown on the yolk protein precursors Vg and Lp metabolism a group of females were treated with dsMet or dsARG (control). At 24 h post-injection dsRNA-treated insects were fed with blood and 2 days later hemolymph fat bodies and ovaries were collected. Quantification of Vg and Lp was accomplished by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a polyclonal anti-vitellin antibody (anti-Vt 1:4000) and a polyclonal anti-lipophorin antibody (anti-Lp 1:5000) as previously reported151954. Purified Vt and Lp were employed to build calibration curves1454. For the assays the hemolymph was individually collected and directly processed for ELISA. Fat bodies were weighed and then homogenized in buffer Tris-NaCl (20 mM Tris 150 mM NaCl pH 7.4) containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors. The homogenates were first centrifuged at 2500 √ó g for 10 min at 4 ¬∞C and the floating fat cake and pellet were discarded. The resulting material was centrifuged at 15000 √ó g for 30 min at 4 ¬∞C and the supernatants collected and used for ELISA as previously described19.

Vg and Lp were also evaluated in ovarian tissue by immunofluorescence assays as previously described19. Briefly the ovaries from dsDmaxMet or control females were dissected out and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS transferred to PBS/sucrose and processed for cryostat sectioning54. Thereafter tissue sections (10 ¬µm) were obtained using a Leica CM1510 cryostat (Leica Microsystems Wetzlar Germany) and placed onto poly-L-lysine-treated glass slides (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO USA). For the assays the slides were blocked with 1% BSA 0.1% Triton X-100 5% fetal bovine serum in PBS during 1 h and then incubated sequentially as follow: anti-Vt antibody (1:4000) followed by a secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes Carlsbad CA USA); anti-lipophorin antibody labeled with FITC (anti-Lp-FITC 1:10). Slides were mounted in Fluorsave (Calbiochem Darmstadt Germany) and examined in a Leica DMi8 microscope (Leica Microsystems Wetzlar Germany).

Statistical analysis

The results are presented as the mean ¬± Standard Deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments as stated in the legend to figures. Each experimental point includes ovaries fat body or hemolymph from insects processed individually (n = 3‚Äì4). Graphs and statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 and GraphPad Instat 3.0. (GraphPad Software San Diego CA USA). The data were evaluated for normality and homogeneity of variance using the Shapiro‚ÄìWilk test which showed that no transformations were needed. All datasets passed normality and homoscedasticity tests. Statistical analyses were performed employing Student's t-test or parametric one-way ANOVA and using the Student‚ÄìNewman‚ÄìKeuls multiple-comparisons as a post-test.

''The hurt is coming.''

That's how one farming leader's prediction as the sector is hit by escalating costs that have eroded bottom lines while another says ''we are running to standstill''.

One fertiliser had skyrocketed to $1800 a tonne compared to $799 a tonne two years ago while freight labour feed farm supplies freight regulatory requirements equipment and machinery had all increased.

The dairy industry alongside beef and lamb had posted solid results in the last year with the farmgate forecast sitting at about $9 per kgMS but this was being offset by spiralling costs.

Federated Farmers Bay of Plenty provincial president Darryl Jensen said issues in the supply chain were frustrating and the price of fertiliser was ''horrendous''.

The Pukehina dairy farmer had been waiting two months for a small part for his tractor and products vital for calving were being ordered a season ahead.

The cost of fertiliser had more than doubled Jensen said while petrol was another big expense.

''We are running to standstill and while we have got these good returns we are not a lot better off.''

Te Puke sheep and beef farmer Rick Powdrell said in the past his fertiliser bill accounted for about 20 per cent of his budget and he expected that to increase.

Labour costs had also gone up but he was a firm believer in paying good staff well. Supply chain issues had also hit farmers and there were wait times on fencing gear and posts.

Farmers were resilient Powdrell said but some things had to give.

''You'll often find that it will be maintenance and capital expenditure. Farmers won't replace things they will press on with the old ute tractor or car.''

He acknowledged beef and lamb prices had stabilised although farmers were driven by prices.

''The realistic thing that consumers have got to remember is the more restrictions we put on farming [government regulations] the more productivity goes down and the less we will produce. That drives the world markets and food prices will go up.''

Federated Farmers Rotorua/Taup≈ç provincial president Colin Guyton said the ''hurt is coming for farmers''.

He did not want to get out the ''violin'' as every Kiwi was hit by rising costs but the $9 dairy payout was really only equivalent to the $7 payout seven years ago due to rising costs.

Guyton said farmers had been around long enough to know the payouts could drop ''and will''.

''That is when further cost adjustments are needed so in that period of time farmers will be really really hurting.''

Often farmers were at the backend of a lot of price rises as they were the end consumer.

For example his feed bill had gone up by $130 a tonne which added $30000 to $40000 extra to the budget alongside fertiliser that had more than doubled.

Ballance Agri Nutrients said in a statement to its shareholders that the cost of nutrients had escalated significantly and further escalations were inevitable.

''The war in Ukraine sanctions on Russia/Belarus export bans lockdowns in China and the high cost of energy are all having a significant impact on both the availability and price of nutrients globally. In addition shipping is also significantly disrupted with port congestion due to Covid and the Russian attack resulting in escalated freight rates and disrupted schedules.''

It said in response to the supply challenges Ballance would continue to leverage long-standing international relationships increase order lead times and where possible contract purchase nutrients.

Ballance confirmed a tonne of superphosphate was now about $490 a tonne compared to $315 two years ago while Di-ammonium Phosphate had jumped to $1800 a tonne compared to $799 two years ago.

Beef and Lamb New Zealand chief economist Andrew Burtt said on-farm inflation was 10.2 percent for the year ended March 2022 - the highest it's been since 1985-86 [13.2 percent].

Since that analysis fuel has increased 23 per cent [from March to June] and fertiliser increased by 8 per cent over the same timeframe.

Farmers had also faced increased prices for contractors tradespeople machinery and parts for operating farm infrastructure and vehicles due to a tight labour market and increased import shipping costs he said.

Increased costs place pressure on farmers' ability to meet rising regulation and compliance costs.

''We are concerned increasing regulatory requirements from the Government such as fresh water and biodiversity rules will stretch farmers even further.''

A farmer's income depends on how easily they can sell their livestock he said.

''Meat processors have had labour shortages and backlogs all year which impacts timing for farmers and can impact prices received.

''With farm input costs outstripping gains from good market prices farmers will likely be impacted with lower margins and reduced profitability this season compared to last.

Exports from New Zealand's red meat and wool industry totalled around $11.2 billion for the year ended 30 June 2022 ‚Äì about 17 pe rcent of New Zealand's merchandise goods exports.

Meanwhile pastoral agriculture exports made up 48 per cent of merchandise exports ‚Äì the highest level since 2013-14 .

Dairy NZ chief executive Dr Tim Mackle.

Dairy NZ chief executive Dr Tim Mackle said farmers like all New Zealanders were feeling the effects of increased inflation on daily costs.

''It's challenging for dairy farmers in the current environment and we are seeing them take a range of steps to manage costs.

''Our regional communities and New Zealand continue to benefit from dairy's economic contribution. Dairy is forecast to contribute around $52 billion to New Zealand in 2022/23 [this includes direct and flow-on income to the economy including local communities].''

DairyNZ budget case studies of eight farms across New Zealand showed that over three seasons [2020/21 to 2022/23 forecast] milk income was up $1.19 per kg of milk solids.

''However farm working expense increases up $1.06 per kg of milk solids is eroding most of the milk price gain.''

The largest expense increases between 2020/21 to 2022/23 have been in feed crops re-grassing and grazing ‚Äì up 52 cents per kg of milk solids. Fertiliser expenditure is up 20 cents per kg of milk solids he said.

Overall DairyNZ data indicates average operating expenses for farms including rent interest and loan repayment costs were forecast at $8.66 per kg of milk solids in 2021/22.

''To manage these issues farmers are applying less fertiliser are bulk purchasing supplements or fuel so they are less exposed to future price increases or are planting more crops to reduce reliance on purchased feed or supplements.''",,,,,,,,,,,,

COURTESY ATRIUM HEALTH Atrium Health CEO Gene Woods is The Charlotte Post Foundation‚Äôs 2022 Luminary.

He‚Äôs bringing a medical school to Charlotte has initiated an innovation district where historic Brooklyn was razed and is forming one of the nation‚Äôs largest healthcare organizations.



Eugene Woods Atrium Health‚Äôs president and CEO is known for motivational leadership and a focus on eliminating health disparities and promoting upward mobility. The Charlotte Post Foundation‚Äôs 2022 Luminary award recipient will be honored Oct. 8 at the 25th annual Post Best banquet.



‚ÄúGene Woods earned his reputation for reducing disparities and enabling communities to achieve the highest health level‚Äù said Gerald Johnson Post Foundation president and publisher of The Charlotte Post. ‚ÄúOver an extended period he has helped others obtain equal access equity and inclusion in institutions that influence our lives.‚Äù



Woods said he is most proud of Atrium Health‚Äôs mission to improve health elevate hope and advance healing for all. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about me‚Äù he said ‚Äúbut about the folks I‚Äôve been privileged to work with and the communities we serve.‚Äù

The chairperson of Woods‚Äô executive committee calls him a transformational leader.



‚ÄúOne of the things I appreciate most about him is his willingness to listen to feedback and suggestions‚Äù said Angie Vincent-Hamacher chairs of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hospital Authority Board of Commissioners and partner at Robinson Bradshaw law firm. ‚ÄúIt helps everyone rise to the occasion and be their best.‚Äù



Woods‚Äô authenticity impresses Michael Lamach chairman of the Charlotte Executive Leadership Council and retired executive chair and CEO of Trane Technologies.



‚ÄúThe old saying ‚Äòa kind of friend a friend would like to have‚Äô captures Gene‚Äù Lamach said ‚Äúand I feel blessed to consider him a dear friend.‚Äù



Like many of his friends Woods said Lamach wants to lift up the most vulnerable and that matches Atrium Health‚Äôs initiatives.



‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made significant investments in affordable housing and food scarcity programs‚Äù Woods said. Atrium Health also works with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools and Johnson C. Smith University to expose young people ‚Äúto the wonderful opportunities in the healthcare field whether it‚Äôs life sciences or innovation.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm blessed to call Gene a mentor and friend‚Äù said Kieth Cockrell president of Bank of America Charlotte. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a contagious smile and a very positive outlook. People run to that. He surrounds himself with really exceptional people.‚Äù



Before taking the Atrium Health job six years ago Woods said he shared with interviewers his belief that the health care provider needed to carve out a significantly different future. A huge step was forging a partnership to create a Wake Forest School of Medicine campus in Charlotte. Atrium Health and Wake Forest University executives ‚Äúrealized we were looking to do something magical‚Äù he said.



The effort‚Äôs leaders decided to locate the medical school on 20 acres where the historic African American neighborhood of Brooklyn stood before urban renewal. Then they planned for it to anchor an innovation district called ‚ÄúThe Pearl‚Äù which will feature education retail apartments a hotel and open community space. It will welcome entrepreneurial activity and spur research and development.



‚ÄúThis is an opportunity to create some healing‚Äù Woods said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre listening to the community and that community is going to be lifted up by what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù



There is a strong commitment to supplier diversity and inclusion for construction of The Pearl.



‚ÄúUltimately good jobs and good opportunities help drive economic mobility of vulnerable communities‚Äù Woods said.



This spring Atrium Health and Advocate Aurora Health announced plans to combine and form a healthcare footprint across Illinois Wisconsin the Carolinas Georgia and Alabama. With Charlotte as headquarters the new organization will serve 5.5 million patients and employ more than 7600 physicians.



‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in conversations to build a national system with Advocate Aurora‚Äù Woods said. ‚ÄúThat takes a decade to build out and do it right.‚Äù



At 58 Woods plans to stay on the job indefinitely.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a better platform to reinvent healthcare promote education and drive equity than Atrium Health‚Äù he said.



The son of a Black Navy-career father and Spanish mother Woods has two grown sons. He spends leisure time with his guitar and for decades he‚Äôs written original jazz blues and rock tunes. He recently recorded a compact disc.



Lyrics in his compositions are a sort of diary for him reflecting his feelings and attitudes as he progressed in his career. Listening to his songs he feels: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm living my purpose.



I tell young people ‚Äòfind your passion‚Äô. If you know what your passion is you can outwork anybody. Chances are you‚Äôre going to be successful.‚Äù

Last Updated 2 years ago

Two major cruise companies have been applying different strategies to stay competitive in the cruise market and here‚Äôs what travelers should know.

Princess Cruises ‚Äîthe American cruise line owned by the Carnival Corporation‚Äî just introduced a new bidding program. The company will allow guests to bid for cabin upgrades on selected cruise ships starting September 6.

Norwegian Cruise Line on the other hand is currently offering 40% off all cruises and fly-cruises until August 22. The offer applies for all accommodations and includes routes like the Canary Islands from November 2022 inactive since 2017.

Both companies are offering great deals for cruise lovers but there are a few details travelers should consider.

Princess New Bidding Program

A few weeks ago Princess Cruises announced 47 itineraries for 2023 and 2024 and now the company is offering passengers the possibility to travel more comfortably with a new bidding system.

The new bidding program will allow guests to upgrade to a cabin with an ocean view a balcony a deluxe balcony a mini-suite or a full suite. Depending on their budget travelers will get to submit an offer from a certain price point.

John Padgett Princess President said: ‚ÄúUpgrading is a popular request from our guests and we‚Äôre pleased to deliver a process that lets them improve their stateroom category by making an offer that fits their budget and lifestyle.‚Äù

According to the information shared by Cruise Hive guests will receive an email with an invitation to participate. Bids will be priced per person but the stateroom will be available for two guests. After sending their bids participants will receive another email informing if their bid has been accepted and they get the upgrade or if it was denied and they just stay at their original stateroom.

The new stateroom upgrade system will be implemented on five cruises that sail from the US first: Regal Princess Ruby Princess Caribbean Princess Discovery Princess and Enchanted Princess. By October Princess Cruise Line expects to apply this system to all of its fleets.

The company is making its cruise experience more pleasant for travelers and finding strategies to create more inclusive programs. The cruise line also recently updated COVID-19 protocols and has removed vaccine requirements for most itineraries.

Norwegian‚Äôs 40% Discount

Travelers must act fast if they want to take advantage of this promotion. Those who have been thinking about sailing could have a great opportunity to book an itinerary at a great price. Norwegian‚Äôs 40% discount applies for all destinations until next Monday.

The company has also included its ‚ÄúFree at Sea‚Äù upgrade package ‚Äîwhich costs around $175‚Äî and offers travelers great advantages like free wifi free guided tours unlimited drinks and more.

Norwegian Cruise currently has itineraries in Alaska across the Caribbean and the Mediterranian Sea. The vessel Norwegian Sun currently has 8 to 14 days itineraries that include the Canaries and stops at Portugal Spain and Morocco. Norwegian Prima another great ship from this cruise line has itineraries in 2023 that include transatlantic sailing from New York to Reykjavik Iceland.

The cruise line is also offering travelers airfare credit up to $300 per person on selected routes in Europe. All these promotions will be available until next Monday.

Competitive Cruise Lines

Travelers must decide which promotion is a better fit for their travel plans. And while the cruise industry seems to be going ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù with fewer COVID-19 restrictions and more sailing routes available Princes Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line have also recently canceled sailings.

Just a few days ago Princess Cruises canceled 11 itineraries due to staff shortage labeled ‚Äúlabor challenges‚Äù by the company. And this week Norwegian Cruise Line canceled sailings planned for 2023 and 2024 due to supply chain delays. Both companies have offered compensation for customers but might be an important factor to consider when choosing a cruise line service and promotion.

NELSONVILLE Ohio (WOUB) ‚Äî For the first week of the season the Trimble Tomcats faced the Nelsonville-York Buckeyes for a Tri-Valley Conference showdown. Each team finished the 2021 season having won their respective conference title.

The Tomcats opened their season beating the Buckeyes the last four years and enter Boston Field looking to extend their win streak.

However with the help of the Buckeyes shutdown defense and impressive ground attack Nelsonville-York caged the Tomcats winning 16-0.

The first points of the game were rewarded to senior running back Hudson Stalder of the Buckeyes with just under two minutes left in the first quarter. Stalder would become a key player in this first game of the season after this 3-yard touchdown.

Stalder was a workhorse in the backfield for the Buckeyes tallying 10 carries for 45 yards and a touchdown.

Both defenses stepped up for the remainder of the first half. After giving up an early touchdown Trimble shut out the Buckeyes in the second quarter heading into the locker room down a touchdown.

With a one-score game both teams approached the second half with grit hungry to come out on top.

Despite a pass interference penalty against the Buckeyes Tommy Mitchell responded quickly with a fumble recovery with just under five minutes left in the third quarter.

With a blow of the whistle the Buckeyes started the fourth quarter hungry looking to make it a two-score game.

The Trimble defensive line was able to temporarily withstand the pressure forcing Nelsonville-York to settle for a field goal. Sophomore kicker Ben Perry secured three more points for the Buckeyes on the 20-yard attempt digging a two-score hole for the Tomcats.

Nelsonville-York thrived off this momentum applying seemingly endless pressure against Trimble. With the defensive line starting to crack Mitchell ran in for a 39-yard touchdown lengthening the divide between the two opponents and putting the nail in the coffin.

The Buckeyes look to continue this trend next week on the road against Newark Catholic.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ozuna was booked early Friday and released on bond later that morning. It was the second arrest in as many years for Ozuna who also was arrested in May 2021 on charges of aggravated assault by strangulation and battery after police officers said they witnessed him attacking his wife. Those charges were dropped after he completed a pretrial diversion program.

Ozuna the No. 8 hitter in Atlanta's lineup against the Houston Astros was greeted with a smattering of boos at Truist Park before his first at-bat Sunday in the second inning. The boos were much louder after Ozuna struck out against Astros right-hander Jose Urquidy.

Ozuna was booed again after another strikeout against Urquidy in the fifth inning. He was lifted for pinch-hitter Eddie Rosario later in the game and finished 0-for-2 in the Braves' 5-4 loss.

""I didn't want Eddie with his hamstring to play. Ronald [Acuna] was going to DH so we had to have somebody in left"" Braves manager Brian Snitker said when asked after the game why he started Ozuna. ""I told Marcell he's part of this team. He's going to play left field. ... He's on our team right now he's a member of our team. We're going to play him as needed.""

Ozuna asked after the game if he was annoyed or motivated by the boos said his reaction was the latter.

""It's kind of a motivator. Just don't listen to whatever they're saying keep my head up and do my best"" he said.

The game marked the first appearance since Aug. 14 for Ozuna who did not play in the first six games of Atlanta's seven-game homestand. Snitker said Friday that he spoke to Ozuna but did not provide details about their conversation. Snitker said he didn't know whether Ozuna will face a suspension.

The Braves issued a statement Friday after Ozuna's arrest saying the ""organization takes these matters very seriously and are obviously disappointed by the situation"" but declining to comment further citing the ongoing legal situation. Ozuna did not take questions Friday and made a brief statement to reporters saying he ""disappointed my team"" and ""disappointed my family.""

Ozuna 31 is in his third season in Atlanta and in the second year of a $65 million four-year contract. He batted .338 and led the National League with 18 home runs and 56 RBIs in 2020 but has dropped below .215 for two consecutive seasons.

Ozuna entered Sunday batting .214 with 20 homers and 46 RBIs this season -- substandard production that led to reduced playing time even before his arrest Friday.

Following his 2021 arrest Ozuna was placed on administrative leave during an MLB investigation and missed Atlanta's World Series championship run. He was then suspended for 20 games under MLB's domestic violence policy in November. The suspension was retroactive to Sept. 10 and covered the final 24 days of the 2021 regular season allowing him to return for the start of this season.

The pretrial diversion program that led to the previous charges being dropped included three to six months of supervision a 24-week family violence intervention program at least 200 hours of community service and an anger management course.

During his arrest the Braves outfielder apologized to cops once they approached his vehicle and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Ozuna from the Braves.‚Äù

He was later released on an $1830 bail and met with Atlanta general manager Alex Anthoploulos and manager Brian Snitker after the debacle.

‚ÄúI disappointed my team disappointed my family‚Äù he said after being released. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt have anything to say more and it‚Äôs a legal matter.‚Äù

The Braves later released a statement about Ozuna‚Äôs arrest announcing the organization is aware and disappointed by the incident.

Ozuna was also arrested last year for choking his wife which eventually led to him being charged with domestic battery.

In response to the incident with his wife MLB handed the outfielder a 20-game suspension."

‚ÄúI first want to praise all three of our quarterbacks as this was an unbelievable competition‚Äù McGuire said. ‚ÄúTyler has played well and put our offense in position to be effective consistently throughout camp which has earned him the right to be our starting quarterback.

Shough edged out Donovan Smith and Behren Morton in the quarterback competition although coach McGuire said that all three quarterbacks will likely see playing time in the opener. McGuire has said in the past he wants to have packages for each QB so that defenses have to prepare for each one.

Tyson Foods recently announced the company will invest $200 million at its Amarillo beef plant to expand and upgrade operations and build a new team member well-being area.

According to a news release the project will begin this fall and is expected to be completed by 2024.

The project involves construction of a 143000-square-foot addition to the existing beef complex which will house well-being areas including locker rooms cafeteria and office space as well as an expansion and enhancement to the facility‚Äôs currently existing operations floor. While the project itself is not expected to add jobs the Amarillo facility already employs 4000 people and generates an annual payroll of $180 million according to the company.

‚ÄúThank you to Tyson Foods for its continued commitment to the Amarillo area"" Kevin Carter Executive Director of the Amarillo Economic Development Corporation said in the release about the announcement which ""solidifies Tyson‚Äôs position as a top economic driver in our community for years to come and the $200 million capital expenditure illustrates a significant investment in Tyson Foods‚Äô future in Amarillo.‚Äù

The Amarillo plant is one of the largest of Tyson Foods‚Äô six beef facilities. The complex produces commodity cuts of fresh beef and specialty products and includes a ground beef patty operation; these products are packaged and boxed for sale to retail and foodservice customers throughout the U.S. and world.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exciting to see the economic growth in Potter County‚Äù said Potter County Judge Nancy Tanner after the Potter County Commissioners' Court recently voted to approve establishing a reinvestment zone at 5000 N. FM 1912 and entering an agreement for property tax abatement with Tyson Foods. ""Amarillo continues to be a place where existing businesses are able to thrive and expand and we are seeing that with Tyson Foods‚Äô commitment.‚Äù

The Amarillo plant's expansion will modernize the facility and prioritizes team member safety ergonomics and food safety. In addition it will incorporate enhanced automation and new technologies according to the company. The new space also supports several of Tyson Foods' sustainability efforts: Specially designed water utility equipment pumps and piping will automate and allow for a reduction in water usage.

‚ÄúThe feed mill will be a critical piece to our business operations and we look forward to seeing its impact across the United States and right here in Iowa‚Äù Noelle O‚ÄôMara group president for Tysons' Prepared Foods division said in a statment.

The new mill adds 69 acres to the company‚Äôs existing turkey complex in Storm Lake that includes grow-out facilities a research farm and processing plant. The company sources corn and soybean meal from around the region and contracts with about 70 farmers within a 60-miles radius of the Buena VIsta County seat to supply the majority of turkeys for its operation.

Company officials said the new investment allows its staff to use the latest technology to manufacture ideal formulated feed that consistently meets nutrient and quality requirements for optimal turkey health.

Tyson officials and commmunity leaders celebrated completion of the project Wednesday starting with a flag-raising event honoring the American and Iowa state flag. They then raised flags of the 22 countries where employees hail from.

Few can disagree.

The significance is profound for these governing long-standing HBCU sports entities founded over 100 years ago ‚Äî Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 1912 and Southwestern Athletic Conference in 1920. Corporate America and major broadcast networks have ignored or failed to recognize the economic benefit of affiliating with HBCU conferences.

For example State Farm Procter & Gamble United Wells Fargo Invesco QQQ Tyson Foods and Cricket Wireless are a few corporations that sponsored HBCU-related sporting events. Nevertheless the record with the three and four-letter broadcast networks has an underwhelming track record with HBCUs ‚Äî for many a year.

AN HBCU GO-TYPE PARTNERSHIP 'LONG OVERDUE'

The SWAC arrangement with HBCU GO is a ""long-term partnership to amplify and grow the sports floor program"" Byron Allen told me. ""This is the long overdue support to help them get the exposure the revenue they need to help fund these programs the schools and ultimately the education of these kids. It's a very important deal and historic deal.""

For HBCU conferences history may point back to 2022 as when media outlets began acknowledging the value of partnering with the brands of Jackson State Florida A&M Grambling Southern Howard Southern or South Carolina State. Then again eradicating the years of disenfranchisement by the suits on Madison Avenue would require the commissioners presidents and athletic directors to make transformational decisions for these brands.

HBCUs have had three choices served to them over the years. One we won't do business with you. Two we will pacify you with a spattering of support - just enough to keep you quiet. Third the corporate boardrooms will invite HBCUs to the table and strike new lucrative deals.

Question. Are we there yet?

COMPARE OR NOT COMPARE THAT IS THE QUESTION

After this week's mega-announcement of the Big 10's $7 billion television rights deal with FOX CBS and NBC are the HBCU conferences on the precipice of leaping into similar long-term accords?

The media mogul remarked how he was ""very proud of"" inking the multi-year contract with the SWAC but would not disclose the financial terms of the new alliance. ""I can't share the details. But it is a long-term partnership that we are both [SWAC and HBCU GO] very excited about"" Allen stated.

One source told me it's a 10-year $120 million agreement between the SWAC and HBCU GO. I contacted the SWAC conference office to verify the details. A representative would only confirm that the SWAC signed a multi-year distribution contract with Allen's free-streaming platform.

Allen affirmed a few particulars from our first conversation in February 2022. ""We did a deal with them [SWAC] for over 2000 live-sporting events. That's football men's and women's basketball men's and women's volleyball other sports; it's everything the entire spectrum.""

HOW HBCUs WILL BE WATCHED WITH HBCU GO CBS

On August 16 Allen Media Group officially announced after signing separate distribution partnerships with the SWAC and CIAA that HBCU GO will distribute the conferences' content via CBS-owned-and-operated duopoly stations. Also HBCU GO has secured distribution with group-owned television stations including Nexstar Gray Cox Scripps Tegna Sinclair Lockwood Allen Media Broadcasting Hearst Circle City Broadcasting McKinnon Broadcasting Cowles Graham Block Sun Broadcasting Tougaloo College Sagamore Hill and Marquee.

""These games will be some of the very first games that will be on digital broadcast and cable simultaneously"" Allen noted. ""So this will be on the streaming app HBCU GO and the Grio streaming app Local Now SPORTS.TV and over-the-air broadcast. That's the syndication we've put together to align them for broadcast television stations with CBS being the lead group. Nexstar Gray Cox Scripps Tegna Sinclair Lockwood Allen Media Broadcasting Hearst Circle City Broadcasting McKinnon Broadcasting Cowles Graham Block Sun Broadcasting Tougaloo College Sagamore Hill and Marquee and our cable network. The Grio has 50 plus million homes available to 50 plus million homes.""

A few weeks ago AMG (Allen Media Group) acquired the Black News Channel (BCN) and its assets for a reported $11 million out of bankruptcy. Allen converted and merged BCN into The Grio. ""Anybody who wants to see an HBCU game will not have any problems accessing them via digital via over-the-air broadcast and via cable. It's 100% penetration across the board collectively"" Allen declared.

HBCU GO's IMPACT AND REACH FOR THE SWAC AND CIAA

The SWAC and CIAA grant HBCU GO the rights to their conferences' sporting events to broadcast via cable linear streaming broadcast VOD [video-on-demand} and pay-per-view. Syndication becomes a possibility for HBCU GO to be packaged in future deals for distribution on other networks. For clarity neither AMG Allen nor the SWAC verified with HBCU Legends that the conferences would or would not receive revenue from syndication of their content on HBCU GO.

Byron Allen mentioned the CBS deal would place HBCU GO in ""approximately 60% of all US households and approximately 67% of all African American households.""

The HBCU GO platform will have a global reach for HBCU sports fans to access games and events.

Even Jackson State's head coach understands how this will impact the families of the young men on his football team. Deion Sanders was very candid with Allen and told him ""We need some support. These young kids are here and they want their mamas to see them play. So we're help them to make sure their mamas can see them play"" Allen exclaimed.

ARE HBCUs NOW IN A POSITION OF POWER?

""We've gone from zero to now a deal has been done. Is it a multi-billion dollar deal? It is not. Have they [HBCUs] been there and available for over a century and decades? Yes. Have they been ignored? Yes. We are starting the process of reversing that.""

Allen continued ""The greatest trade deficit in America is the trade deficit between White corporate America and Black America. Why is it that Byron Allen in 2022 becomes the first person to take the sports content put it on digital broadcast and cable and push the conversation to provide distribution and economic inclusion for the HBCUs? Some pretty big corporations out there that didn't seem to care before now.""

He's correct. HBCUs are now sexy for the advertising agencies to seek new partnerships and promote the so-called ""black agenda"" to their clients' consumers. As compelling as it seems business and profitability must become the central concerns for the SWAC CIAA MEAC CIAC and other HBCU conferences and their member institutions.

Should HBCUs and their fans applaud these deals today later or at all?

It's not for me to say.

One thing is clear. Now is the time for the conferences to capitalize and take a position of power to dictate the new partnership terms. If they do not it will be same ol' business as usual for historically black colleges and universities.

In our conversation Byron Allen told me that Dr. Martin Luther King's widow Coretta Scott King once shared this wise statement. ""The greatest weapon we have is the truth.""

Will the truth set HBCUs free to control and navigate the economics of their media rights and future deals? Will commissioners Dr. Charles McClelland (SWAC) and Jacqie McWilliams (CIAA) keep their respective conferences protected and profitable? And will HBCU GO help to revolutionize HBCU sports in the SWAC and CIAA? Once again Byron Allen believes it would.

Kevin O‚ÄôConnell didn‚Äôt take any chances with his potential starters as the Minnesota Vikings lost to the San Francisco 49ers 17-7 in their lone home preseason game at U.S. Bank Stadium Saturday night.

For that matter neither did 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan. The Vikings did not play any offensive or defensive starters and sat 27 players in total. That means we won‚Äôt see Kirk Cousins Adam Thielen Justin Jefferson Dalvin Cook Danielle Hunter Za‚ÄôDarius Smith Eric Kendricks Harrison Smith Patrick Peterson and other starters until Sept. 11 against the Green Bay Packers.

Shanahan followed suit as the 49ers sat Marshall native Trey Lance Jimmy Garoppolo Deebo Samuel George Kittle and Nick Bosa among all their starters and 27 players in total. The Vikings and 49ers held joint practices over two days this week at TCO Performance Center where the first-team offenses and defenses for each squad got in enough work that both coaches felt it wasn‚Äôt worth risking injury in a preseason game.

""Eighty-plus plays a little over 48 hours ago for our 1s against another team‚Äôs 1s. I kind of planned long ago that we would handle this week like this. Our game reps took place at our facility this week in that competitive environment that we were able to bring in"" O'Connell said.

Kellen Mond got the start at quarterback and if he had the edge for the No. 2 spot going into the game he took a step back Saturday. Mond finished 10-of-20 passing for 82 yards was intercepted twice sacked once and finished with a 21.3 rating. Sean Mannion entered on the final play of the first quarter and led the Vikings‚Äô only touchdown drive of the first half. He went 4-of-4 passing on a drive that ended with rookie Ty Chandler scoring from three yards out. Mannion finished the night 10-of-15 for 65 yards and a 75.7 rating.

""I felt like both guys at times tonight had good rhythm and good command we just couldn‚Äôt make that one play make that one throw make that one play to kind of trigger and ignite the offense that we really needed"" O'Connell said. ""Ultimately we‚Äôve just got to be better. We‚Äôre trying to see who can come off the bench and help us win a football game. For the most part we‚Äôve just got to try to continue to improve and limit the turnovers and see who can win this thing.""

Both of Mond's interceptions were under thrown to their intended receivers and the second came in the fourth quarter where he never saw safety Tayler Hawkins trying to hit Jalen Nailor deep.

""Gave the safety an easy pick so that was obviously a really bad mistake on my part"" Mond said.

The Vikings have one preseason game left to figure out the No. 2 quarterback position. O'Connell was asked after the game if they're confident in Mannion and Mond to win the No. 2 job or if that player isn't currently on the roster.

""Ultimately you would love to have come out of the night feeling like shoot they both moved the team and scored a lot of points. We‚Äôve got a heck of a hard discussion and conversation to have as a staff"" O'Connell said. ""In my mind the clock is going. Although I feel like our starters are in a great spot for Sept. 11 and that‚Äôs what our emphasis is really on there‚Äôs a lot of jobs we‚Äôve got to still allow to still play themselves out so we feel good about the overall depth of our team. We‚Äôll certainly allow that to happen this week.""

After two sacks last week T.Y. McGill had 2.5 sacks Saturday and nearly got to the quarterback on another play in the third quarter. He also blew up a play that caused a 49ers‚Äô fumble near the goal line. Patrick Jones II added a half sack.

The Vikings lost rookie defensive back Andrew Booth Jr. for the game to an ankle injury in the second quarter. Booth made three tackles before a non-contact injury and he needed help from two trainers to get off the field. O'Connell said after the game it was an aggravation of an injury Booth already had that they knew of and didn't sound overly concerned.

The new legislation which President Biden signed into law last Tuesday allocates $369 billion to establish and extend a wide range of programs designed to attract private-sector investments in renewable energy and other projects to mitigate the risks of climate change.

Much of the IRA's climate provisions provide tax incentives and grants to be disbursed by environmentally focused ""green banks"" and other lenders to back renewable projects develop clean technologies renovate buildings for energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In total the IRA's funding for climate initiatives has been hailed as the largest federal climate investment to date. But rather than taking a punitive approach ‚Äî cracking down on corporate emissions or carbon-intensive forms of energy production for example ‚Äî the law instead provides an abundance of incentives for private capital to flow toward climate-friendly projects.

Offering ""carrots over sticks"" to banks investors and corporations is ""the continuation of policies that already have a long history"" in U.S. climate initiatives according to Pavel Molchanov a director and analyst with Raymond James.

""The only approach to decarbonization that is politically viable [in the U.S.] is to hand out carrots to invest in renewable and low-carbon energy"" Molchanov said.

But the sheer amount of climate investment contained within the IRA is undoubtedly significant and banks ‚Äî particularly those who have already begun to explore climate- and sustainability-minded growth strategies ‚Äî stand to benefit greatly as the funds and incentives roll out in the coming years.

""The Inflation Reduction Act is a huge positive for banks that are anywhere close to adopting climate change strategies"" said Ivan Frishberg chief sustainability officer of Amalgamated Bank in New York. ""This is almost purely opportunity.""

""So much of the economy needs to transition"" Frishberg added ""and banks are going to benefit from that transition.""

Others in the industry say the law is likely to encourage many banks to explore strategies focused on climate and sustainability finance for the first time. That might involve some growing pains and banks interested in making a climate-minded lending pivot will need to be diligent in their compliance efforts.

Jae Easterbrooks vice president and earth services team leader at Beneficial State Bank in Oakland California said Beneficial began environmental lending in 2007. The bank was later able to access some climate-focused grant funds set aside by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. That experience was instructive for Beneficial in determining what kinds of climate-centered loans were worth pursuing Easterbrooks said.

""We learned how to avoid and sidestep the wrong deals"" Easterbrooks said. ""There will be inexperienced or wannabe project developers coming around this time as well.""

So far however bank trade associations have had a muted response to passage of the IRA. No major bank trade group released any statement acknowledging the law's passage on Tuesday including the American Bankers Association Bank Policy Institute Consumer Bankers Association and the Independent Community Bankers of America.

""It was amazing to me how seemingly silent banks have been on this legislation given how much opportunity it presents to them"" said Frishberg.

Advocates for climate preparedness have largely cheered the scale of federal investment secured by the IRA's passage. While $369 billion may be a trifling amount compared to what scientists and progressives argue will be necessary to limit the worst impacts of climate change in the coming decades banks and other lenders will have the opportunity to leverage such funds exponentially in the coming years.

Nicole Buell director for federal climate innovation at the Environmental Defense Fund wrote this week that ""this federal funding only scratches the surface of the law's transformative impact on our economy."" The group estimates that a $38.7 billion pot set aside to bolster existing Department of Energy loan programs for instance could generate as much as $385 billion in private investment.

""Taken together these climate finance programs have the ability to unlock hundreds of billions of dollars from the private sector"" Buell wrote. ""This could bolster the law's power to lower energy costs build healthier communities create good-paying jobs and drive progress on our climate goals.""

The IRA also authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency to infuse a fresh round of funding into the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund ‚Äî a total of $27 billion that the Environmental Defense Fund estimates could leverage as much as $72 billion in private investment.

Notably one-third of the money set aside for the newly flush Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund was reserved by Congress for low-income communities and their efforts to improve climate preparedness. That $7 billion could provide a significant opportunity for community development financial institutions  a subset of Treasury Department-certified lenders that specialize in lending to underserved communities across the U.S.

But others see certain risks for financial firms particularly for any who rush headlong toward the IRA's climate funding without having a meaningful understanding of the compliance challenges and pitfalls of such programs.

""You've seen the headlines about greenwashing and the impacts of when companies are not paying attention and jump in without actually having a well-thought-out strategy"" said Melissa Klimek senior manager of the financial services climate practice at Baringa Partners US.

""The banking sector needs to be thinking about SEC regulations"" Klimek added ""and they have to make sure that their internal processes and definitions for what sustainable finance means to them is clearly articulated and aligned with what is covered from an [Inflation Reduction Act] investment standpoint.""

In a client note published by Morgan Lewis on the day the IRA was signed the law firm echoed those concerns noting that while ""the 'green bank' fund creates a tremendous opportunity for non-profit green banks and private sector entities whose renewable energy projects receive investments grant applicants should note that potential missteps ‚Äî and misstatements ‚Äî could lead to False Claims Act and other forms of liability.""

It remains to be seen whether the IRA will have a direct negative impact on the traditional energy sector in the years to come. The law contains some key concessions for oil and gas companies including a rule for the Department of Interior that the government office bureau does not lease more federal land for solar and wind production unless it has leased a certain amount of land for fossil fuel production.

But proponents for the clean energy sector say that the IRA's climate investment will make clean energy more widely available and in turn represent less price volatility for lenders than the oil and gas sector historically has.

""The faster we transition the energy mix the more stable prices will become over the long term"" said Frishberg. ""Anything that is less volatile is easier to finance.""

Beyond the IRA Democratic congressional leadership has already announced that they intend to take up legislation later this fall that will reform a wider swath of the federal government's oil and gas leasing process . But at the same time there is reason to believe that such a package may have long odds passing the current Congress.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzA4NGIzOTc0LTc2M2YtNGE5Ni04NjZlLTNhY2YyOWE5ZmQ4Y9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global scope of EU's greenwashing crackdown spooks Wall Street,"Print this page

Global warming is by definition a global problem. But the worldwide scope of the EU‚Äôs latest climate change effort ‚Äî designed to end the practice of describing things as greener than they really are ‚Äî is provoking alarm on Wall Street.

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive agreed in principle with little fanfare earlier this summer and due to come into force from next June compels all ‚Äúlarge‚Äù companies that operate in the EU or have listed securities in the bloc to produce extensive new reports on the effects of their business and of their parent companies on the environment.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs deliberately global in application‚Äù said Chris McGarry lawyer at White Case. ‚ÄúThat obviously makes sense because we‚Äôre talking about global issues.‚Äù Andrew Hobbs of EY said the rules had become more extraterritorial than the EU‚Äôs original proposals.

For banks such as Morgan Stanley or JPMorgan it means producing reports for businesses that sprawl across dozens of regions and are multiple times the size of their EU-based entities. Some bankers also say it is off-putting for their clients ‚Äî an Asian company that lists a single debt instrument in the EU will have to produce reams of audited information about its entire business.

‚ÄúThe extraterritoriality is bonkers‚Äù a policy expert at a large US institution told the Financial Times. One of his peers at another large US bank described the CSRD as one of the most pressing policy issues on his plate even as the EU fine-tunes hundreds of pages of new capital rules this autumn.

The directive introduces mandatory audited corporate reporting on a vast range of environmental social and governance impacts including greenhouse gas emissions and internal risks and controls. On the environmental side they include metrics such as climate change mitigation strategies pollution and the impact on biodiversity and ecosystems.

That‚Äôs a big ask across enormous global businesses banks and their lobbyists say especially when the terminology may not be compatible with other global work and the exact details of what they will have to report at group level haven‚Äôt been pinned down yet.

All big companies could make the same arguments but banks feel particularly aggrieved by two elements in the EU‚Äôs plans.

One gripe is that the reports must capture the effects of companies themselves and of companies they do business with. Financial services companies‚Äô returns will have to capture the activities of their clients. But financial and non-financial services companies must report on the same day. Banks are arguing that their deadline should be later.

‚ÄúThere is genuine concern around liability (for inaccurate information) particularly in the US . . . around likely litigation if they don‚Äôt have the availability and reliability of data they need to be able to make their own disclosures because they can‚Äôt get that from their clients‚Äù one industry lobbyist said.

The second bank-specific complaint is the imposition of the full whack of rules on foreign companies that list any instrument in the EU‚Äôs markets such as a Japanese company issuing a small bond that can only be sold to institutional investors in Paris or Amsterdam or Frankfurt.

The agreement reached in June will continue to grind its way through the Brussels machinery in September when there will be a final plenary vote in the European parliament.

Banks are hoping to get a decent hearing on claims that the most recent draft is unclear ‚Äî the more optimistic policy experts think the tidying up will mean that companies whose only EU activity is issuing securities get the same reprieve as those offered to small and medium-sized listed businesses. These have been promised obligations that are ‚Äúproportionate to the capacities and resources of SMEs . . . and relevant to the scale and complexity of their activities‚Äù.

But they privately admit that the ‚Äúship has sailed‚Äù on the extraterritoriality even if they are at odds with the greater European project of creating debt and equity markets as broad and deep as those in the US.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to kill off European capital markets like this‚Äù the policy expert says. He adds that while there might be an argument for uniform information covering EU-listed equities extending the requirement to all securities will drive companies away.

The policy expert expects companies that only use the EU‚Äôs capital markets a little to not use them at all. London may be the beneficiary since it offers a diverse source of funding without incurring the burden of the new rules. ‚ÄúThis contradicts the goal for Capital Markets Union (CMU) they know that‚Äù the first banker says of the stance Brussels is taking. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much you can do on that level . . . climate takes supremacy.‚Äù

After the NFL canceled the 2020 preseason and football carried on normally after that there was no reason to put starters in ever again. It‚Äôs clear Vikings new head coach Kevin O‚ÄôConnell would prefer that his starters stay healthy rather than showing them off to the public for three drives.

""Kind of planned long ago that we would kind of handle this week like this our game reps took place at our facility this week in that competitive environment that we were able to bring in"" O'Connell said referring to joint practices with the 49ers.

That doesn‚Äôt mean it was completely meaningless for the players on the field for the Vikings. Many of them might make a difference at some point and they sure as heck won‚Äôt be getting many legit practice reps after the third week of training camp.

The Vikings did their best to keep fans entertained having Sylvia Fowles of the Lynx blow the gjallarhorn and putting a brilliant sax player out there for the national anthem. Early in the game they put up a ‚ÄúGriddy Cam‚Äù and showed Justin Jefferson dancing. The kids in the stands danced along.

Backup quarterback Kellen Mond led the offense onto the field for their first drive with hopes of clarifying the muddy No. 2 situation. For a minute it looked like he might take command. Mond rolled out on third-and-6 and found receiver Bisi Johnson open across the middle for a 16-yard gain. A quality athletic play with velocity on the ball.

Mond‚Äôs fortune changed almost instantly though. After a 13-yard Alexander Mattison run (no trade requests please) the second-year QB got pressured by the 49ers and flung a Brett Favre-level risky pass to the sideline with hopes of delivering a brilliant dime for a touchdown. Instead the pass came about seven yards short of its target and was intercepted easily by a reserve safety named George Odum.

""Ultimately we've just gotta be better"" O'Connell said. ""I think in the end we're trying to see who can come of the bench and help us win a football game.""

The Vikings got a fourth down stop on the 49ers‚Äô first drive but not before Nate Sudfeld made an impressive throw on a bootleg that was caught right in front of Lewis Cine. Starter Cam Bynum got the night off. Oh and yes Sudfeld is the guy best known for making the Eagles really mad at Doug Pederson when he played over Jalen Hurts late in a 2020 game so they could get better draft position. Ah memories.

With some energy in the building off the fourth down stop Mond threw an incompletion in the dirt near Kene Nwangwu and then checked it down to the speedy running back for a 1-yard gain on third-and-9. Don‚Äôt even think about making the joke that he‚Äôs trying too hard to emulate the starter. The Vikings punted.

They got the ball back after DJ Wonnum pressured Sudfeld into an incompletion. Mond‚Äôs luck wasn‚Äôt any better on his third drive. Former top draft pick defensive tackle Javon Kinlaw welcomed Ingram to the NFL and Mond took a sack. In total his first three drives produced 43 passing yards on 10 throws a turnover and eight yards lost to the Kinlaw sack. Kinlaw did the Griddy.

If we want to rub salt in the wound against non-third teamers Mond has been in charge of four drives in the first halves of preseason games and scored three points.

Mannion took over and immediately hit a bootleg pass for seven yards. Then he stepped up in the pocket and put his entire back into a third down throw and winged it behind an open receiver.

Brock Purdy came in for the 49ers. Mr. Irrelevant in the previous draft for those wondering at home. That went about how you‚Äôd expect and San Francisco punted.

Ihmir Smith-Marsette whose punt returning has been an adventure was stripped after a nine-yard return and San Francisco booted a field goal through to light up the scoreboard for the first time in the 2022 US Bank Stadium campaign. Of course they might have put up a seven had fifth-string tight end Tanner Hudson not dropped a pass in the flat.

Mannion got it together and completed back-to-back passes to tight ends Nick Muse and Zach Davidson. It was eye-catching that Ingram remained at right guard into the second quarter. We have already crowned him as the starter instead of veteran Jesse Davis but maybe now that‚Äôs less clear.

Ty Chandler had a nice five-yard run and catch out of the backfield. He‚Äôs the best Mr. Mankato candidate thus far.

Through his first seven passes Mannion averaged 2.9 yards per attempt.

The Vikings punted again.

The big screen showed a guy with a half purple and half gold No. 93 jersey. He had Viking horns a mohawk and moves that suggested it wasn‚Äôt his first time on a jumbotron. People got a kick out of that. At that point the first paper airplane came sailing down from above the press box. Last year fans became so bored during one of the preseason games that the giant voice guy had to ask them over the loudspeaker to stop throwing the airplanes.

Anyway T.Y. McGill and Patrick Jones sacked Purdy with just under 5:00 left in the second quarter. Players like them are the reason we are still doing this dance outside of the fact the league can make season ticket holders pay full price for these games. Jones has gotten a lot of second-team reps and the Vikings may end up needing him if Za‚ÄôDarius Smith or Danielle Hunter have to miss time. McGill isn‚Äôt a future prospect but if the Vikings aren‚Äôt going to sign Ndamukong Suh they are going to need some depth players to be reliable. McGill has probably made the best case for a backup job with a huge game.

""He's one of those guys that flashed to me"" O'Connell said. He wrecked multiple plays tonight.""

On the same play as the McGill sack a demonstration of why everyone important was hanging out on the sideline: Rookie Andrew Booth Jr. stayed down on the field and three trainers came out to meet him. He needed their help to hobble off the field. Not that it isn‚Äôt concerning since Booth Jr. has potential and might be needed if there are injuries in the secondary but that would be far more problematic if it were a starter.

At the two-minute warning Mannion was up to 5.1 yards per attempt. Trishton Jackson an emerging contender for WR6 made an adjustment and snatched a pass out of the air for 17 yards and then he hit back-to-back 7-yard throws to Bisi Johnson and Smith-Marsette. The possibility of a touchdown didn‚Äôt exactly spark uncontrollable energy in the building but the crowd did react to the video board showing Brett Favre‚Äôs famous 2009 throw against San Francisco. Still unbelievable right?

It was announced in the press box that Booth Jr. would be out for the game with an ankle injury. He was the same second-rounder who said that he hadn‚Äôt been healthy since high school on his post-draft press conference. The Vikings have to hope this doesn‚Äôt become a trend because he‚Äôs very talented.

""It was kind of that same ankle he's kind of dealt with"" O'Connell said. ""It sounds like it's a positive thing from a standpoint of just an aggravation of an injury that we know about already. He's worked his way through that throughout camp.""

Ty Chandler update: The fifth-round running back plowed into the end zone to get the Vikings on the board with 1:39 left. He waited for a hole and then put his head down and slammed forward for the touchdown. The Vikings have a lot of good running backs. It‚Äôs hard to say whether this preseason will be enough for them to move on from either their starter or No. 2 after this year but the signs are there for Chandler and Nwangwu in the future.

That touchdown by the way was the first on a drive led by Mannion of the preseason. But he showed competency on the drive that has been difficult to find for Vikings backup QBs.

Harrison Hand and Nate Hairston came in the game at corner if you were wondering where the depth goes after Booth Jr.

McGill got after Purdy again but the former Iowa State QB actually made some quality tosses hitting receiver Malik Turner on third down for 21 yards into double coverage. Instantly a tweet came into my mentions wondering if Purdy was available for trade. Two incomplete deep shots later and the 49ers kicked a field goal to make the game 7-6 an absolutely appropriate score considering how things went in the first half.

A little kid flag football team came out on the field at halftime. The biggest roar of the day was when one of them juked out his mini opponents and scored a touchdown. The kid did it again a few plays later and hit the Griddy.

The 49ers started the second half with the ball and the most noticeable lineup inclusions were last year‚Äôs mid-round picks Janarius Robinson and Chazz Surratt. It appears the new regime isn‚Äôt interested in their services. Jaylen Twyman didn‚Äôt make his way onto the field until the end of the third quarter which may put him in line for a practice squad position rather than being a rotational rusher.

Purdy brought the 49ers to the goal line but fumbled a snap which was picked up by outside linebacker Luiji Vilain. He did not see second-team reps on Saturday night so he needed the big play.

Mond returned to the field for the Vikings‚Äô first drive of the second half. Speaking of the 2021 third round there was still no sight of Wyatt Davis who was once touted as the future starter. Albert Wilson got his first look. He may be on the Kendall Wright or Jordan Taylor path of confusing offseason veteran receiver signings. Zach Davidson dropped a pass over the middle which has been a camp trend and the reason why Johnny Mundt and Ben Ellefson have gotten so many first-team reps during camp.

Sudfeld came back in at QB for the 49ers. The San Francisco running back Tyrion Davis-Price ran over three guys on one play and the third quarter ended with the 49ers on the move. Airplanes fluttered down from the rafters with more frequency. ‚ÄúTurn down for what‚Äù blared over the loudspeaker. The crowd largely remained the same from kickoff as the twilight faded outside.

Sudfeld threw a touchdown from the 2-yard line. The PA announcer needed a correction to get the receiver right and then somehow there was a timeout before San Francisco went for two. The Vikings left a receiver wide wide wide open on the conversion and San Fran went up 14-7 with 14 minutes and 57 merciful seconds remaining.

Mannion came back in to operate the offense and made the best pass of the entire preseason heaving a pass down the middle of the field to a wide open Davidson. He could have run all the way to St. Paul without being touched but the ball bounced off his hands and fell to the turf. Mannion should have seen his yards per pass shoot through the roof and instead got a zero in the box score. He threw another incompletion on third down and the Vikings punted.

The 49ers put the Vikings‚Äô chances at a preseason victory out of range with a field goal to go up 17-7 but not before fourth-round pick Akayleb Evans made a strong punch at the ball to force a fumble.

Mond remained in the game in the final moments of the fourth quarter. He let loose on a deep pass into double coverage that was knocked away and then whipped a pass way over the head of an open Myron Mitchell. When Mond did send a good throw Mitchell‚Äôs way he let it slip through his hands.

Mond finished his miserable evening with another interception on an ill-advised inaccurate pass and a smattering of boos could be heard from those still paying attention. He ended the game with a 82 yards on 20 passes and a 21.3 passer rating. You could argue it was a step back after his fourth quarter showing last week but only if you thought that it meant something.

""The last interception I think he just lost track of where that post safety was and tried to press to make that play that we were trying to make all night"" O'Connell said.

While there may not have been a ton of highlight moments or major takeaways about the things that matter for the 2022 season the biggest development from the Vikings‚Äô loss to the 49ers is that this might be the game we remember as the last fleeting moment of discussion about Mond as a trustworthy option right now.

Other than that the lack of starters and action made it hard to get amped about anything else from Saturday night‚Äôs contest.

Until Wednesday he'd never pulled over to rescue people from a burning building.

At around 8 a.m. Sam was driving a passenger from Brooklyn New York to LaGuardia Airport when he noticed people in pajamas gawking and pointing phones at walk-up in the city's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. At first he thought the ruckus was caused by a fight but when a piece of debris fell from a second-story window he realized the building was in flames.

With his passenger's permission he pulled over to gauge the situation. And when someone said there were still residents inside Sam says a flip switched inside of his brain and he rushed into the smoke-filled property.

""I get tunnel vision in those situations"" Sam 54 tells CNBC Make It. ""I don't want to get hurt but when people need help I just want to do the right thing.""

Sam says he spent about six minutes inside and guided two residents by hand out of the building. One of them told them it was their AC unit that had caught on fire. She appeared to be in shock and hesitant to leave the hallway.

""I looked at her and said 'I'm not leaving until you leave'"" he says.

Firefighters entered the building as he helped a second person out. Sam says he spent a few minutes checking on the people he helped then someone tapped his on the shoulder and handed him his keys. In all the chaos he had parked in front of a fire hydrant and another passerby re-parked his car down the block.

He also had unknowingly handed his phone to someone standing outside the building. It was promptly returned.

""It was a matter of right people being at the right place at the right time"" Sam says. ""The passenger wasn't like 'Oh let's just go.' She cared too.""

The passenger a writer named Jemimah Wei tells CNBC Make It that she followed Sam onto the sidewalk and joined the chorus of people yelling to residents to evacuate. She says she was touched by Sam's ""strong moral compass.""

Ultimately Sam and Wei got back into the car and made it to the airport on time. Wei later tweeted photos from the fire commenting: ""People are good.""

The thread went viral.

Sam says he doesn't consider his actions to be all that spectacular. ""There's nothing special about me"" he says. ""I think this is in everyone.""

He says his parents owned a yellow taxi company while he was growing up and he once pulled over to check on someone whose car had burst into flames. ""I hope I never have to do something like this again but I can't say I won't"" Sam says. ""You'd be surprised what any given moment can bring out in you.""

On the phone Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi asked Sam for his story and thanked him for his efforts Sam says. The company issued a statement expressing gratitude for having ""such a heroic and thoughtful member [in] our community.""

Sam says he hasn't been compensated for his actions and he doesn't expect to be.

""In the service industry it's our job to take care of passengers and people"" he says. ""I think it's just in my nature to want to do small things that can make a big difference.""

NEW UBER FEATURES

Uber Charter is just one of the various new features the company announced earlier their year for both its e-hail and delivery services.

In May the company announced the launch of Uber Travel which allows users to reserve rides for each leg of their vacation itinerary in one convenient location.

‚ÄúJust connect your Gmail account and we‚Äôll do the rest organizing your hotel flight and restaurant reservations all in one place for a stress-free travel experience‚Äù said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi.

Uber also unveiled a new Vouchers for Events feature which allows customers to create unique promotional codes that can be distributed to event attendees in order to cover their trips.

‚ÄúSimply enter your event details the maximum amount that you want to cover and share your unique code with your guests. Guests will determine their own pickup and drop-off at a time and location that works best for them and you‚Äôll avoid overpaying for unused seats‚Äù Khosrowshahi said.

Normally when I forgo parking fees and take a nine-minute Uber or Lyft ride to Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU) it costs between $14 and $16.

As most frequent ride-hailing customers know though the price you actually find when you plug in a ride is not always what you'd expect. This was particularly true in 2020 and 2021 when driver shortages fueled a combination of long waits and often unpredictable surge pricing.

For more travel news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for TPG's daily newsletter.

After a flight earlier this year I plugged my address into Uber as I walked toward ground transportation. I was surprised to find the cost at almost $40 for the brief ride. It was a similar story on the Lyft app.

I pondered going to get a taxi but instead decided to just wait a bit and then check back; I accepted the fact that I'd probably be sitting around for a half hour in hopes of overpaying by $15 to $20 instead of by $25 or more.

After just two or three minutes though I was pleasantly surprised that the fare didn't just drop by half ... it dropped right back to where I'd normally expect it. I paid a quite typical $14.97 for the ride home.

It's a reminder that the price you find when you plug a route into your ride-hailing app can largely be a snapshot in time. If you're hoping to save money there are a few tactics you can try whether you're landing at an airport or leaving a busy gathering.

Look early check often

A variety of factors drive the price you'll pay for a ride through ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft. Namely it's a supply-and-demand equation: If a lot of people are looking for rides and a relatively small number of drivers are available there's a good chance you'll pay more.

It's the reason you can end up paying a lot more than normal when trying to get a ride after a concert sporting event or at an airport after a bunch of flights just landed.

As I learned earlier this year the price can change dramatically from one moment to the next so one of the best things you can do is monitor the situation as closely as possible.

This means checking your Uber or Lyft app as soon as you land potentially while you're still in your seat on the plane.

If it's going to be a 25-minute wait for a ride this may be a good time to go ahead and book your ride (or at least once you're off the plane).

Checking early can both give you a good sense of how long you might be waiting for a ride ‚Äî and thus when you might want to book it ‚Äî and what the prices are.

If the fare is higher than you're expecting you may want to take your time heading to the airport exit refreshing the app to see if the prices start trending downward again. If you find a great fare it may be a good time to hustle to the pickup area so you can lock the good price in before it spikes.

Of course if you book your ride early it's important to be sure you have enough time to actually make it to the rideshare pickup area before your ride arrives or else you could face cancellation fees. So be sure to consider factors like how long it will take you to walk to the pickup area and whether you checked luggage before locking in a ride.

Consider other Uber Lyft app functions

If you don't think fares on Uber or Lyft are going to come down or if you're waiting and not having any luck you may want to consider one of the other functions the apps offer.

In addition to sharing and splitting a ride with a stranger ‚Äî a more feasible option now than it was during the height of the pandemic ‚Äî there are also ways to essentially de-prioritize yourself in the queue in favor of a better fare.

Namely Lyft has a ""wait and save"" function where you can delay your pickup a bit but enjoy a discount on your ride. This could be an especially useful option when you're still far away from the pickup area.

There are also ways to book a ride in advance locking in your price ahead of time. For instance Uber Reserve is available for typical rides as well as for pickups from dozens of airports nationwide; you can schedule it up to 30 days ahead of time and your driver will be alerted of your flight status. Be sure to check and see if the price is right before booking this way.

Bottom line

Even though more drivers have joined Uber and Lyft in recent months there are still times when you'll find fares far higher than you'd like when trying to get a ride from an airport. By beginning your ride-searching process as soon as you land ‚Äî and checking back often ‚Äî or using the alternative ride options the apps offer you may be able to ward off unpleasant wait times and prices.

He stopped to evacuate the residents,"CNN ‚Äî

Uber driver Fritz Sam is being hailed a ‚Äúhero‚Äù by the company‚Äôs CEO after he sprang into action and helped evacuate residents from a burning building in New York City.

Sam was driving his passenger Jemimah Wei through Brooklyn to the airport around 8 a.m. on Wednesday when they came across a four-story brownstone on Classon Avenue that was on fire he told CNN.

Sam said he noticed flames coming out of a second-floor apartment window but did not see any first responders at the scene yet so he felt compelled to help. With permission from his passenger Sam parked his car and ran towards the fire.

Wei soon followed him and along with the help of other neighbors they began to yell ‚Äúfire‚Äù to wake up any sleeping residents who were still in the building. When Sam asked neighbors if anyone else was in the building he did not get a definite answer so without giving it a second thought he ran into the building to check for any remaining residents he told CNN.

At this point the fire was still contained to a second-floor apartment so Sam was able to navigate the building with his mind set on evacuating any remaining residents before the fire got worse Sam said.

He located a woman on the second floor and a man on the first floor and accompanied both to safety he told CNN.

According to both Sam and Wei firefighters arrived shortly after the last resident exited the building. Sam comforted the residents and made sure they were OK before returning to his car to finish the ride he had started.

The day also had a happy ending for Wei who took to Twitter to praise Sam.

‚ÄúOn the way to the airport this morning and drove by a burning building my Uber driver LEAPT out of the car and INTO the building while the rest of us screamed at the top of our lungs for people to evacuate the first truck came we rushed to the airport I made my flight‚Äù Wei posted on Twitter.

On Thursday Uber‚Äôs CEO Dara Khosrowshahi also acknowledged Sam‚Äôs act of heroism on Twitter.

‚Äú‚ÄòI spoke to this Uber hero ‚Äì he was thankful that someone helped move his car ‚Äì all the while he was the one who ran into the building!‚Äù he posted.

Sam who‚Äôs a long-time Brooklyn resident and father of two said he has been driving with Uber since 2015.

He told CNN he‚Äôs glad everyone made it out safely and that his passenger was able to make her flight.

Authorities told CNN no one was injured in the fire and it‚Äôs currently under investigation.

Stephanie Fox a spokesperson with the Red Cross told CNN the organization is currently helping 11 residents who were impacted by the fire get back on their feet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3RyYWN0aWZ5LmNvbS9wL3ViZXItZHJpdmVyLXBpY2tzLXVwLXRoYXQtZXjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Driver Shocked After Picking up Her Ex Dashcam Records the Whole Thing in Viral TikTok,"Home > Viral News > Trending Uber Driver Shocked After Picking up Her Ex Dashcam Records the Whole Thing in Viral TikTok By Mustafa Gatollari Aug. 20 2022 Published 10:42 a.m. ET Source: Getty

It's common for Uber drivers to install dash cams that record both on-the-road and in-car for liability purposes. These recordings can come in quite handy if let's say you get in an accident or if a customer tries to contest a cleaning fee after they puked all over your vehicle.

For TikTok user @gbabeey it's also pretty darn useful in providing content that helped her go viral on the popular social media platform which is exactly what happened when she discovered that she was picking up ""THAT EX"" by chance when she was driving for the ride-sharing application.

Article continues below advertisement

In a series of clips she uploaded to the popular social media platform she documents her ride with an ex of hers and judging from the text overlay in the initial video this was a person she had some significant history with. The video begins with her pulling up to the pick-up spot. She gives a short wave and there's a text overlay that reads ""The moment I recognize him.""

She calmly rests her chin on her hand and then three passengers enter the car. One man gets into the front seat who has his face blurred out. Two other men enter the backseat. The second man who is seated behind her is her ex-boyfriend she puts a devil emoji head over his face in the video to protect his identity.

The passenger in the front apologizes for what sounds like not being at the correct location where she was set to pick them up and then he asks if it's possible to add another address for his friend (the ex) in the back because he needs to ""swing by"" another spot at the end of their ride.

In a follow-up clip they start discussing adding an address. She adds a follow-up text ""Not me hoping he didn't recognize me and trying to play it off."" The man in the back asks her ""How you doing this evening?"" The TikToker wonders in a text overlay ""Does he know who I am??""

He then asks her if she's ""mad"" that they asked her to drop them off at a different address before asking what her name is. She tells him ""Lydia"" then looks into the back seat and begins to act like she's just recognizing who he is. ""And this is where my ANXIETY took over"" she writes in another overlay. ""Lydia. Lydia"" the man says. The passenger in the front asks ""What happened?""

""I was soo nervous"" she writes. ""Oh my God don't don't crash the car"" the man in the front seat jokes as the passenger in the back and the TikToker begin laughing. Her ex leans into the front seat ""Please don't do that. You're gonna make me crash"" she says as she laughs and focuses her attention on the road. ""Lydia!"" he says again she responds ""Bret!"" It's at this moment that the passenger realizes what's going on and that the two of them have history with one another.

He asks ""Do you need me to be quiet?"" ""No! You are fine"" she says as the three of them in the car continue to laugh. Her ex and the friend in the front passenger seat begin talking to one another as Lydia sits there smiling. She covers her face as her ex leans into the front again ""Stop!"" she says jokingly. ""Ok"" the ex says and he reclines back into his seat.

""Are you drunk?"" she asks him? ""No! Not at all!"" he exclaims. In the fourth video she writes ""Literally screaming on the inside."" ""How've you been?"" he asks. ""Good. I've been good. You?"" ""I'm OK. It's good seeing you"" he says. ""Likewise"" she responds. Her friend chimes in breaking the tension ""I feel really good now that we all know each other."" Lydia and Bret agree as the three of them continue to drive

At this point in the conversation it seems that there's some confusion as to where they're going and she asks if he added the extra stop in the application. The passenger in the front says that he didn't but he'll add it in cash as a tip at the end of the ride. Her ex then cranes his next to the middle of the car and tells her that he's happy to see her. ""Are you?"" she asks. She then tells him that she just bought a house and he congratulates her and then he asks about her daughter.

She informs him that she's attending college and then after exchanging some more pleasantries he asks if he can have a hug. At this point they stop off at their second stop and she agrees. She goes to get out of the car. ""It's been too long"" he says. ""Give me my f**king hug"" he says as the two of them get out of the car and they embrace.

""I've been driving Uber long enough to know that this s**t was bound to happen sooner or later"" she says. She tries to break away and he asks for another hug which she obliges. He then asks if the two of them can go across the street so they can talk as the front passenger is waiting in the car. He says ""I'm so madly confused.""

She then shuts the door to the car ""They shut the door?!"" the front passenger asks and him and the third passenger start laughing. He then quips that they're going to go and get coffee and the two laugh again as another text overlay reads ""The conversation when we left the car tho!""

""I gotta tella you my d**k was tingling the vibes"" the man says as the two laugh some more. He goes on to call his friend ""a ho"" and they talk about how he knows ""everybody"" which at least one commenter remarked was a red flag. It's at this moment that the man in the backseat saw that she was recording in the car and he jokes ""Forget what I said guys but I know it's true"" which he then follows up with a laugh.

The friends sit in the car alone for a few minutes while Lydia and Bret who are outside of the car continue with their discussion. Towards the even of the ""Part 7"" clip she uploaded the two return back to the car when the other passenger in the back tells her that Bret said as soon as she rolled up that he knew who she was.

His friend in the backseat repeats ""This motherfu***r knows everybody"" to which Bret responds ""I do not!"" ""You a f***ing ho"" his friend says ""Stop telling lies"" Bret says. She then gets back in the driver's seat puts on her seatbelt and asks if she's following directions. They then talk about their respective kids and she adds that she adopted a boy who is now 17 years old.

She says in the eighth video of her documenting her chance Uber ride with an ex that she started driving part-time for the ride-share service in 2016 and that she ""knew at some point"" she was going to run into him. She said that she's come across people she ""absolutely did not like"" in the past and then he asks if he's one of those people to which she replies ""absolutely not"" and that she would've ""canceled the ride if that was the case.""

He asks if she knew it was him when he pulled up to which she lies and tells him she didn't (which Lydia admits in a text overlay). ""I looked at you and was like 'That ain't him'"" which she follows up with ""that ain't him.""

He says that he knew it was her ""instantly"" and said he could tell by her cheeks. ""Immediately I was like 'Oh my God!'"" She tells him that she doesn't look the same which he responds that he does. The further they talk she says it's been about ""20 years"" since they've seen each other before the ride.

The front passenger driver says ""You look great"" she replies with ""How do you know?"" everyone in the car laughs and he says ""from what I'm seeing"" that she looks good. In the tenth video her ex can be heard saying repeatedly that she's ""great people"" and goes onto explain that she's met members of his family.

They then talk about their parents for a bit before she says that she wasn't planning on going out to drive again tonight. Her ex goes on to say ""I don't know what brought you out tonight...if it's God or..."" at this point Lydia smiles as one of his friends says ""Amen brother."" He ex adds ""But I'm glad."" ""Oh my God"" she says.

He then asks her if she's still going to go the gym and she says between her day job and Uber sometimes she'll pull in full 24 hour work shifts without rest. After saying that she has a full health club including a squat rack at her house he asks if she needs some help getting back to working out and that ""maybe"" he might be able to find someone to do that. She smiles. There's a few seconds pause and his friend up front remarks ""Let me get up out the car"" to which everyone laughs.

She then gets into when the two of them met which was in 2005. The friend in the front passenger seat then asks if she can wait for them for like an ""hour or two"" and when she checks her phone she sees that they added the second stop incorrectly in the application.

When her ex leans forward she writes in a text overlay that she was ""blushing"" and remarks that he's just looking at ""how old"" she is. He then tells her she's ""beautiful."" She then says ""You know what I remember about you? And I'll never forget this s**t no matter how old I get you will always be older."" He then says that he never said that but she writes in a text overlay that he most certainly did. ""Swear to God that s**t stuck with me-""

He cuts her off and says ""Maybe I was just full of s**t!"" ""You think?"" she says giving him a look. ""That too I will never forget that s**t and I will never forget no matter how old I get you will always be older."" ""You know what I am so sorry"" he says.

She explains that they had stopped at the third friend's house to pick him up but the way she edited the videos made it look like the two of them just left the other passengers hanging in the whip. He said that he was glad he ran into her because he had been ""weighing heavy on his heart"" and that he wanted to ""make amends"" and he wanted to ""make it up to [her] somehow.""

She told him that amends weren't ""necessary"" and he didn't need to do anything of the sort. ""He just kept apologizing over and over again"" Lydia went on ""and how he felt like a piece of s**t.""

In other videos on her account she stated that she didn't intend on ""outing"" her ex or expose his identity but was going to be as ""brutally honest"" as she could about the nature of their relationship. In a continuation of her story time she said that the two of them met when they were in their late '20s and he was ""25 26 something like that.""

She said that she met him after she was getting out of active duty in the Army and getting out of a serious relationship and like her ex her other partner had cheated on her and got someone pregnant. Lydia said when they first met outside of a club he tried to kiss her and asked her out on a coffee date but at the time she didn't drink coffee. He suggested they have a gym date because she was ""heavy into the gym"" at the time.

Mary Dillon one of only 31 women leading a S&P 500 company before stepping down as the top executive at Ulta early last year will take over at Foot Locker for Richard Johnson who retires next month.

Shares of Foot Locker jumped 20 per cent to USD38.38 on Friday.

Dillon takes control of the company next month with Foot Locker relying less on sales at malls where foot traffic has plummeted and moving away from one of its most dominant suppliers Nike. Nike recently shifted aggressively to direct sales to customers.

Johnson who has led the company since 2014 will continue as the board‚Äôs executive chairman through 2023.

Ulta‚Äôs market capitalisation tripled under Dillon between 2013 to 2021 and doubled its number of stores and loyalty memberships. She created a partnership to get Ulta into a major retail chain and in front of potential customers who may have been unfamiliar with the brand.

Foot Locker posted its highest annual sales since 1994 in its last fiscal year as the pandemic eased potentially providing momentum as it expands its online sales platforms while opening more stand-alone locations. Foot Locker said it will maintain a presence in malls where their referee-striped sales force has been ubiquitous for decades.

It is diversifying the products customers see on shelves. Foot Locker said by the fourth quarter of this year it expects no vendor to make up more than 55 per cent of its product budget. Just two years ago Nike products accounted for as much as 75 per cent of Foot Locker‚Äôs product spending.

With Dillon‚Äôs arrival it‚Äôs also diversified its leadership. When Dillon stepped down at Ulta in March 2021 the number of top female executives in the S&P 500 dropped to 30 or about six per cent according to The Conference Board and its data provider Esgauge. That number remains low and a woman holding the top job in any publicly traded company is uncommon.

Dillon has served as the CEO of United States (US) Cellular and held executive and leadership positions at McDonald‚Äôs and PepsiCo.

Foot Locker also posted strong second-quarter profits on Friday that easily topped Wall Street expectations. The company has 2800 stores across 28 countries and reported USD9 billion in sales last year. During the second quarter it opened 34 new stores remodelled or relocated 24 more and closed 50.

It also owns over 500 Champs Sports stores and purchased West Coast shoe and athletic apparel retailer WSS in 2021 for USD750 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvbWFuc2RheS5jb20vc3R5bGUvYmVhdXR5L2E0MDg5ODM5MS9rYXRlLXdhbHNoLXNraW5jYXJlLXJvdXRpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kate Walsh 54 Shares Her Skincare Routine and Go-to Products,"Every item on this page was chosen by a Woman's Day editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.

Whether she's playing an American abroad in Emily in Paris or bringing back her character Addison Montgomery on Grey's Anatomy Kate Walsh always looks fabulous. So when we had the opportunity we asked the actress to share her skincare routine ‚Äî as well as her go-to workouts (weights and circuit training Pilates ballet walking) and self-care practices (meditation hanging out with her pets being in nature).

""I tend to have dry skin so I've always been mad about hydration using body oils and creams"" Walsh tells Woman's Day. She uses as a base for her face as well as . For her body she uses to address crepey skin. ""It's really incredible because it targets that specific symptom as opposed to just hydrating"" says Walsh who was recently named a celebrity ambassador for the brand along with fellow actress Jane Seymour.

When it comes to budget-friendly skincare products in her regimen she loves the ""super affordable"" ($15). ""I use it in conjunction with any kind of serum oil or cream for my face particularly to lock in the moisture."" She calls the ($29) ""magical"" for her dry skin in summer or winter. ""It's all about hydration"" the star stresses. ""I'm a big fan of basic and keeping it simple and that you don't have to spend a fortune on things to keep your skin hydrated and healthy and looking good.""

When asked to share the biggest lesson she's learned since turning 50 the 54-year-old says that by embracing change for her ""life gets better and better; I get more conscious and wiser.""

""This idea that we're supposed to stay the same or stay how we were when we were 20 to when we're 30 when we're 40 when we're 50 ‚Äî that's just a fallacy."" Walsh stresses the importance of listening to what's going on with your body and making changes when needed ""whether it's skincare or haircare getting enough sleep or just the changes that happen or have happened physically [as you age].""

That's just one of the reasons she's partnered with  which she uses daily to combat dry eyes. ""It is something that's very common as we age. And just like the way I hydrate my skin and I take care of my hair and my body it's just this thing that I do for my eyes"" Walsh says.

Note: Always check with your doctor first before trying new eye drops.

She notes that ""no one really tells you what it's like to get older ‚Äî but it's pretty fabulous if you go with the flow and make the changes that you need to make to take care of yourself. Every challenge in many ways post-50 has also been a great gift. It's just more information on how to take better care of myself and how to live well.""

UPS is the largest package delivery company in the world but its fleet of brown trucks and the warehouses where they're loaded are almost all operating without air conditioning. Nearly all UPS workers almost 350000 people are covered by a union contract. The contract is the biggest in North America and expires next year. In negotiations ways to beat the heat will be a key issue.

""UPS hasn't been proactive at all on the topic of heat and that's going to have to change"" Sean M. O'Brien general president of the union said to NBC. ""By refusing to implement these safety measures the company is literally sending drivers out to die in the heat.""

Nicholas Gubell a UPS driver on Long Island told the New York Times he had a dangerous run-in with heat stroke and paramedics had to take him to the hospital. ""People are dropping like flies out here"" he added. ""It's very brutal.""

In a letter addressed to Marty Urquhart VP of Labor Relations for the Central Region of the United States Parcel Service the Teamster's union made some demands. The letter dated July 27 2022 asks for fans in every truck cooling neck towels water and ice in a consistent supply. As well as uniforms that breathe better in extreme heat.

Their requests are in direct response to rising reports of heat-related incidents. As reported by NBC News more than a dozen reports from employees and union leaders say that workers are getting sick being hospitalized and even dying because of the heat. As a result they're asking for safety measures to be put in place at the highest level.

""Left and right people are falling out"" Jeff Schenfeld a union steward in Dallas and UPS employee of 25 years told NBC News. ""Something is different this year. It's a lot more people.""

In a tweet shared by Teamsters for a Democratic Union drivers posted pictures of thermometers inside trucks reaching 121F.

""UPS CEOs would never accept working in 120- or 130-degree offices. Drivers shouldn't either"" the tweet said.

In a statement emailed to PEOPLE UPS said they made plans to ""support employee safety and comfort on the job"" in preparation for the heat wave this summer. Their measures included ""providing additional water ice electrolyte replacement beverages and fruits with high water content."" They also put plans in motion to distribute 260000 new uniforms with ""wicking dry-fit shirts and performance fabric shorts"" as well as ""making cooling towels available.""

The statement said that UPS has also been ""accelerating the installation of fans in UPS vehicles across the country.""

""UPS trains employees to work safely throughout the year focusing on the importance of proper rest hydration nutrition and other good health practices"" said spokesperson Matt O'Connor. ""We have meetings with our employees all year round and when warranted remind them of forecasted temperatures signs and symptoms of heat illness and to be aware of their own health conditions.""

The New York Times reported that government records filed with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) show an uptick in heat-related reports. Since 2015 more than 270 UPS and USPS drivers have been sicked from heat exposure with many cases resulting in hospitalization. Workers for other delivery companies including FedEx have made up dozens more similar reports. The Times also reported that Teamsters told them ""heat-related injuries illnesses and deaths among drivers are severely underreported.""

Earn United miles by flying

As you'd expect you can earn United miles by flying with the carrier or one of its partners. However how you earn United miles depends on several factors including the airline operating the flight how you booked the flight and your fare class. Let's take a closer look.

Flying on United

Over the years United has changed how you earn miles when flying on United-operated flights. Instead of earning based on miles flown you now earn MileagePlus miles based on your ticket's base price (minus taxes). You'll also earn additional miles if you have MileagePlus elite status ‚Äî the higher your status the more miles you earn.

Here's how many miles you'll earn per dollar spent based on your level of status:

General member : 5 miles.

: 5 miles. Premier Silver : 7 miles.

: 7 miles. Premier Gold : 8 miles.

: 8 miles. Premier Platinum : 9 miles.

: 9 miles. Premier 1K: 11 miles.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

Here's an example of how this works. If you buy a one-way United ticket from Chicago to Des Moines with a base fare of $210 and $30 in taxes you'll earn 1050 miles as a MileagePlus traveler without status. However if you're a top-tier Premier 1K member that earning jumps to 2310 miles.

Note that these earning rates apply even if you're booked into United's basic economy fare class.

United flights also count toward earning Premier status though the carrier changed this process significantly for the 2020 qualification year. Instead of earning status based on miles flown you'll now earn it based on how many Premier qualifying points (PQP) you earn or a combination of how many PQPs you earn and Premier qualifying flights (PQF) you take.

PQP is determined based on how much you spend on flights and PQF is based on the number of segments flown on United or its partner airlines.

Flying Star Alliance partners

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

You can earn United MileagePlus miles when flying any of United's Star Alliance or non-alliance partners ‚Äî but it can be a little tricky.

Suppose you book a partner flight through United with a United Airlines ticket number. In that case you'll earn miles the same as if you were flying on a United-operated flight: based on the base fare of your ticket and your elite status level (as detailed above). However if you book the ticket on a partner ticket stock you'll earn miles based on your fare class and how long your flight is.

Fares are usually booked on a partner ticket stock when you book directly through the partner airline. For example if you're flying on Lufthansa and booked on Lufthansa.com you're almost definitely booked on Lufthansa ticket stock. If you book through an online travel agency (OTA) like Orbitz or a credit card portal like the Chase Ultimate Rewards Travel Portal or Amex Travel these methods may book you on partner ticket stock.

You can verify that a ticket was booked on partner ticket stock by looking at the e-ticket issued after booking. If the ticket number starts with 016 it's on United ticket stock.

The mileage earning rates vary from airline to airline. So check your booking class by looking at your ticket or calling the airline. Then head over to United's list of partner airlines click on your airline and find the corresponding fare class on that list.

To figure out how many miles you'll earn just multiply the mileage flown by the percentage in the ""Award mile earnings"" column. As you'd expect fares booked in premium cabins generally earn more miles than economy tickets.

United elite status on partner flights

One of the best ways to qualify for United Premier status is by flying on long-haul premium-cabin Star Alliance tickets. As mentioned you generally earn around 1 PQP per dollar spent on United flights. However on partner airlines you can sometimes earn over 3 PQPs for each dollar you spend.

Refer to our guide on earning PQPs with partner flights to learn how flying on United's partners can help you qualify for United status. Just keep in mind that United requires at least four paid flights per year to be on United or United Express to qualify for any status level.

On tickets ticketed and operated by Air Canada ANA Austrian Azul Brussels Lufthansa and SWISS Premier members earn bonus miles (but no bonus PQPs):

Premier Silver : 25% bonus.

: 25% bonus. Premier Gold: 50% bonus.

50% bonus. Premier Platinum : 75% bonus.

: 75% bonus. Premier 1K: 100% bonus.

Let's unpack this by looking at a real example on a Lufthansa ticketed and operated flight. We'll start with United's earning chart for Lufthansa.

(Screenshot from united.com)

Let's say you're flying from New York to Munich. Your flight is booked in Z-fare business class meaning that you'd earn 150% of the mileage flown as per the earning chart above. The flight from New York to Munich clocks in at 4038 miles so you'd earn 6057 redeemable miles. The math looks like this: 4038 * 1.50 = 6057.

As noted above a United Premier Gold member would earn an additional 50% of miles flown giving them 9086 miles for this example. Here's the math: (4038 * 1.50) * 1.50 = 9085.5 which would round up to 9086.

To determine the distance between two airports use GCmap.com and input your departure and arrival airport codes. It'll then tell you how far apart the two are in miles.

Transfer Ultimate Rewards points to United

Chase Ultimate Rewards is a popular transferable point currency. Although there are many ways to redeem Ultimate Rewards points the most lucrative is to transfer points to one of Chase's airline or hotel transfer partners.

United is one of Chase's airline transfer partners. So you can transfer Chase points to United at a 1:1 ratio effectively turning 1000 Ultimate Rewards points into 1000 United miles. Ultimate Rewards has various other transfer partners including Air France-KLM Flying Blue British Airways Avios and World of Hyatt. This added flexibility is why we recommend earning Ultimate Rewards points over United miles.

Chase's suite of Ultimate Rewards-earning credit cards may be a better fit for your wallet. They have broader bonus categories than United's cobranded cards. So even if you only plan on transferring your points to United there's a good chance you'll come out ahead with an Ultimate Rewards card.

Here are some of our favorite Ultimate Rewards-earning credit cards that you may want to add to your wallet.

Chase Sapphire Preferred Card

Annual fee: $95.

Sign-up bonus: Earn 75000 bonus points after you spend $4000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.

The only downside to getting an Ultimate Rewards credit card over a United cobranded card is the benefits; these cards don't offer free checked bags priority boarding or other United benefits. The Sapphire Reserve does offer other travel benefits like a Priority Pass Select membership. Still United flyers may not find it as valuable as a United Club membership on domestic flights.

Earn United miles with Marriott Bonvoy credit cards

One of the Marriott Bonvoy program's best perks is that you can transfer Marriott points to the program's many airline transfer partners. You can transfer Marriott points to most airline partners at a 3:1 ratio meaning three Marriott points equal one airline mile. Plus you'll get a 5000-mile bonus for every 60000 Marriott points you transfer.

United has a preferred transfer rate due to the airline's RewardsPlus partnership with Marriott. As of the time of writing Marriott points transfer to United MileagePlus at a 3:1.1 ratio. This is in addition to the 5000-mile bonus we mentioned earlier so transferring 60000 Marriott points to United results in 27000 United miles.

Related: When does it make sense to transfer Marriott points to airlines?

To transfer Marriott points to United log into your Marriott Bonvoy account head to the Transfer Points to Miles page and click the Transfer Points button at the center of the screen. Then select United from the airline drop-down menu enter your United MileagePlus number and enter how many points you'd like to transfer. Click the Continue button at the bottom of the window to initiate the transfer and the miles will appear in your United account within 48 hours.

Earn United miles with travel partners

Beyond airlines United has a handful of other travel partners like cruise lines hotels and rental car companies. Here's a quick look at all some of these partners and how to earn with them.

MileagePlus cruise portal

The MileagePlus cruise portal lets you earn and redeem United miles for booking a cruise.

While the earn and redemption rates vary you can typically get around 0.6 cents per mile. This is significantly less than the 1.4 cents TPG values United miles. So you're better off using the booking portal to earn United miles on your cruise. It's not unusual to earn up to 45000 bonus miles per booking even on low-cost cruises.

Booking hotels with United partners

United has a suite of hotel partners too. You can earn miles based on your hotel stay costs using the United Hotels portal RocketMiles and Points Hound. Each of these online travel agencies (OTAs) lets you book and pay through their website to earn miles on your hotel stays.

Unfortunately you won't earn hotel points or get hotel elite status benefits when booking through these portals. We only recommend booking independent hotels and stays at hotels where you otherwise wouldn't earn rewards. Further always make sure to compare the cost of the stay with booking directly.

United also has a partnership with Villas of Distinction where you can earn 3 miles per dollar on luxury vacation villas.

You can also earn United miles when you book directly with a handful of United's travel hotel partners. Sometimes this means you'll earn based on the price of your hotel stay. Other times it means transferring points from a hotel program to United MileagePlus.

Here's a look at how many miles you can earn:

Hotel Earning rate Accor Live Limitless Points transfer at a 2000:1000 ratio. Choice Privileges Earn 250 miles per stay. Points transfer at a 5000:1000 ratio. World of Hyatt Earn 500 miles per stay. Points transfer a 2.5:1 ratio. Plus receive a 5000-mile bonus when you convert 50000 points into 20000 miles. Hilton Honors Points transfer at a 10000:1000 ratio. IHG One Rewards Earn up to 2 miles per dollar depending on the property. Points transfer at 10000:2000 ratio. Marriott Bonvoy Earn up to 2 miles per dollar depending on the property. Points transfer at a 3:1.1 ratio with a 5000-mile bonus awarded for every 60000 transferred. You can also visit united.com/MarriottBonus to earn 500 miles on Marriott stays that link with your United flights. Marriott Vacation Club Vacation Club points transfer at a 500:8000 ratio. Up to 40000 miles per member per year. Radisson Rewards Points transfer at a 2000:200 ratio. Shangri-La Gold Circle Earn 500 miles per stay. Points transfer at a 2500:2500 ratio. Wyndham Rewards Earn up to 2 miles per dollar depending on the status level. Points transfer at a 6000:1200 ratio.

Rental car partners

: 750 miles. Premier Silver and Gold members : 1000 miles.

: 1000 miles. Premier Platinum and Premier 1K members: 1250 miles.

United packages

United also offers vacation packages where you can book a flight and hotel; flight and car; or a flight hotel and car. Priceline powers this service. When I ran a seven-night flight hotel and car package search from San Francisco to Los Angeles it clocked in at just under $2000 with a compact car from Budget and a standard king room at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel.

By booking a package I'd get two free rental car days and 1000 bonus miles as a limited-time offer.

Earn United miles with other partnerships

While flying and using cobranded credit cards are the primary methods to earn United miles quickly there are also many non-travel-related MileagePlus partners. Here are some of our favorites to help you earn extra United miles.

MileagePlus Shopping

Like most airlines United operates an online shopping portal (MileagePlus Shopping) where you can earn miles for making everyday purchases online. Just sign up for an account and find your merchant on the site before making a purchase.

Starting at this portal rather than the specific retailer's site will give you extra miles on your purchases in addition to the rewards you'll earn using your credit card of choice. This can be a great way to earn 1 2 or even 5 additional miles when shopping online.

In addition MileagePlus Shopping frequently runs holiday and seasonal promotions. Keep an eye out for these promotions and use them to earn even more on your online purchases.

However we recommend using a shopping portal aggregator like Cash Back Monitor to see which portal offers the best return on your purchases.

MileagePlus X app

Download the MileagePlus X app to earn United miles on the go. Simply put you use the app to buy gift cards to select merchants. The gift card is available immediately and you can purchase it in any amount. When making a MileagePlus X purchase you'll earn a select number of miles per dollar.

Participating merchants include major brands like Walmart Staples and Panera Bread. Be sure to give it a look before you make your next purchase. One of the best things about the MileagePlus X app is that miles are awarded instantly in most cases. So if you're ever a few miles away from a redemption buy a gift card to a store or restaurant you frequent.

Best of all primary United Chase Cardmembers earn a 25% bonus on miles earned from MileagePlus on eGift Card purchases.

United MileagePlus Dining

Like most other domestic carriers United has a dining rewards program that's part of Rewards Network: MileagePlus Dining.

In short this is a shopping portal for eating out. Just sign up for an account and link the credit cards you use for dining. You'll earn up to 5 miles per dollar when you swipe a linked card at participating restaurants. These earnings are in addition to what you earn on the credit card you use so be sure to use one that offers a category bonus on dining purchases.

To maximize your earnings with MileagePlus Dining you'll want to get select status and try to snag VIP status. Becoming a select member is easy: sign up for the program and enable email alerts. Doing so will get you an earning rate of 3 miles per dollar.

Once you've made 11 dining purchases in twelve months you'll reach VIP status and start taking home 5 miles per dollar. If you don't opt in to receive emails from MileagePlus Dining you're considered a basic member (and will only earn 1 mile per $2 spent).

United's PerksPlus program lets businesses earn rewards on employee travel. Sign up for the program and you'll be issued a PerksPlus number that you your employees and your travel agent can add to work-sponsored travel operated by United All Nippon Airways (ANA) Austrian Airlines Brussels Airlines Lufthansa and SWISS. Your business will earn PerksPlus points based on the cost of a ticket.

You can redeem these points for United elite status for employees award travel certificates United Club memberships and more. You can use these to reduce employee travel costs or enhance your travel experience. PerksPlus points are earned in addition to the miles an employee earns when traveling so both parties win. Check out United's PerksPlus website to learn more and enroll.

Buy United miles

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

If you need United miles in a pinch you can opt to buy them from the airline. Unfortunately however it's usually quite expensive to do this. The standard price for United miles is well over 2 cents per mile which is rarely worth it unless you need to buy a small number of miles to top up for an award.

United frequently runs mileage sales that drop the cost of miles considerably. Even so you should only buy miles when you have a specific redemption in mind and have already found bookable award space. Be sure to compare the cost of an award ticket against the cash fare before booking with miles.

Bottom line

As you can see there are many ways you can earn United miles. The most robust approach is to use the above methods in tandem. If you use all of the discussed earning methods at once you'll unlock some terrific earning rates that will quickly get you within striking distance of your next award trip.

We recommend starting with a credit card to earn United miles on everyday purchases and then moving on to the other methods discussed. This will ensure you're leaving no miles on the table when you book travel and make everyday purchases.

In 2017 there were police raids due to drugs and anti-social behaviour. Then in 2019 flashing blue lights of police vans lit up Oxford Street Rutland Street and Stanley Street as officers tried to contain unrest which resulted in confrontations between locals and police.

It was these problems which prompted local man 62-year-old Billy Dasein ‚Äì who grew up in East Marsh and still lives there today ‚Äì to take action.

‚ÄúA community meeting was held‚Äù he explains ‚Äúand I wasn‚Äôt going to go but then my neighbour said ‚Äòour mums would have gone‚Äô so I did and that‚Äôs when I found myself speaking up.‚Äù It cemented his decision to continue the work of the community group he co-founded in 2017 ‚Äì East Marsh United.

Watch Vicky‚Äôs report from East Marsh below

The name was deliberately chosen because it sounds like a local football team and is a world away from the ‚Äúlevelling up‚Äù jargon often used in political discourse. It began as a weekly meeting of local people who took on social problems such as litter and fly tipping.

Five years on they have become a socially conscious ethical landlord. The group has begun to raise investment to buy up dilapidated homes in the area renovate them and rent them out to people at an affordable rate which is tied to the Local Housing Allowance (the mechanism through which housing benefit is calculated). So far they have three properties and are hoping to expand imminently.

Reverend Kay Jones of East Marsh United a Grimsby based community group

Poor housing is rife in East Marsh and in this part of England overall; there are more than 50000 households living in energy inefficient homes in north east Lincolnshire which means not only that poor insulation is causing mould and damp but that energy bills are high.

Walking around Rutland Street with Pete Rowley ‚Äì who runs the ethical building firm East Marsh Construction which works closely with East Marsh United aims to employ local people on fair wages to work on homes which need doing up ‚Äì it is easy to spot the homes which have been renovated.

‚ÄúWe put a new roof on that one‚Äù Mr Rowley points to a terraced house. ‚ÄúWhen we were brought in it was owned by a private landlord and there were six children living there. There was damp everywhere running down the walls.‚Äù

Caption: The East Marsh area of Grimsby was built in the 1800s to provide housing for railway contruction workers

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been deliberately focusing on the very worst homes some of which have been boarded up for eight or nine years‚Äù Mr Rowley adds as we walk around. ‚ÄúA big problem here is that landlords from out of town have bought up ‚Äòcheap‚Äô properties as investments which sometimes they‚Äôve never seen and they don‚Äôt care about the condition of them as long as they get their rent.‚Äù

The local Reverend Kay Jones who is also involved with East Marsh United confirms the scale of the problem. She said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been to one house where the floorboards were rotten and you had to jump over a hole to get in. These people have no choice they take that house or they‚Äôre homeless.‚Äù

‚ÄúEast Marsh United‚Äù Revd Jones adds ‚Äúis a response to a community that has never had a voice for itself.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt always like this. Grimsby itself including the area of East Marsh was once a thriving community. Mr Rowley is something of a historian in his spare time and explains that the terraced homes here are built on top of marshland which was drained to build homes for rail workers in the 1800s. After that they were home to the families of deep sea trawler workers when Grimsby was one of the biggest fishing docks in the world.

Mark Hodson a local architect who works with community group East Marsh United based in Grimsby

‚ÄúThere was work‚Äù Mr Dasein says of his community‚Äôs past. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt well-paid and I suppose you‚Äôd call it ‚Äòzero hours‚Äô today but you could walk out of one job and into another easily. There were opportunities here.‚Äù

Today though according to the local council‚Äôs Director of Public Health‚Äôs annual report East Marsh is in the top 1 per cent of most deprived wards in England. And earlier this year there were three people chasing every job vacancy.

The contemporary challenges faced by the people of Grimsby ‚Äì caused by the decline of the town‚Äôs fishing industry following the 70s Cod Wars and a lack of investment for essential infrastructure such as roads ‚Äì are often highlighted by politicians. In the last year former Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and his shadow Levelling Up secretary Lisa Nandy have all paid flying visits ‚Äì but the need for decent housing is rarely mentioned.

The group‚Äôs focus on homes then is no accident. Mr Dasein Mr Rowley Revd Jones and their colleague local architect 59-year-old Mark Hodson are all sceptical about the government‚Äôs ‚ÄúLevelling Up‚Äù agenda.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of jargon that gets used after people come to East Marsh‚Äù Mr Hodson who was born on the East Marsh Estate and grew up locally says ‚Äúbut safe housing and finding somewhere decent to live needs to be a key aspect of any ‚Äúlevelling up‚Äù agenda.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was almost inevitable that something like the riots in 2017 happened‚Äù Mr Hodson says when we meet at the Shalom Community Centre with Mr Rowley. ‚ÄúWe needed an organisation like East Marsh United to take back some form of control. We needed to directly respond to absent landlords who don‚Äôt care about their properties or the tenants in them.‚Äù

Mr Dasein agrees. ‚ÄúI joke that people talk about the community at East Marsh as though we‚Äôre from another planet ‚Äì East Martians‚Äù he jokes. ‚ÄúBut people here need the same basic things as people everywhere.‚Äù

i‚Äôs Housing Correspondent Vicky Spratt in the East Marsh area of Grimsby

‚ÄúI talk about the ‚Äòbroken window theory‚Äô a lot‚Äù adds Mr Dasein. The premise of this idea which came to prominence in sociology in the 1980s is simple: if left unattended seemingly small issues like broken windows litter or boarded up homes contribute to an overall sense of disorder and disenfranchisement in a community.

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt look after the smaller infractions on a street then it‚Äôs going to escalate to bigger things because it says ‚Äònobody cares there is nobody looking after our place‚Äô‚Äù Mr Dasein explains. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about that little word that means so much ‚Äì home.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are not buying houses as an investment tool which is how they‚Äôve been treated here and in other places unfortunately‚Äù Mr Dasein continues. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre buying them to be homes for our people.‚Äù

Before I leave East Marsh I bump into a young man ‚Äì Terry ‚Äì and his partner who are currently renting their home from East Marsh United.

He smiles enthusiastically when I ask him what living in one of their properties is like: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre absolutely brilliant. If something needs to be done they do it. They‚Äôre not one of these landlords who are afraid to spend money. They respect their tenants. They‚Äôre not jumping down your throat if you‚Äôre going to be a few days late on the rent. They work with you.‚Äù

As politicians in Westminster grapple with regional inequality talk of ‚Äúlevelling up‚Äù is the latest in a long line of buzzwords from former Conservative chancellor George Osborne‚Äôs ‚ÄúNorthern Powerhouse‚Äù to media commentators‚Äô use of the ‚ÄúLeft Behind‚Äù to describe people from places such as Grimsby who voted to leave the European Union. But East Marsh United wants to keep things simple.

East Marsh United‚Äôs vision is ‚Äúa hundred houses for a hundred years‚Äù. This would create a sustainable revenue stream via rental income to keep the organisation going. As things stand they have raised half of the ¬£500000 they need in a community share offer to fund another 10 homes. For every ¬£100000 invested the chairman of Grimsby Town FC Jason Stockwood has pledged to invest ¬£10000.

They could well be onto something. Recent analysis by Pro Bono Economics has shown that the presence of community assets ‚Äì that is things which are for and owned by local people ‚Äì might be a better predictor of life satisfaction in an area than its GDP or average household income.

There is a photograph that Mr Dasein likes to show when he is giving presentations about East Marsh United‚Äôs work: it shows him on the doorstep of his family home as a baby.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no litter in the photo and you can see that people have put plant pots outside their homes on the pavement but this is something that you just could not do today because they‚Äôd be trashed‚Äù Mr Dasein says. ‚ÄúPeople just want a nice house nice neighbours and enough money to get by. That‚Äôs the point.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,

How much of Nevada‚Äôs land is owned by the feds? More than you might think

Those wolves that were seen in Nevada? They weren‚Äôt wolves

Nevada has the highest percentage of one-star acute-care hospitals of any state the lowest rating given by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

The state has a single five-star hospital Renown South Meadows Medical Center in Reno placing Nevada 12th worst for percentage of top-rated facilities according to a data analysis by the Review-Journal.

The rating system is intended to capture the quality of care by measuring death rate safety of care readmission patient experience and timely and effective care a Medicare spokesperson said.

Six of the 14 major acute-care hospitals in the Las Vegas metropolitan area were given a single star in the annual ratings published by the federal agency in late July.

‚ÄúThe fact that we have so many one-star hospitals means we have a lot of work to do‚Äù Dr. Marc Kahn dean of the Kirk Kerkorian School of Medicine at UNLV said on Thursday.

The highest rating for a Las Vegas metro hospital was three stars given to four hospitals out of the area‚Äôs 14.

The ratings do not ‚Äúnecessarily indicate the public should avoid certain facilities or travel outside of their immediate area to receive care‚Äù the Medicare spokesperson said in an email. Instead they provide information for consumers to weigh in their decision-making.

Nationally the one-star category has the fewest number of hospitals with 174. There are 627 with two stars 793 with three 766 with four and 385 with five.

The Review-Journal‚Äôs analysis excluded military hospitals and Washington D.C. which has just six hospitals three of which are rated as one-star.

An imperfect system

Las Vegas-area hospitals as well as national and state hospital associations emphasized that the star ranking system has its limitations.

‚ÄúThe Star Rating system does not accurately reflect the world-class care delivered by our team members across UMC‚Äù said Scott Kerbs a representative of county hospital University Medical Center which received a one-star rating.

‚ÄúAs Nevada‚Äôs only Level I Trauma Center Verified Burn Center and Transplant Center UMC cares for many of our community‚Äôs most critically ill and injured patients but unfortunately the Star Rating system does not account for patient demographics the overall complexity of cases treated and UMC‚Äôs status as a safety net hospital‚Äù Kerbs wrote in an email.

A representative of the American Hospital Association stressed that the ratings may be affected by factors beyond the control of a hospital.

For example readmission to a hospital can occur because a patient receives inadequate recovery support after discharge which could include a lack of transportation to get to appointments or inadequate nutrition said Akin Demehin the hospital association‚Äôs senior director of policy.

Kahn noted that when discharged patients don‚Äôt have a primary care physician they may resort to using a hospital emergency room for care which may increase readmission rates. The medical school he said is playing a role in expanding the network of primary care physicians in the community.

Hospitals respond

A frequent criticism of hospital rating systems is that a hospital that receives a low grade from one system can receive accolades from another. Las Vegas hospitals echoed this sentiment.

‚ÄúWe are proud of our hardworking team members who have worked tirelessly to provide kind compassionate high-quality clinical care in our ERs nursing units and outpatient centers‚Äù said a representative of the Valley Health System three of whose hospitals received one star and three two stars. Valley Health System is affiliated with Universal Health Services.

‚ÄúThanks to their diligence and expertise we have received many recent quality-related accomplishments including awards from 2022-2023 US News and World Report in five different categories the Spring 2022 Leapfrog patient safety awards and earning accreditations from The Joint Commission and the American Heart Association in the areas of stroke and heart care‚Äù representative Gretchen Papez wrote in an email.

The Valley Health System‚Äôs Valley Spring Valley and Centennial Hills hospitals received one star.

‚ÄúWe recognize the importance of measuring and public reporting of quality performance and safety and we work diligently to continually improve‚Äù said Marissa Mussi a representative of Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center which was rated as one-star. She noted that Sunrise had been rated one of America‚Äôs 250 Best Hospitals in 2022 by Healthgrades among other distinctions.

The two other hospitals in the Sunrise Health System which is affiliated with Hospital Corporation of America received three stars: Southern Hills and MountainView.

Hospital representatives said that all information should be considered when evaluating hospitals noting too that some data is out-of-date.

‚ÄúWe trust many of the various grades and ratings that are posted throughout each year‚Äù St. Rose Dominican hospitals representative Gordon Absher said in an email. ‚ÄúHowever quality rating initiatives do not always accurately reflect our current performance or quality. Results often lag behind lengthy reporting processes and don‚Äôt necessarily reflect more recent improvement data.‚Äù

Two St. Rose campuses San Martin and de Lima received three stars. The Siena campus received one star.

Hospital representatives encouraged patients to take into account more than just data when evaluating a hospital.

‚ÄúWhen making health care decisions patients should use all available tools at their disposal such as talking with friends and family and consulting with doctors nurses and other health care providers‚Äù Marissa Brown director of workforce and clinical services for the Nevada Hospital Association said in a statement.

Important metrics

Kahn emphasized that the ratings are a useful tool for patients hospitals and communities. ‚ÄúHospitals need to take these ratings seriously‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMost of the metrics are important and they‚Äôre important for hospitals. So I think what we do is we use these to be better at what we do. ‚Ä¶ As a new medical school we see part of our responsibility as to improve the level of care that we provide our community.‚Äù

He continued ‚ÄúWe all need to work together to improve those things. That‚Äôs really what this is telling us.‚Äù

If you haven't subscribed yet you can do that by clicking here.

The current staffing crisis in health care has reignited debate over privatization of the Canadian system ‚Äî and while more needs to be done to take the pressure off hospitals critics say more private care is not a ""simple solution.""

This week Ontario Health Minister Sylvia Jones revealed a plan to help stabilize the province's health-care system that included increasing the number of publicly funded surgeries performed at existing private clinics though she declined to provide details on which specific facilities would be involved or which surgeries would be covered.

""Health care will continue to be provided to the people of Ontario through the use of your OHIP card"" she said at a news conference ‚Äã‚ÄãThursday declining to answer a question about whether she would consider allowing more private clinics in the province.

Depending on who you ask increased privatization is either a growing threat or a possible solution to the staffing crisis being felt across the country.

When asked about the role of private clinics recently Ontario Health Minister Sylvia Jones said that the public should not be afraid of 'innovation' in the health-care system. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)

Yet for-profit clinics for surgeries and other medical practices have existed to varying degrees across Canada for decades and commercial agencies have been quietly filling staffing shortages during the pandemic ‚Äî at a growing cost to hospitals and taxpayers.

Proponents argue some privatization would take pressure off the public system and better triage care while those opposed worry it would siphon off resources and increase inequity among Canadians.

""Right now we find ourselves in a really challenging situation because the health-care system is currently not functioning well ‚Äî and I think that's becoming more apparent day by day"" said Dr. Katharine Smart president of the Canadian Medical Association (CMA).

""Privatization always is one of the things that people bring up in that conversation"" she said. ""But I think what we really need to be considering is how would that actually improve service delivery for Canadians to suddenly have a private for-profit model?""

Private clinics aim to fill gaps in care

Canada is facing a critical shortage of family doctors  with millions of Canadians without access to primary care because of retiring physicians and fewer medical school grads choosing the specialty due to a lack of resources and high overhead costs.

The pandemic has also exacerbated a lack of access to emergency care and increased wait times for surgery with close to 600000 fewer surgeries performed between March 2020 and December 2021 compared to 2019 according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) .

Almost half of adults across Canada's 10 provinces had difficulty accessing health care in 2020 and 2021 while close to 15 per cent said they didn't receive the care they needed at all according to a 2021 survey from Statistics Canada.

WATCH | What's behind the shortage of family doctors in Canada?

What's behind the shortage of family doctors in Canada? Duration 6:53 Family physicians Dr. Kamila Premji and Dr. Rita McCracken discuss the shortage of family doctors in Canada and what can be done to ease the situation.

Private clinics have moved in to try to fill that gap in some provinces including Quebec and Nova Scotia . Others are pushing back against the notion of offering more private health care.

In British Columbia the province's highest court recently upheld a lower court's dismissal of a Vancouver surgeon 's challenge of the Medicare Protection Act ruling that bans on extra billing and private insurance do not violate charter rights.

As it stands Canada's health-care spending is divided between the public and private sector at roughly a 75-25 split and at a cost of about $6666 per Canadian according to CIHI . Private health-care services are paid for by patients primarily out of pocket as well as through private insurance.

The country was projected to spend more than $300 billion on health care in 2021 which represents nearly 13 per cent of the GDP. That puts Canada roughly on par with other wealthy countries . (The United States spends the most on health care of any country in the OECD.)

Dr. Adam Hofmann is owner of Algomed which has private clinics in Quebec and Nova Scotia where it charges clients a subscription fee of $22 per month out of pocket plus $20 per visit. Hofmann said while he was once a staunch defender of a publicly funded health-care system he now believes private clinics are part of the solution.

""A large number of patients that end up in the emergency room are there for conditions that can be treated or prevented in an outpatient primary care clinic"" he told CBC's The House . ""And these patients almost universally don't have access to primary care.""

These kinds of private options should be explored on a broader scale as Canada seeks to solve its health-care challenges said Janice MacKinnon a professor of public policy at the University of Saskatchewan and a former provincial finance minister.

""We have to do everything we can to make the system more effective more cost effective and more accessible to people"" she told The House adding that other countries particularly in Europe have developed models where both public and private systems can co-exist.

""No government is saying: We don't want to fix the public system we want to create a separate one. They're saying we need to fix the public system and we see private options as a way to do that.""

Privatization 'not a simple solution'

Colleen Flood a research chair in health law and policy and professor at the University of Ottawa has looked at health-care systems around the world and she says private care tends to make access more difficult for low-income residents.

Flood described privatization as a ""zombie solution"" that we ""pull out all the time instead of focusing on how to fix the public health-care system.""

""It's not a simple solution"" she said. ""Countries that have public-private systems they spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to regulate the private [sector] so that it doesn't absorb all the resources from the public health-care system.""

In general she explained private clinics tend to target less complicated procedures ‚Äî such as knee and hip surgeries ‚Äî but the public system is still relied upon for emergency services and complex treatments for conditions like cancer and heart disease.

""So you are diverting labour ‚Ä¶ not only to the relatively small percentage of the population that can pay for that or have private insurance"" she said ""but you're also diverting them from really important care.""

(Submitted by Colleen M. Flood)

Ontario's plan to fund private clinics with public money could potentially be a more efficient way to provide service depending on the cost which is ultimately footed by taxpayers said Maude Laberge a professor in health economics at Laval University in Quebec City.

""That's a negotiation aspect between the government and those clinics"" she said. ""As long as the patient doesn't have to pay.‚Ä¶ If a clinic can do something really well ‚Äî as well as it's done in the hospital or in the public ‚Äî then there's no problem with having such private specialized clinics. If the patient has to pay then it brings equity issues.""

Hiring staff from private temp agencies hasn't seemed to solve the crisis in Ontario where some hospitals have paid millions more to such firms to help staff intensive care units and emergency rooms at an hourly rate more than double that of unionized nurses as first reported by the Toronto Star this week.

""Where's the stewardship for our tax dollars?"" said Dr. Michael Warner critical care medical director at Toronto's Michael Garron Hospital. ""And then what is that money not being spent on because it's being spent on nurses?""

WATCH | Critics sound alarm over Ontario's reliance on private nursing agencies:

Critics raise alarms over Ontario‚Äôs reliance on private nurse agencies Duration 2:03 With a shortage of nurses in Ontario hospitals are increasingly relying on temporary agency nurses to help fill the gap. Critics are raising concerns that public dollars are going to these private agencies instead of toward better wages for nurses.

Toronto's University Health Network (UHN) spent just over $1 million to hire nurses from various agencies in 2018 ‚Äî but that increased to more than $6.7 million in 2022 alone more than $4 million of which was tied to hiring private nurses to work in its ICUs.

""What we've seen during COVID is that these agencies are charging much more and I'm not sure where their money is coming from but hospitals are paying much higher hourly rates"" said Warner. ""What they've done during the pandemic has been predatory and exploitative.""

Transforming the public system?

Those in favour of privatization say the Canadian health-care system desperately needs to be open to new ideas with Jones Ontario's health minister saying last week that Ontarians should not be afraid of ""innovation.""

But critics say there is little evidence to suggest the situation is improving with the private services we already have ‚Äîdespite costing considerably more ‚Äî or that more of it will help.

""While there may be ways to improve the system for sure with innovation ‚Ä¶ we have to be clear on what exactly that we're privatizing and how that's going to cost less and deliver better outcomes"" Warner said.

""It makes more sense to transform the public system than to nibble around the edges with private health care.""

The CMA's Smart said previous examples of private companies delivering health care in Canada ""skim off the easiest most simplistic"" areas and fall short of developing an ongoing meaningful relationship between the patient and doctor.

""It doesn't do anything for patients who have chronic and complex needs; it doesn't do anything for patients who may be having challenges because of social determinants of health"" she said. ""Those people are left behind for an under-resourced public system.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvaGVhbHRoL2ktdGhvdWdodC1pLW1pZ2h0LWRpZS1hdC1ob21lLWNhbmFkYS1zLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLXN5c3RlbS1pcy1jcnVtYmxpbmctZXhwZXJ0cy1zYXktMS42MDM2NjI40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'I thought I might die at home': Canada's health-care system is crumbling experts say,"For 36 hours Liz LeClair suffered through excruciating abdominal pain and vomiting in her home in Dartmouth N.S. with no ambulance coming to help.

Her ordeal is just one example of how Canada's health care system hugely overburdened and struggling amid worker shortages needs desperate attention experts say.

When LeClair was hit with escalating pain earlier this month she called the province's virtual health line.

""My signs and symptoms were symptomatic of possibly a bowel obstruction of some kind"" she told CTV News.

But she was told it would be nine hours before she could speak to a nurse.

She called 911 and waited more than two hours for an ambulance. None arrived.

Eventually she was told the wait to see an ER doctor was currently up to 16 hours.

So she did the only thing she could ‚Äî praying her symptoms would simply subside as family members cared for her at home.

Her experience is far from unique.

Across the country Canadians have been struggling with inflated wait times at hospitals closed emergency departments shrinking access to ambulances and long-term care among other impacts as the health-care system limps along.

Experts say that drastic action needs to be taken to aid health-care workers.

""We don't have enough doctors or nurses to be able to take care of all the Nova Scotians and Canadians that need access to care"" Dr. Leisha Hawker president of Doctors Nova Scotia told CTV News.

Doctors and nurses coast to coast are saying they can't keep up with the demand. Morale is at an all-time low according to Tim Guest president of the Canadians Nurses Association.

""I would say that nurses are exhausted they're burnt out they're demoralized"" he told CTV News.

In B.C. health experts cite burnout low pay and mental health challenges as reasons fewer ambulances are on the road.

In some parts there aren't any.

Troy Clifford president of Ambulance Paramedics of B.C. said a marked lack of ambulances is now happening ""every day of the week.""

""It's not just isolated to weekends and nights and that's really putting a strain on the system and affecting our patients"" he told CTV News.

In Ontario the provincial government recently announced that they would be expanding some surgeries into private clinics in an attempt to address backlogs a troubling move that experts are worried could lead to increased privatization as a way to avoid actually fixing the public health care system.

Ontario Nurses Assocation (ONA) president Cathryn Hoy said in a press release that shifts into privatization ""will only line the pockets of investors nothing more.""

She added: ""The evidence is clear: health-care privatization provides worse health outcomes to our patients and has much higher overhead costs which will be paid by taxpayers.""

Earlier this month ONA called for the province's Bill 124 to be repealed stating that its suppression of wages and benefits for nurses is exacerbating staffing shortages by making it impossible for nurses to support themselves.

In northern Manitoba at the hospital in Lynn Lake at least eight patients have been transferred more than eight hours away to Flin Flon because of staffing shortages forcing the closure of all long-term care beds.

Families were only given a 24-hour notice.

A sudden transfer like this means that many families won't be able to visit their loved ones according to Lynn Lake city councillor Victoria Phillips.

""There are a lot of families that live in the area that are senior may not drive that do not have the means to have their own personal vehicle so it's really causing a lot of heartache"" she said.

One of those eight patients died two weeks later.

""She definitely would have been alone"" Phillips said. ""I don't think her family would be able to get there in time.""

In a statement tonight the Canadian Medical Association president pointed to decades of disjointed and siloed decisions as reasons for the health-care system's current state.

He says he hopes to see tangible solutions in this week's meetings between the premiers of Ontario New Brunswick Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island to resolve this crisis.

A previous statement from CMA in July stated that increased federal funding was needed to address the complex interweaving issues.

""We encourage the federal government to swiftly meet with the provinces and territories to resolve funding issues and develop real solutions to address systemic challenges that require immediate action"" the July statement reads.

Fortunately for LeClair her symptoms did subside after more than a day of debilitating pain. But she's haunted by the idea that if things had gotten suddenly worse there might not have been help available.

""This was the first time that I ever thought that I might die at home"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Jlcm5pZS1zYW5kZXJzLXVpb25zLXJhbGx5LXBoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1sYWJvci1tb3ZlbWVudC0yMDIyMDgyMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'We are in the fight of our lifetimes' Bernie Sanders tells union partisans at Philly rally,"Bernie Sanders center takes the stage with Sara Nelson president of the Association of Flight Attendants and Sean O'Brien the national president of the Teamsters.

The Republic of Maldives has made remarkable socioeconomic progress during the past two decades and is now an upper middle-income country. Notable achievements have been made in the health sector particularly the increase in life expectancy improvement of infant child and maternal health control of communicable diseases including elimination of diseases such as malaria measles and lymphatic filariasis and high rates of immunization coverage.

Despite these triumphs the country continues to face new challenges such as growing rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) accounting for more than 80% of total deaths demand for better quality services heavy reliance on expatriate health professionals limited health access for the increasing migrant population and vulnerability to the impact of climate change.

With the high prevalence of Cancer in the country the Government of Maldives is currently working to establish a specialized hospital to provide comprehensive care for cancer patients. To address and overcome these hurdles WHO supported Ministry of Health with a team of local and international experts to review the NCD interventions in health services focusing on primary health care review the status of cancer prevention diagnosis management and monitoring develop a package of NCD services conceptualize and plan a service delivery model for integration develop a monitoring and evaluation system for PHC and lastly to propose a strategic plan for addressing cancer prevention early diagnosis management palliative care and cancer registries.



To plan the mission a series of meetings were held with the WHO South East Asia technical unit about these needs and the decision was made to conduct a situation assessment of current cancer care services (prevention treatment and diagnostic services) in the country. During their five-day mission the team of seven experts met with multiple partners and stakeholders including the relevant departments of Ministry of Health teams from government and private hospitals NGOs UN agencies and the Maldives National Defense Force. The team also had a field visit to an atoll where they inspected and observed service delivery at Regional and Atoll Hospitals and island health care facilities.



‚ÄúMaldives has made investments to equip primary health care with personnel medicines and equipment in each Island. These resources if optimally used can make a big difference in prevention and control of NCDs.‚Äù said Dr Cherian V. Varghese team lead of the mission and Regional Advisor for Noncommunicable Diseases WHO South East Asia ‚ÄúEstablishing standard treatment protocols and referral thresholds will help to get the most out of the health services and to reduce referrals and out of pocket expenditure. WHO will support this area through piloting PHC-integrated NCD services in one Atoll as a demonstration site for comprehensive NCD services.‚Äù



Cancer was identified as a priority and a functioning cancer registry and a national cancer programme are priorities. Planning for radiation safety and nuclear medicine should also start now. WHO and IAEA stands committed to support Maldives in advancing these areas.

To conclude the weeklong events the team prepared and presented their findings and recommendations to WHO Representative Dr Nazneen Anwar Minister of Health His Excellency Ahmed Naseem and senior officials from the Ministry of Health. The next steps include working with Ministry of Health key institutions and contributors to develop a detailed plan for Nuclear medicine services (radiation safety standards and guidelines) and a National Cancer Control Plan.



‚ÄúThis is the first step WHO has taken to integrate NCDs to primary health care in Maldives. This first step itself will be immensely beneficial to the country‚Äù said Dr Nazneen Anwar WHO Representative ‚ÄúIn addition WHO is pleased to extend support to the Government to control Cancer and introduce Nuclear medicine services; another first for the country.‚Äù



WHO is committed to utilize technical resources and high-level expertise to address and resolve public health burdens faced by Members States and to lead global efforts in expanding Universal Health Coverage.

It was reported that Himmler an animal lover and architect of the Nazis‚Äô ‚Äúfinal solution‚Äù was so appalled at the cruelty of the spectacle that he almost fainted.

Bullfighting then was in its heyday but now as it slides into an apparently unstoppable decline the question is what to do with Spain‚Äôs estimated 1700 bullrings most of which are in city centres.

The number of traditional bullfights fell from 648 in 2009 to 349 10 years later leaving many bullrings abandoned.

The fiesta nacional was also hard hit by the pandemic. A survey by the website Mundotoro suggests that within two years there will only be 261 localities where a torero can step out in the suit of lights compared with 900 in 2007. These days few toreros once as famous as rock stars are household names.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that it‚Äôs in decline but what the latest survey shows is that at least 8 million people in Spain still have a strong interest in bullfighting‚Äù says Vicente Royuela an economist at the University of Barcelona who published an analysis of a survey of the state of bullfighting carried out by the culture ministry in 2019.

‚ÄúOne reason for the decline is that fewer people live in the countryside and have any relationship with animals. Another factor as well as anti-bullfight sentiment among the young is that the tickets are expensive.‚Äù

He adds that while young people show little enthusiasm for la corrida they are a majority when it comes to village festivals that involve running with bulls or fiestas such as San Ferm√≠n in Pamplona.

There are also identity issues. For the far-right Vox party a love of bullfighting is synonymous with being Spanish.

‚ÄúHere in Catalonia being opposed to bullfights is a way of being anti-Spanish‚Äù Royuela says.

While many bullrings have fallen into disuse and disrepair some are being repurposed. The bullring in Benidorm which opened in 1962 is getting a ‚Ç¨8.6m (¬£7.3m) makeover as a cultural complex with a library rehearsal studios youth centre and a meeting point for community associations.

Bullfighting has been banned in the Canaries since 1991 and after years of wrangling the ring in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is to have a new life housing nightclubs apartments and a public square.

One of the great success stories is the Las Arenas bullring in Barcelona that opened in 1900 but was abandoned after its last bullfight in 1977.

After failed attempts by the local council to resuscitate the arena it was sold and reopened in 2011 as a shopping and leisure centre designed by the British architect Richard Rogers along with his Catalan partner Alonso Balaguer architects.

As the mudejar-style building is listed the entire facade had to be preserved and in a feat of engineering was raised on to pillars to improve access.

It took six years to complete during which time the budget doubled to ‚Ç¨200m.

Barcelona‚Äôs other bullring La Monumental another mudejar treasure is privately owned and is up for sale but there have been no takers as yet. As well as bulls it hosted Spain‚Äôs first Rolling Stones concert in 1976.

The Beatles Bob Marley and Bruce Springsteen also performed there but with a capacity of little more than 20000 it like most bullrings is too small for bands on the stadium circuit.

Bullfighting has a long history in Spain with some historians dating it back to prehistoric times. It was banned in Muslim Spain and thus became a symbol of Christian resistance.

Later it was prohibited under various Christian kings who viewed it as unsuitable for aristocrats with the result that it became increasingly popular among the working-class.

Today bullfighting is prohibited in Catalonia as well as the Canary Islands and last year the mayor of Gij√≥n in Asturias was so incensed after a breeder introduced bulls named Feminist and Nigerian into the ring that she banned it effectively ending bullfighting in the region.

Although the constitutional court overturned the bans bullfighting has not returned to those regions and the traditional corrida ‚Äì as opposed to festivals such as the running of the bulls in Pamplona ‚Äì may soon become a thing of the past.

Most bullrings occupy prime city-centre real estate and the logical thing would be to demolish them and build something more useful. However even those that are not listed as being of architectural interest remain just as much an essential feature of the urban fabric of Spain‚Äôs cities and towns as the town hall and the cathedral.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbnkxbm90aWNpYXMuY29tL255Yy9ub3RpY2lhcy9ub3RpY2lhcy8yMDIyLzA4LzIxL2F1bWVudGFuLWxhLXZlbnRhcy1kZWwtZ2FzLXBpbWllbnRhLWNvbW8tYXJtYS1kZS1kZWZlbnNhLWVuLWxhLWNpdWRhZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aumentan la ventas de gas pimienta como arma de defensa,"En medio de lo que le parece una ola de incidentes violentos Yohenny que sale a trabajar de madrugada decidi√≥ tomar cartas en el asunto.

Yohenny Mujica es una usuaria de ltransporte p√∫blico y esto es lo que opina: ""Cuando me monto en el tren lo llevo en la mano y espero nunca tener que usarlo pero me hace sentir un poquito m√°s segura.""

Lo que lleva en la mano es uno de estos contenedores de pimienta en aerosol cuya popularidad ha aumentado dr√°stica y r√°pidamente a pesar de las restricciones en vigor para obtenerlos. En el estado de Nueva York se debe tener al menos 18 a√±os y ning√∫n antecedente penal por agresi√≥n ni condena por delitos graves. La ley estatal tampoco permite su compra en l√≠nea y al adquirirlo en una farmacia autorizada como √©sta debes firmar un formulario y no puedes adquirir m√°s de 2 botes a la vez.

Otra usuaria del transporte p√∫blico Maria Mu√±oz: ""Si alguien viene a atacarte t√∫ puedes echarle el spray en los ojos y eso te ayuda ya que hay mucha gente tremenda en la calle"" agrega.

Gloria Robles residente de Manhattan: ""No s√© puede ser que esa misma cosa que tengamos para defensa se la quiten a uno y la usen en tu contra. Es muy peligroso.""

Estos dispositivos hoy en d√≠a pueden incluir alarmas rastreadores que pueden compartir instant√°neamente tu ubicaci√≥n con sus amigos familia y la polic√≠a. Los expertos concuerdan en que us√°ndose correctamente ‚Äîcruzando la cara de un atacante a la altura de los ojos‚Äî el aerosol pimienta es una herramienta que puede hacer la diferencia entre convertirse en v√≠ctima y huir de un criminal.

Sammy Ravelo es un Teniente retirado del NYPD y experto en seguridad y esto es lo que nos cont√≥: Es un arma simplemente para uno poder opacar a la persona temporalmente es una protecci√≥n temporal que s√≠ te puede ayudar en asaltos y darte tiempo a escapar a que grites y quiz√°s haga que el asaltante pare.

Y cada vez hay m√°s mujeres que quieren que su adquisici√≥n sea menos complicada.

Yohenny Mujica opina que ""Es una forma de alejar el peligro de ti. Deber√≠an d√°rselo a todas las mujeres que trabajan temprano.""

La mayor parte de los rociadores de pimienta en aerosol tienen un alcance de entre 10 y 12 pies de distancia.

Esta es la raz√≥n,"Para muchos es un sue√±o vivir en los Estados Unidos y m√°s en condados como Miami-Dade y Palm Beach. Sin embargo las altas tasas de inflaci√≥n que han afectado los √∫ltimos meses al pa√≠s pueden en algunos casos obstruir el arraigo en tierras americanas para la compra de vivienda.

Seg√∫n los informes de la Asociaci√≥n de Agentes Inmobiliarios de Miami una parte del Sur de la Florida se vio afectada en la venta de residencias que disminuy√≥ hasta el 50 % exactamente en tres condados registrando m√°s de seis meses de una baja en ventas en este a√±o comparado con el mes de julio del 2021.

Cabe se√±alar que los tres condados con m√°s habitantes en la Florida son Palm Beach Miami-Dade y Broward que tienen resultados notorios ante el incremento de tasas de inter√©s que no son proporcionales en la venta inmobiliaria.

De acuerdo con The Real Deal el condado de Broward se vio afectado en ventas de viviendas unifamiliares porque su precio aument√≥ hasta en un 21 % con una recesi√≥n de venta del 28 %.

Por su parte los condominios no tuvieron un alza en sus precios pero sus ventas no fueron visibles.

Por su parte Palm Beach tampoco se destaca en ventas pues sus condominios por su baja demanda alcanzaron una reducci√≥n de ventas en un 33 % que seg√∫n como lo cuenta el sitio entre condominios y casas unifamiliares suman 2.222 ventas una cifra no favorable pero s√≠ relevante para el sector.

En el caso de Miami-Dade un lugar tur√≠stico tuvo una ca√≠da en ventas hasta del 53 % siendo los condominios los que se vieron m√°s afectados hasta en un 39 % en ventas y las residencias familiares en un 27 %.

Inflaci√≥n anual en Estados Unidos comenz√≥ a ceder y baj√≥ a 85 % en julio

Despu√©s de marcar un nivel r√©cord en el mes de junio del 91 % la Oficina de Estad√≠sticas Laborales de Estados Unidos revel√≥ que en julio la inflaci√≥n anual en ese pa√≠s comenz√≥ a ceder y baj√≥ a 85 % principalmente por la ca√≠da del precio de la gasolina.

El precio de la gasolina se redujo un 77 % durante el mes pasado y compens√≥ alzas en los precios de los alimentos y vivienda lo que da como resultado que el √≠ndice de todos los art√≠culos no cambie durante el mes. El √≠ndice de energ√≠a cay√≥ 46 % durante el mes a medida que los precios de la gasolina y el gas natural disminuyeron pero el costo de la electricidad aument√≥.

El alivio de la subida de los precios en julio respondi√≥ a la moderaci√≥n del encarecimiento de la energ√≠a al 329 % desde el 416 % de junio mientras que en el caso de los alimentos la escalada de los precios se aceler√≥ al 109 % desde el 104 % de junio el mayor aumento desde mayo de 1979.

La inflaci√≥n tambi√©n afecta a los Estados Unidos. | Foto: Getty Images

Sin tener en cuenta el impacto de los alimentos y de la energ√≠a la tasa de inflaci√≥n subyacente de Estados Unidos en julio fue del 59 % en l√≠nea con el dato del mes anterior. En comparaci√≥n con el mes de junio la tasa mensual de inflaci√≥n se mantuvo estable despu√©s de que el mes pasado registrase un incremento mensual del 13 %.

Aunque la inflaci√≥n de Estados Unidos baj√≥ a 85 % sigue siendo la m√°s alta desde 1981 (41 a√±os) y esto podr√≠a impulsar a la Reserva Federal (Fed) a subir fuertemente las tasas de inter√©s otra vez tras un alza de 075 puntos porcentuales en julio para llevarlas entre 225 % y 250 %.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZGlhcmlvYXIuY29tL211bmRvL2NyZWNlbi12ZW50YXMtbW9jaGlsYXMtYW50aWJhbGFzLWVwaWRlbWlhLXRpcm90ZW9zLWVzY29sYXJlcy1lZXV1XzFfOTI1NzAxMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Estados Unidos: crecen las ventas de mochilas antibalas por tiroteos escolares,"El tiroteo escolar de Uvalde (Texas) en el que fueron asesinados 19 ni√±os y dos maestras en mayo pasado sigue muy presente entre el profesorado el alumnado y los padres de Estados Unidos y se nota incluso en la lista de materiales para la vuelta al colegio que este pr√≥ximo curso incluir√° mochilas antibalas o transparentes.

El fundador y jefe ejecutivo de la tienda especializada en seguridad The Home Security Superstore David Artman cuenta a EFE que not√≥ en los √∫ltimos 30 d√≠as un aumento tanto en las b√∫squedas como en las ventas de estas peculiares mochilas.

En el √∫ltimo mes casi 9.000 personas buscaron este tipo de morrales en la web de la tienda de Artman un 3.655 % m√°s en comparaci√≥n con el mes pasado un inter√©s que tambi√©n detectan otros vendedores y fabricantes de mochilas ‚Äúblindadas‚Äù.

Con respecto a las ventas Artman dice que crecieron en general pero que es dif√≠cil contabilizar las de uso escolar porque ‚Äúhoy en d√≠a muchos ni√±os tienen el mismo tama√±o que un adulto‚Äù y es imposible averiguar cuantas mochilas terminan en las espaldas de menores y de mayores.

La idea es que en caso de un tiroteo el ni√±o pueda usar la mochila como un escudo pero Artman recuerda que a la hora de comprar este tipo de productos los padres tienen que tener en cuenta varios factores como el tipo de protecci√≥n que quieren el tama√±o y el peso.

Por ejemplo una mochila de su tienda con un dise√±o de emoticonos dirigida para los ni√±os con protecci√≥n del nivel 3A -es decir que puede bloquear casi todos los disparos de pistola incluidas las balas Magnum de 9 y 44 mm- pesa 12 kilos y mide 4191 cm de alto por 3048 cm de ancho.

Artman recomienda a los padres que corten las dimensiones que ellos buscan en un cart√≥n y se pregunten si su hijo podr√≠a protegerse y que tengan en cuenta que a mayor tama√±o consiguen m√°s seguridad pero a cambio de m√°s peso.

‚ÄúEstamos haciendo todo lo posible para informar que no todas las mochilas van a detener todas las r√°fagas y ciertamente no las r√°fagas de AR 15 (rifle que us√≥ Salvador Ramos en la masacre de la escuela de Texas)‚Äù a√±ade.

Mochilas transparentes

Otros centros escolares optaron por otras soluciones diferentes en busca de mayor seguridad: as√≠ varios distritos escolares de Texas exigir√°n este curso entrante que los alumnos de sexto a duod√©cimo grado (entre 11 y 18 a√±os) lleven mochilas transparentes o de malla.

‚ÄúReconocemos que las mochilas transparentes o de malla por s√≠ solas no eliminar√°n los problemas de seguridad. Este es simplemente uno de varios pasos en el plan integral del distrito para garantizar mejor la seguridad de los estudiantes y el personal‚Äù dijo el distrito escolar de Dallas (Texas) tras anunciar la medida a mediados de julio.

El distrito ya compr√≥ las mochilas transparentes y est√° listo para distribuirlas antes del comienzo del a√±o escolar.

Un ‚Äúteatro de seguridad‚Äù

El presidente de la firma nacional de consultor√≠a en seguridad escolar National School Safety and Security Services Ken Trump anota a Efe que tanto las mochilas antibalas como las transparentes aportan una especie de ‚Äúpaz mental‚Äù para los padres m√°s que una ‚Äúseguridad en s√≠‚Äù para los alumnos.

Con respecto a los macutos antibalas Trump que no est√° relacionado con el ex presidente se√±ala que m√°s bien son ‚Äúresistentes a las balas no realmente a prueba de balas‚Äù.

En el caso de los que son transparentes el experto explica que entrar con una pistola es tan sencillo como enrollarla en una sudadera. ‚ÄúLa realidad es que los que entran con armas a una escuela muy a menudo las llevan encima. As√≠ que creo que eso es una especie de teatro de seguridad para crear la percepci√≥n de que se est√° haciendo algo y hacer que las personas se sientan emocionalmente seguras‚Äù subraya.

Adem√°s el experto destaca que tanto los padres como los encargados de seguridad de las escuelas tienen que preguntarse si las medidas en torno a estos raros eventos son efectivas o est√°n creando m√°s ansiedad e inseguridad para el alumnado.

Esta semana se viraliz√≥ en TikTok un video de una madre de Oklahoma ense√±ando a su hijo de 5 a√±os c√≥mo usar una mochila antibalas de Spider-Man y los pasos que ten√≠a que seguir en el caso de un tiroteo en su clase.

Los tiroteos escolares en EE. UU. alcanzaron su m√°ximo de dos d√©cadas en 2021 con 93 tiroteos escolares de los que se tiene constancia seg√∫n un informe del Centro Nacional de Estad√≠sticas Educativas.

Newgarden from Nashville Tennessee drove to his series-leading fifth victory of the season in the No. 2 PPG Team Penske Chevrolet by .4708 of a second over rookie David Malukas whose spirited charge after the race restarted fell just short in the No. 18 HMD Honda but still resulted in a career-best finish. This also was Newgarden‚Äôs third straight victory at this 1.25-mile oval in the shadows of the Gateway Arch.

SEE: Race Results | Race Highlights

‚ÄúI was so happy we could finish this race‚Äù Newgarden said. ‚ÄúScott McLaughlin he wanted to win too. I love that about us. We have a good relationship. He drove me super fair there at the end.‚Äù

Two-time series champion Newgarden pulled to within three points of teammate and series leader Will Power in the race for the Astor Challenge Cup with just two races remaining. NTT P1 Award winner Power led a race-high 128 laps but finished sixth in the No. 12 Verizon Team Penske Chevrolet.

Scott McLaughlin finished third in the No. 3 Odyssey Battery Team Penske Chevrolet despite leading at the restart with 37 laps remaining after a red flag of two hours nine minutes due to rain and lightning.

Pato O‚ÄôWard finished fourth in the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet while two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Takuma Sato placed fifth for his best result this season in the No. 51 Nurtec ODT Honda.

The championship race remains taut and tense. Seven drivers are still mathematically eligible to win the title with just 58 points ‚Äì only four more than the maximum awarded at one race ‚Äì separating leader Power from seventh-place O‚ÄôWard.

Up next is the Grand Prix of Portland on Sunday Sept. 4 at Portland International Raceway. The season ends with the Firestone Grand Prix of Monterey on Sunday Sept. 11 at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca.

The official distance of this race was 260 laps but the rain delay almost made it feel like a 213-lap race in daylight followed by a 47-lap trophy dash under the lights.

When the race resumed at 9:05 p.m. local time track conditions had changed significantly because the rain cleaned the asphalt and there was better grip due to lower temperatures after sundown.

The starting field returned to the track under caution after the red flag was lifted and McLaughlin pulled away when the green flag flew on Lap 224. But Newgarden wasted no time tucking under McLaughlin‚Äôs gearbox on the back straightaway and dove under his teammate in Turn 3 on Lap 225 the first full lap after the restart to take the lead for good.

‚ÄúWe just had to have a good start‚Äù Newgarden said. ‚ÄúI knew Scott was going to be good at the end there and he had a great restart. I just tried to work the high lane. The high lane worked earlier for me. We just had enough to get by him. He was no slouch this weekend.‚Äù

McLaughlin stayed within approximately six-tenths of a second of his teammate for the next 34 laps but couldn‚Äôt find a way past. Meanwhile Malukas put the exclamation point on the most thrilling drive of his young career to advance from fifth at the restart to second at the finish.

Chicago-area native Malukas reached third place by passing O‚ÄôWard on Lap 245 and then set his sights on Newgarden and McLaughlin.

‚ÄúWe ended up getting around O‚ÄôWard and we ended up getting past a lapped car and they (pit box) said ‚ÄòYou see them in front‚Äô and I saw two Penskes and I was like ‚ÄòOh my God they‚Äôre Penskes!‚Äô They were tough.‚Äù

While he never challenged Newgarden Malukas passed McLaughlin for second on the final lap with a brave full-send outside move in Turn 1 aided by the additional traction of the cooler temperatures and clean racetrack.

Malukas‚Äô previous-best finish before this stirring result was eighth last month in the second race of the doubleheader at the Iowa Speedway oval.

Teams attempted various pit strategies in the second half of the race to try and be out front when the expected rain arrived taking an unlikely win if the race didn‚Äôt restart. Malukas and Sato were on an alternate strategy that pushed Malukas to the lead from Laps 207-211 but he was forced to pit. The rain arrived just two laps later.

It appeared pit strategy and traffic may have foiled Newgarden just before the rain arrived.

McLaughlin pitted from second on Lap 207. Newgarden stopped one lap later from the lead but followed rookie Christian Lundgaard in the No. 30 Mi-Jack Honda into the pits with Newgarden‚Äôs pit in lap clocking in at 1.065 seconds slower than McLaughlin‚Äôs. McLaughlin kept the lead when Newgarden blended back to the racetrack after his stop holding the front until the red flag.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvYXVnLzIwL25vcnRoLWxpdHRsZS1yb2NrLWFyZW5hLXRvLXN0b3AtaG9zdGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,North Little Rock arena to stop hosting graduations | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"NORTH LITTLE ROCK -- Operators of the Simmons Bank Arena in North Little Rock have notified school systems and higher education institutions that they will no longer make the large venue available for graduations.

""It's due to safety concerns"" Jana DeGeorge the arena's director of marketing said Thursday. ""In 23 years we have had three shootings outside of the building and they all have been at graduations.""

Shots were fired most recently May 17 after the North Little Rock High School graduation that night according to police and DeGeorge.

Officers responded to the shots around 9:15 p.m. according to reports by police at the time. Shortly before the shots police had been alerted to a possible disturbance with a weapon near the intersection of Riverfront Drive and Olive Street about a block south of the stadium. No injuries were reported and no weapons were located at the scene.

That was preceded just days before by a shooting after a May 12 graduation in Hot Springs DeGeorge noted.

In the Hot Springs case one person was killed and three others wounded outside the Hot Springs Convention Center in the aftermath of the Hot Springs World Class High School graduation ceremony.

""We want it to be safe and it's not safe so we are not going to do it"" DeGeorge said about forgoing graduations in the arena that can hold as many as 18000 people. ""I'm sure there are some [institutions] that are not happy and I totally understand that.""

The arena typically hosted 12 to 15 graduations a year DeGeorge said.

""All the schools have been called earlier this month to let them know that we weren't going to be hosting graduations anymore. That includes UAMS and Baptist Health. It's not just high schools"" she said.

The North Little Rock School District highlighted on its website this week the news about Simmons Bank Arena and that as a result the high school's Class of 2023 graduation ceremony will occur across the Arkansas River June 1 2023 at the Jack Stephens Center on the campus of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.

The Jack Stephens Center holds about 5600 people.

""We wanted to share this information well in advance so that our seniors and families can prepare for this big day"" district spokesman Dustin Barnes posted on the website.

Leslie W. Taylor vice chancellor for communications and marketing for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences said the university has used the North Little Rock arena for commencement exercises for several years most recently at a cost of $24389.

""It has been a wonderful location and provided us with enough seating for our nearly 1000 graduates taking part in commencement and their family members"" Taylor said. ""This year we had several thousand people in attendance and most of the arena was full even a great deal of the upper deck. We appreciate all of the staff of the arena and have enjoyed working with them on this event.

""We are moving commencement to Barton Coliseum for May of 2023"" Taylor said.

The Bryant Class of 2022 graduation ceremony was hosted at Simmons as was the ceremony in 2019 and years prior to that Bryant spokeswoman Devin Sherrill said Thursday.

The Bryant High School event that attracts as many as 10000 people used War Memorial Stadium in the spring of 2021.

After recently learning that Simmons would not be available Bryant district leaders are currently evaluating venues for the Class of 2023's graduation ceremony Sherrill said.

The Little Rock School District in the past two years has taken the graduation ceremonies outdoors -- using War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock -- and will do so again.

The district first used the stadium in 2021 and again in May 2022 at least in part as a way to limit the spread of covid-19. The outdoor stadium seats more than 50000 people and attendees could practice social distancing. War Memorial has been selected for the 2023 events district spokeswoman Pamela Smith said Thursday.

The Pulaski County Special School District has in recent years held its graduations at the Jack Stephens Center at UALR.

The North Little Rock-based Simmons arena opened as Alltel Arena in October of 1999 as a central Arkansas site for sports entertainment and meetings and conferences. The arena was later renamed Verizon Arena before becoming what is now the Simmons Bank Arena.

The arena is publicly owned by the Multi-Purpose Civic Center Facilities Board for Pulaski County. The arena was funded by a combination of local state and private monies.

Many have been speculating about the future of NASCAR Cup Series competitor Kyle Busch after questions arose about his future with Joe Gibbs Racing.

This season is the final year of his deal with the team after a sponsorship fell through for next season. And it appears that the uncertainty of his racing career appears to be taking a toll on Busch (seen above preparing for qualifying at the Verizon 200 at the Brickyard in July).

Despite both sides saying that they would like to remain together the lack of a sponsor may be a huge roadblock in making that happen. Busch he revealed on Saturday that the uncertainty around the situation has been hard on him.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been hard as h*** said Busch. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a lot of sleepless nights figuring out what your future is and all that sort of stuff.‚Äù

#NASCAR ‚Ä¶ I asked Kyle Busch about what he has gone through this year with his plans for next year uncertain. He opened up ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/9bCmmMvDnU ‚Äî Dustin Long (@dustinlong) August 20 2022

Busch has been with Joe Gibbs Racing since 2008. But it seems more and more likely that he may have to seek another team if he wants to continue racing next season.

‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs like ‚ÄòOh well you‚Äôve made plenty of money you‚Äôre fine you don‚Äôt have anything to worry about‚Äô‚Äù Busch added. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm like ‚ÄòYeah that‚Äôs true but you still want to do what you love to do right? I‚Äôm in the same boat.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a racer. I‚Äôve only ever known how to race. Nothing else. (I‚Äôm) trying to do other business projects and things like that but none of them have really like blown up and taken off. So it has been hard and figuring out all of that is certainly tough.‚Äù

Many around the NASCAR world understand Busch‚Äôs stance of being afraid of the unknown element in his career.

Much respect for @KyleBusch . @ToyotaRacing should sponsor his car for next year to give more time to find permanent sponsor. He‚Äôs done a helluva lot for them in nascar series both in cars and trucks. Hate to see him finish with another manufacturer. https://t.co/7DV2FPP6qz ‚Äî üá∫üá∏üî¥‚ö™Brandonüî¥‚ö´üáªüá¶ (@UGAFALCONS1) August 20 2022

This is why i like @KyleBusch . Unfiltered no bs all the time. Oh and hes talented and a great racer. https://t.co/ejQMBzZUVV ‚Äî skip (@mj092288) August 20 2022

Upset that our sport is built on sponsorship dollars and that a generational talent doesn't have a job. LeBron will play as long as he wants to. Gretzky played as long as he wanted. This is very sad. https://t.co/Cnc6MkKTzG ‚Äî Chicago Street Race Stan (@TomHobbs636) August 20 2022

Some teams that have been listed as a potential landing spot for Busch are Stewart-Haas Racing and Kaulig Racing. Both of those would certainly be interesting possibilities for Busch.

Busch certainly has a lot on his mind but his focus on Sunday will be on winning at Watkins Glen where he will be starting in 10th place to begin the race.

In times of crisis human solidarity and support take the form of concrete actions. In Europe particularly countries bordering Ukraine Viatris employees worked to welcome the influx of people crossing over to safety.

Some opened their homes to people. Others gathered humanitarian supplies and brought them to refugee camps or volunteered to drive their colleagues to new locations.

Early on in France Viatris partnered with Tulipe a humanitarian relief organization that organizes donations of pharmaceuticals to areas in need. The company sent several tons of products to Ukraine on an airplane specially chartered by the French government underscoring its commitment to delivering essential medicines everywhere.

The company also donated hundreds of thousands of doses of medicines to Ukraine through longtime partner Direct Relief. Employees contributed financially in a company-wide campaign which Viatris matched to double the donation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We think we‚Äôve got it figured out though. Grab your favorite hot drink (or glass of wine‚Ä¶it‚Äôs always a good option) and let us take you on a wild ride of how we see this playing out.

B&B Spoilers Wild Speculation

Picture this; Quinn is a woman currently on cloud nine. She has a hot new boyfriend who she can‚Äôt get enough of she‚Äôs thriving at work even though she‚Äôs still at the mercy of her very generous ex and she‚Äôs even come to terms with Eric Forrester‚Äôs (John McCook) reunion with Donna Logan (Jennifer Gareis). It‚Äôs messy but a good messy. Everything is the way it should be.

Quinn and Carter decide they want to throw themselves a little party (a wedding? Should it be a wedding?) so she runs off to Il Giardino to whip up some plans. Hey nothing like getting your ex who you tried to murder by pushing him off a cliff to lend a hand right?

B&B: Wrong Place Wrong Time

Unfortunately Deacon isn‚Äôt at the bar. No problem she knows where she lives so she decides to simply stop by. Shouldn‚Äôt be an issue right? Well not normally. But sadly this time is going to be much much different.

Without thinking Quinn will knock twice and enter. But what she‚Äôll walk into isn‚Äôt Deacon tinkering about it‚Äôll be an unmasked Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown). Talk about a shocker! This bombshell will blindside Quinn and she‚Äôll hardly have time to react before Sheila jumps into action.

B&B Spoilers: The Death of Quinn

Sheila knows her freedom will ride and die keeping Quinn quiet. Deacon was one thing but Quinn is another. Even if Quinn promises to keep mum Sheila is well aware the second she walks out the door she‚Äôll have the cops on the phone.

So Sheila does the only thing she can do to protect herself and silences Quinn once and for all. Poor Quinn won‚Äôt make it out of the room alive. Think this wild speculation could really happen? Let us know in the comments section below.

""If I leave I can't come back. So I've got to stay here for a while.""

Nixon Newell (fka Tegan Nox) hasn't wrestled since October. The former ""WWE NXT"" superstar was released from the company in November and has spent the months since inactive but contrary to what some have asked the Welsh wrestler hasn't retired. She's been caught up in red tape.

""I've been trying to get my green card for the last eight months"" Nox told the ""Sappenin'"" podcast. ""So if I leave then I can't come back ... It's just been a boring eight months living in Orlando.""

Nox sounded frustrated with the situation but she's been trying to make the most of it joking that she can ""go to Disney World everyday"" if she wants to.

""I can stay in America I just can't leave the States"" Nox said. ""Because I haven't got the visa or the green card I can't wrestle. So I keep getting messages 'Have you retired?' No I just can't. Legally. I can't.""

Nox isn't the only international wrestler dealing with visa issues. Former ""NXT"" Champion Finn Balor revealed earlier this year that he had to miss the Royal Rumble to get a new visa and ""WWE Raw"" superstar Doudrop had to miss this year's WrestleMania to get her own visa issues sorted out.

Nox's plan for waiting out the visa and green card process is simple: chilling.

""I've just been chilling in the house playing video games going to Sad Summer Fest"" she said. ""Chilling with my dogs. Chilling with my friends.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

This season probably won‚Äôt change that trend but there ARE some changes in the OAA with the addition of Harper Woods ‚Äî the first football program to enter the league since Oxford in 2010 ‚Äî giving the league 22 teams allowing the OAA to go to four divisions for the first time since 2003.

Adams bumped back up into the OAA Red Division after winning the White last season but West Bloomfield was tabbed as a narrow favorite in the Red by the preseason coaches poll with Adams right behind. Southfield A&T (White) North Farmington (Blue) and Berkley (Gold) were also installed as favorites in their respective divisions by the voting of the coaches.

Here‚Äôs a capsule look at how each of the OAA‚Äôs 22 teams shapes up for the 2022 season:

OAA RED

CLARKSTON WOLVES

Coach: Justin Pintar (1st year)

Last Year‚Äôs Record: 8-2

Key Returners on Offense: Ethan Clark (RB Sr.); Cole Dellinger (OL Sr.); Kohl Jarvis (WR Sr.); Mike Hein (QB Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Cavanaugh Ditton (LB Sr.); Desman Stephens (CB/S/LB Jr.) Jaylen Wilson (CB Sr.)

Strengths: Skill positions offensive line linebackers secondary

Areas to Improve: Overall depth defensive line

Outlook: Justin Pintar takes the coaching reins from the legendary Kurt Richardson and inherits a group of playmakers on both sides of the ball. Ethan Clark will be a candidate for Mr. Football out of the backfield and Mike Hein switches from receiver to quarterback for his senior season. Cole Dellinger (Michigan State) is one of the best offensive linemen in the country and the defense plays with feistiness under the leadership of hard-hitting Cavanaugh Ditton. The Wolves should challenge defending league champ West Bloomfield and 2021 D1 state finalist Rochester Adams for the league title this fall.

LAKE ORION DRAGONS

Coach: Chris Bell (20th year)

Last Year‚Äôs Record: 3-6

Key Returners on Offense: Billy Roberson (RB Jr.); Dorian Hill (WR Sr.); Caleb Jones (WR Sr.); Edwin Morris (OL Sr.); Carlo Fortino (OL Sr.); Connor O‚ÄôRourke (OL Jr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Judah Kinne (DL Sr.); J.P. Patterson (OL Sr.); Alec Fisher (OL Sr.); Patrick Rowland (LB Sr.); Trey Pochmara (CB Soph.); Corbin Smith (CB Jr.)

Strengths: Speed size athleticism

Areas to Improve: Stabilizing the new QB situation depth at linebacker

Outlook: Chris Bell is back on the sidelines after a five-year hiatus and he has a home-run hitter in the backfield in Billy Roberson. A veteran offensive line will clear his path and a fleet-footed receiving corps should keep defenses honest. Judah Kinne and Patrick Rowland headline a rugged defensive unit. Bell‚Äôs club is hoping to play sleeper in the league race.

OXFORD WILDCATS

Coach: Zach Line (3rd year)

Last Year‚Äôs Record: 6-5

Key Returners on Offense: Eli Tabert (RB Sr.); Gavin Aldred (OL Sr.); Logan Wilmont (TE Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Cam Jarrett (LB Sr.); Brody Moore (S Jr.)

Strengths: Chemistry running back linebacker

Areas to Improve: Experience figuring out pass game

Outlook: The Wildcats will be drawing inspiration from their fallen teammate and captain Tate Myre who died in the Oxford school shooting last year. According to Line his club is ‚Äúon a mission to play for Tate and do him proud‚Äù by continuing what he started last year in the second season of the Line regime where they upset Clarkston in the playoffs.

ROCHESTER ADAMS HIGHLANDERS

Coach: Tony Patritto (20th year)

Last Year‚Äôs Record: 13-1 OAA White champion played in D1 state championship game

Key Returners on Offense: Parker Picot (QB Sr.); Brady Prieskorn (TE Jr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Tait Picot (LB Sr.); Rocco Orsini (LB/DL Sr.); Nick Patera (S Sr.); Hassan Murray (CB Sr.)

Strengths: Senior leadership quarterback tight end linebackers secondary

Areas to Improve: The need to find a go-to rusher defensive line play

Outlook: Led by the dynamic Picot brothers and All-American tight end Brady Prieskorn (No. 1 recruit at his position in the nation) the Highlanders are gunning for a return trip to the state finals come November. Parker Picot (Alabama baseball commit) is as exciting and productive a signal caller there is in the state. Do-everything senior Nick Patera will quarterback the defense from his free safety spot. Rocco Orsini is a grinder with a high motor up front. Adams makes the move up from the White Division to compete for the Red title against West Bloomfield and Clarkston.

STONEY CREEK COUGARS

Coach: Nick Merlo (5th year)

Last Year‚Äôs Record: 4-5

Key Returners on Offense: Jon Fogler (RB Sr.); Sam McDermott (WR Sr.); Jacob Kropchak (OL Jr.); Calvin Gibson (C Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Seth Luhman (LB Sr.); Adam Bazzi (LB Jr.); Ben Korson (DL Sr.); Kyle Parks (CB Jr.)

Strengths: Rushing attack linebacker unit

Areas to Improve: QB play pass rush defensive backfield

Outlook: Nick Merlo loves his running game this season and will rely heavily on his signature ground-and-pound approach again in 2022. Fogler is one of the more undervalued tailbacks in the area maybe all of Metro Detroit. Junior Jacob Kropchak is a high-riser in recruiting circles right now on the offensive line. Seth Luhman and Adam Bazzi make up a formidable linebacker duo to spur on the defense.

WEST BLOOMFIELD LAKERS

Coach: Tyrice Grice (2nd year)

Last Year‚Äôs Record: 10-2 OAA Red champion won D1 district title

Key Returners on Offense: Reqez Nance (QB Jr.); Kenny Jones (RB Sr.); Semaj Morgan (WR Sr.) Amir Herring (OL Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Brandon Davis-Swain (DE Jr.); Kari Jackson (LB Jr.); Jamir Benjamin (CB Jr.); Deonte Pippen (CB Sr.); Lorenzo Williams (CB Sr.); Adrian Epps (S Sr.)

Strengths: Speed skill positions offensive line pass rush secondary

Areas to Improve: Linebacker and receiver depth

Outlook: Another high-flying high-octane ‚ÄúLake Show‚Äù is ready to roll in the Swamp this season with Reqez Nance and Semaj Morgan (Michigan) forming an elite pass-catch duo on offense and Notre Dame-commit Brandon Davis-Swain bringing the pain in the pass rush coming off a sophomore campaign where he reeled in 18 sacks. Michigan commit Amir Herring heads the protection unit in the trenches. Four-star recruit Kari Jackson returns from prep school to highlight the linebacker corps and the secondary is once again the best in the county. Expect West Bloomfield to be tough to unseat as OAA Red champ and be knocking on the door for a ticket to Ford Field come playoff time.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

OAA WHITE

BIRMINGHAM GROVES FALCONS

Coach: Brendan Flaherty (22nd year)

Last Year's Record: 2-7 2-3 OAA White

Key Returners on Offense: Cayden Hardy (QB Jr.) Morgan Goldberg (OG Sr.) Alex Koellner (OL Sr.) Avery Gach (OL Soph.) Jack Wainer (TE Sr.) Owen Higley (SE Sr.) Isaiah Tomazin (OL Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Zach Rogers (FS Jr.) Aidan Wahn (DL) Jackson Crane (LB Sr.) Elias Kendra (LB Sr.) Braden Hall (DL Jr.) Max Young (OLB Sr.) Malachi Coleman (DL Sr.) Josh Woods (LB Sr.)

Strengths: The Falcons return five starters on offense and seven on defense many of them members of the 23-man senior class that Flaherty is banking on to help the Falcons pull out of their recent tailspin. Groves is especially veteran on the offensive line.

Areas to improve: The Falcons never really recovered from an 0-3 start ‚Äî where they got outscored 15-102 ‚Äî putting up double digits in points just four times all season.

Outlook: If they can find some offense the defense should have enough back to keep the Falcons in contention. After a seven-year span where the Falcons were in contention ‚Äî posting seven or more wins every year and 10 or more three times ‚Äî last year‚Äôs slide to end the streak of eight straight playoff appearances didn‚Äôt sit well with a program that had become one of the elites.

BLOOMFIELD HILLS BLACK HAWKS

Coach: Dan Loria (9th year)

Last Year's Record: 9-1 8-0 OAA Blue

Key Returners on Offense: CJ Jackson (QB Sr.) David Hollins (OL Sr.) Aaron Zekman (WR Sr.) Ahmad Taylor (TE Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Ahmad Taylor (DE Sr.) David Hollins (DL Sr.) Jack Friesen (S Sr.)

Strengths: The Black Hawks have a senior quarterback in CJ Jackson working behind an experienced offensive line and targets in Zekman and Taylor to throw to as they try to recreate the offense that averaged 30 points per game in 2021.

Areas to improve: The Black Hawks will need to find running mates for Jackson in the offensive backfield and the secondary ‚Äî which helped limit opponents to just more than 10 points per game in the regular season last year ‚Äî is young.

Outlook: After a bounce-back in 2021 that saw the Black Hawks win more games (9) than they had in the previous three combined and win the OAA Blue Bloomfield Hills got bumped up to the White where the competition will be stiffer. The record might not be as shiny come the end of the regular season but Loria‚Äôs trying to stress to the faithful that this is where the Black Hawks belong where they need to be to get honed for their next playoff appearance.

HARPER WOODS PIONEERS

Coach: Rod Oden (5th year)

Last Year's Record: 7-3

Key Returners on Offense: Jessten Johnson (OL Jr.) Ramonty Houze (WR/KR Jr.) Antjuan Peterson (PK Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Jacob Oden (CB Jr.) Willie Powell (LB Jr.) Cailin Scott (LB Soph.)

Strengths: The Pioneers will hang their hat defensively on a strong linebacking corps as well as one of the top defensive backs in the nation in Jacob Oden. They return 34 players from last year‚Äôs team including all the players in this year‚Äôs two-deep.

Areas to improve: Harper Woods will have to replace the leadership of quarterback Vinny Booth and running back Christion Stokes and do it while navigating its way into a new league full of programs with much larger enrollments.

Outlook: The Pioneers wanted a home that would get them ready for the yearly battles in the playoffs and appear to have found one in the OAA. Given the size differential with most of the others schools in the White Harper Woods could end up with a record around the .500 mark and still have no problems amassing playoff points.

OAK PARK KNIGHTS

Coach: Greg Carter (12th year)

Last Year's Record: 3-6 2-3 OAA White

Key Returners on Offense: James Blaylock (TE Sr.) Rashard Lewis Timothy Squire Deraut‚Äôa Harris Julius Stewart

Key Returners on Defense: Darnell Boone (MLB Sr.) Dera‚Äôl Washington (DE Sr.) D‚ÄôAimeon Basley (LB Sr.) Myles Burrell (DL Sr.) James Blaylock (DE Sr.)

Strengths: The Knights as they typically have been are a fast team on both sides of the ball and have guys who can get to the ball ‚Äî fast ‚Äî on defense.

Areas to improve: After supplying Power 5 schools with mammoth linemen for several years this year‚Äôs line won‚Äôt be as experienced nor will the player it‚Äôs protecting under center.

Outlook: The Knights pulled it together at the end to become the Cinderella story of the COVID year but couldn‚Äôt pull the same turnaround a year ago. Still it wasn‚Äôt as bad as it might have seemed from the record ‚Äî Oak Park‚Äôs first 3-6 season since Carter‚Äôs first on campus. The Knights were just 18 points away from going into Week 9 at 7-1 rather than 3-5. That included a four-point loss to eventual D1 runner-up Adams the White champion one of four losses by a single score or less. If the Knights can get back to winning the close ones they‚Äôll get right back to where they‚Äôd become accustomed to being.

ROCHESTER FALCONS

Coach: Erik Vernon (13th year)

Last Year's Record: 5-4 4-1 OAA White

Key Returners on Offense: Alex Bueno (QB Sr.) Grant Calcagno (RB/WR Sr) Jaiden Bolden (WR Sr.) Drew Terenzi (OL) Aiden Osentoski (WR/PK Sr.) Tristan Barnett (OL)

Key Returners on Defense: Khamani Potts (DE Sr.) Bolden (DB Sr.) Calcagno (DB Sr.) Noah Putrus (LB Sr.) Royce Winters (DL)

Strengths: The Falcons have the offensive skill positions stacked with senior leaders including quarterback Alex Bueno in his final go-round as Rochester‚Äôs signal-caller and there are pieces in place to make for a solid defense.

Areas to improve: The Falcons lack depth on the offensive and defensive lines and ‚Äî like everybody else ‚Äî just needs to figure out if the younger kids that are filling in new roles can handle their added responsibilities.

Outlook: An emergency starter as a freshman Bueno helped lead the Falcons to a league title as a sophomore and has grown considerably ‚Äî both physically and as a leader ‚Äî in his four years in the role. The Falcons know what they have in Bueno and the rest of their core of veterans but the coin flip about whether or not they‚Äôll be closer to 2020‚Äôs 6-1 campaign or last year‚Äôs 5-4 will be how the newcomers meld into the supporting cast.

SOUTHFIELD A&T WARRIORS

Coach: Aaron Marshall (2nd year)

Last Year's Record: 2-7 1-4 OAA Red

Key Returners on Offense: Isaiah Marshall (QB Jr.) Tashi Braceful (WR Jr.) Davier Burt (RB Jr.) Javin Jones (RB/WR Sr.) Aaron Bradley (OT Sr.) Xavier Davis (OL Sr.) Nigel Dunton (WR Jr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Devon Buskins (S Sr.) Mauricio Clayton (Jr. LB) Jaydon Bush (DB Sr.) Reggie Gardner (DL Jr.) Mathias Davis (DE Jr.) Brendon Wright (LB/DE Sr.)

Strengths: When you add Brother Rice transfer Xavi Bowman and Nigel Dunton to the already explosive junior passing combination of Isaiah Marshall to Tashi Braceful and you‚Äôve got the makings of a frighteningly potent air attack.

Areas to improve: The defensive-minded Marshall knows his guys can probably win their fair share of shootouts but he‚Äôd rather not. Until the Warriors are putting up zeroes he won‚Äôt be entirely happy and that didn‚Äôt happen often enough in Year 1 with the Warriors yielding 40 or more points six times and 50 twice.

Outlook: The talent is there for the Warriors to make noise in the OAA White after dropping down from the Red ‚Äî even if they do still play an amped up schedule that includes crossovers with Clarkston and West Bloomfield and non-conference games against River Rouge and Cass Tech. Marshall was a late hire so he‚Äôs feeling much more comfortable with a full offseason under his belt with his squad and the Warriors only graduated a small senior class of 15 offset by playing 10 sophomores last season. If everything clicks ‚Ä¶

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

OAA BLUE

BIRMINGHAM SEAHOLM MAPLES

Coach: Jim DeWald (11th year)

Last Year's Record: 1-8

Key Returners on Offense: Colton Kinnie (QB Jr.); Kyle Robbins (WR Jr.); Ben Rosenfield (OL Sr.); Dylan Buese (OL Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Jack Hulgrave (LB Sr.); Sean Emerson (CB Jr.); Kaz Villarire (CB Sr.)

Strengths: Line play experience at the skill positions

Areas to Improve: Overall depth special teams play

Outlook: The anguish of last season's one-win campaign has fueled this group in the offseason and has the Maples poised for a bounce-back campaign. Coach DeWald's troops could very well end up going from worst to first as the Maples are trending towards sleeper status in league action.

FARMINGTON FALCONS

Coach: Jason Albrecht (2nd year)

Last Year's Record: 4-5

Key Returners on Offense: Dom Pesci (QB Sr.); Gavin Miller (OL Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Cam Humes (CB Sr.) Mecca Brooks (DE Sr.); Aaron McCray (S Sr.); Jacob Braswell (DE Jr.)

Strengths: Experience at QB line play secondary

Areas to Improve: Finding go-to pass catchers linebacker play

Outlook: Dom Pesci is one of the true diamonds in the rough at the quarterback position in the area and he's made big strides since last year. On defense the Falcons will be tough in the pass rush department and in man-to-man coverage out of the defensive backfield. Farmington hopes to play dark horse in the league race along with Seaholm and Athens.

NORTH FARMINGTON RAIDERES

Coach: Jon Herstein (4th year)

Last Year's Record: 3-6

Key Returners on Offense: Ryan Shelby (QB Jr.); Mill Coleman III (WR Jr..); Jayden Taylor (WR Sr.); Daemon Eubanks (WR Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Brendon Rice (DE Soph.); Anderson Sculati (LB Sr.)

Strengths: Wide receivers depth at QB

Areas to Improve: Lack of experience on the line

Outlook: Returning starting field general Ryan Shelby is out until midseason recovering from a torn ACL and former West Bloomfield back-up Tommy Balazovic has looked good this summer preparing to take ahold of the offense. An elusive and fast receiving corps will aid the transition at quarterback. Sophomore Brendon Rice is a name to watch as a breakout off the edge on pass-rush downs. With 2021 OAA Blue champ Bloomfield Hills jumping up to the OAA White North Farmington moves down to the Blue from the White and is the expected frontrunner for the Blue title this year.

TROY COLTS

Coach: Chris Fraser (5th year)

Last Year's Record: 8-2

Key Returners on Offense: Darius Whiteside (WR Sr.); Nolan Block (RB Jr.); Max Hayden (OL Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Ray Mazreku (LB Sr.); Jaielen Peacock (DL Soph.); Nick Friesen (S Sr.)

Strengths: Wide receiver secondary

Areas to Improve: Line play getting QB situation straightened out

Outlook: Darius Whiteside is one of the most dangerous deep threats in Oakland County at split end and Noah Block runs hard out of the backfield. If the defense holds up its end of the bargain the Colts should be back in the playoffs. The Colts should battle North Farmington for the league crown.

TROY ATHENS REDHAWKS

Coach: Tom Cook (1st year)

Last Year's Record: 5-4

Key Returners on Offense: Kyree Harper (WR Sr.); Luke Summerhill (OL Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Alex Afnan (DL Sr.); Aidan Burtch (LB Sr.)

Strengths: Offense overall depth

Areas to Improve: Adapting to new coaching staff

Outlook: Kyree Harper leads a crew of burners on offense and the Red Hawks are hoping to repeat last year's potency. Based on preseason output the defense will play chippy and overachieve.

OAA GOLD

AUBURN HILLS AVONDALE YELLOW JACKETS

Coach: Corey Bell (4th year)

Last Year's Record: 4-6 4-4 OAA Blue

Key Returners on Offense: DeShawn Robinson (OT Sr.) Terry Daniel (FB Sr.) Cameron Washington (OT Soph.) Cooper Voeffray (WR Soph.) Justin Greer-Sykes (WR Soph.)

Key Returners on Defense: DeShawn Robinson (DL Sr.) Denzel White (DL Sr.) Terry Daniel (LB Sr.) Reefe Henderson (DL Sr.) Mason Moore (DB Sr.) Calvin Cade (DB Sr.) Cameron Washington (DL Soph.) Myles Moore (LB Jr.) Justin Greer-Sykes (LB Soph.) Tyler Herzog (DB Jr.)

Strengths: The Yellow Jackets have size on the lines with 300-pounders in DeShawn Robinson and Cameron Washington anchoring both and return 10 of 11 starters on a defense that only gave up 30-plus points twice.

Areas to improve: Despite a core of that defense being loaded with seniors the Yellow Jackets will still be young especially on offense where there are plenty of opportunities for younger guys to step up. Four freshmen started a year ago and will start again as sophomores.

Outlook: The Yellowjackets will be a young team ‚Äî only time cures that issue ‚Äî but they are talented and are excited about the new divisional alignment giving them a shot at a title and the possibility of hosting a home game in the playoffs again both achievable goals.

BERKLEY BEARS

Coach: Sean Shields (5th year)

Last Year's Record: 7-3 6-2 OAA Blue

Key Returners on Offense: Savod Daniels (RB Sr.) Miron Dover (RB Sr.) Nolan Wesner (TE Sr.) David Rolands (OL Sr.) Hunter Robertson (K/P Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: David Rolands (DE Sr.) Max Walstad (OLB Sr.)

Strengths: Led by the massive Penn commit David Rolands the Bears will be strongest on the lines blowing holes open for backs Savod Daniels and Miron Dover and an accurate kicker in Hunter Robertson an all-state honorable mention last year.

Areas to improve: A defense that gave up fewer points (138 total) than the Bears had since the mid-to-early 1990s has to retool a bit with just Rolands back up front and Walstad behind him. Depth is also an issue and the Bears were 0-9 at both the JV and freshman level a year ago.

Outlook: The high school game is still primarily run-predicated and if you can run the ball ‚Äî and the Bears can ‚Äî and can stop the run you can win games. If the other big linemen available to the Bears can learn how to play on the defensive side of the ball to make the second goal happen the Bears can certainly contend in what should be a wide-open division.

FERNDALE EAGLES

Coach: Eric Royal (9th year)

Last Year's Record: 1-8 1-7 OAA Blue

Key Returners on Offense: Darnell Bates (QB Sr.) Cordae McAlister (WR Sr.) Donye Edward Carson (OL Sr.) Jabari McCunes (RB Sr.) Darrell Kern (OL Sr.) Lavar Croxton (OL Jr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Donye Edward Carson (DL Sr.) Jabari McCunes (LB Sr.) Quintin Sands (DL Sr.) Andrew Mills (LB Sr.) Jacoby Young (LB Jr.) Lavar Croxton (DL Jr.) Gary Maxwell (DB Soph.) Daniel Young (DB Jr.)

Strengths: The Eagles only graduated three seniors and return eight starters on both sides of the ball. Ferndale has a lot of experience and depth back from a team that got a bit of a wake-up call delivered with last year‚Äôs 1-8 record something that‚Äôs been constant motivation for Royal and staff. Depth is good enough that the Eagles may be able to platoon players.

Areas to improve: Three years removed from boasting an offense that averaged 30 points peer game the Eagles struggled to score putting up just 60 total points over the final eight weeks of the regular season.

Outlook: The challenge for Ferndale will be learning how to win football games again after just nine wins over the last three seasons after a three-year stretch of seven- or eight-win seasons from 2016-18.

PONTIAC PHOENIX

Coach: Ken Wade (2nd year)

Last Year's Record: 0-9 0-8 OAA Blue

Key Returners on Offense: Debon Johnson (SB Jr.) Charles White (WR Soph.) Da‚Äôveon Hall (QB Soph.) Khanye Donalson (WR Soph.) Caleb Leatherwood (Sr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Carter Leatherwood (Jr.) Xavier Smith (Soph.) Randell Bush (DB Sr.)

Strengths: The Phoenix have speed that should help continue to improve on the offensive output ‚Äî something that got better last year but not quite enough. They scored just 10 points in seven games in 2020 pushing that to 88 points in nine games last year.

Areas to improve: Depth is still an issue for a program that has a hard time generating and keeping numbers as is experience and the Phoenix have had just one full offseason under the new strength and conditioning program Wade has put in place.

Outlook: With its new on-campus stadium open Pontiac is hoping that the gradual improvement continues and the Phoenix can snap what‚Äôs become the state‚Äôs longest losing streak at 33 games. If head coach Ken Wade is correct and the turnaround is coming it should help continue to bolster enthusiasm for a program which can then lead to keeping some of the city‚Äôs talent at home.

ROYAL OAK RAVENS

Coach: Dustyn Truitt (1st year)

Last Year's Record: 2-7 2-6 OAA Blue

Key Returners on Offense: Hudson Sidle (QB Sr.) Mekhi Jenkins (RB Sr.) Elly Finch (OL Sr.) Carsen Troub (OL Sr.) Aiden Tesch (OL Jr.) Owen Soper (PK Jr.)

Key Returners on Defense: Steven Johnson (MLB Jr.) Colton DeShais (FS Jr.) Evan Towery (DL Sr.) Anthony Garcia (MLB Jr.)

Strengths: The leaders of the Ravens program have helped first-year coach Dustyn Truitt beat the bushes to find more participants pushing the totals from the program from 46 last year to 91 this year. The core of that is a very strong junior class which will lead both this year and next.

Areas to improve: All the new players (and the old) have been learning a brand-new offensive system and overall it‚Äôs a very young program.

Outlook: Having a Division I-caliber running back like Mekhi Jenkins to get the ball to as well as a veteran quarterback in Hudson Sidle certainly eases in a brand-new coach. The Royal Oak program has only had four winning seasons since the merger of Dondero and Kimball ‚Äî two of those in its first two seasons of existence ‚Äî so there‚Äôs still not a tremendous amount of tradition for a new staff to hang its hat on but if the kids are willing to work at building one there‚Äôs a clean slate for all kinds of new things to be written on it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiywFodHRwczovL2xhbmNhc3Rlcm9ubGluZS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2hzY2hvb2wvZ2lybHN0ZW5uaXMvbWFuaGVpbS10b3duc2hpcHMtdGVhbS1wZW5uLW1hbm9ycy1jYXRoZXJpbmUtcmFiYXRpbi1sb29rLWZvci1jb250aW51ZWQtc3VjY2Vzcy1vbi10ZW5uaXMtY291cnQvYXJ0aWNsZV9iMWY2YzQwZS0yMTYwLTExZWQtYTk1Zi03NzhjZGNjMDRkNGMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Manheim Township's team Penn Manor's Catherine Rabatin look for continued success on tennis court,"The more things change the more they stay the same.

Manheim Township‚Äôs girls tennis team and Penn Manor senior Catherine Rabatin are hoping that adage holds true for them this season.

The Blue Streaks were 16-1 last year storming through the Lancaster-Lebanon League and District Three Class 3A before suffering their only loss in the first round of the PIAA tournament.

That capped a marvelous run under coach John Briner who stepped down after last season with a four-year record of 63-4. His assistant Carolyn Miller takes over this season.

Along with another year and a change of coaches comes a change of players. Most notably is Avery Palandjian who reached the L-L and district finals and advanced to the second round of states in a career marked by many successes but graduated.

Another year for Rabatin means trying to go a perfect 4-0 in her career in L-L and district 3A championships. She has reached the PIAA semifinals all three years.

Here are five things to watch in L-L girls tennis this season.

More of the same?

Manheim Township won its seventh straight league title and sixth straight District Three Class 3A crown in 2021. The Streaks will try to add to those marks without Palandjian.

Senior Kayla Kurtz will be looked at to lead the Streaks after reaching the 3A semifinals in the L-L where she lost to Palandjian and District Three before losing in the first round at states. She and Palandjian won L-L Flight 1 doubles.

Junior Jade Miller also returns after winning L-L Flight Two singles.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very hopeful for this season‚Äù said Miller in an email. ‚ÄúAlthough losing three varsity players I‚Äôm gaining several freshman players with lots of potential. I‚Äôve also seen great improvement with some of my returning players.‚Äù

Rabatin beat Palandjian for both the L-L and district 3A titles. After dropping a 6-1 4-6 10-1 decision to Palandjian during the regular season she prevailed 6-4 6-2 in the league final and 6-0 2-6 6-3 for the district title.

‚ÄúShe has been training and playing tournaments in the offseason to get her prepared for her final season with Penn Manor and set herself up for success at the collegiate level‚Äù said Penn Manor coach Amanda Pryzbylkowski in an email.

Lancaster Catholic senior Anna Millen also hopes to follow suit after she repeated as the L-L and District Three Class 2A champion.

Others to watch

Right behind the Streaks in Section One was Hempfield (13-3) which lost close matches to Township in the regular season and L-L tournament. Township defeated the Knights 3-1 to win the L-L title.

Gone is No. 1 player Grace Lehman who reached the L-L semifinals but juniors Sophie Carson and Lydia Sullivan and sophomore Alex Gregory return. Carson teamed with Lehman to finish second in Flight One doubles while Sullivan won Flight Two doubles and Gregory Flight Three singles.

Lancaster Country Day put together a solid campaign last year going 11-5 7-1 in Section Three and advanced to the District Three 2A tournament. Maggie Auman a senior this year led the way.

Auman advanced to the L-L 2A semifinals as well as the district tournament losing to the eventual runner-up in the first round.

She teamed with Sophia Babar now a sophomore to finish second in the L-L 2A doubles and earn a No. 2 seeding in the district tournament.

Elco‚Äôs Ali Bender returns after winning the Lebanon County title and was an L-L Section Three all-star after reaching the league‚Äôs Class 2A semifinals. She‚Äôs part of a Raiders team that returns its entire lineup including Camryn Lehr who teamed with Bender to advance to both the L-L and district 2A semifinals.

That‚Äôs new

Making its first appearance in the league will be Linden Hall. The Lady Lions were 6-7 last year under Steve Berkley in his 15th year as head coach and return three of their top five singles players in seniors Ava O‚ÄôBrien Mia Rossi and Melissa Figueroa.

Linden Hall will compete in the nine-team Section Three.

That‚Äôs special

Several teams will have some special events this season with newcomer Linden Hall among them. The Lady Lions will open their season Aug. 26 in the ‚ÄúPlay for the Cure‚Äù tournament at Phoenixville. The tournament raises money for the Phoenixville Hospital Cancer Center.

Conestoga Valley under Dale Gregg coaching in his 37th year for the third year will collect old/practice tennis balls to recycle. Gregg‚Äôs program is one that is a no-cut team ‚Äúso introducing players to the lifetime sport of tennis continues to be a priority.‚Äù Gregg noted in an email. He has 37 players on this year‚Äôs team.

Another no-cut program is McCaskey where coach Delaine Mast said she has her biggest turnout in years with 21 players.

When BART and Supervisor Hillary Ronen had those fences put up around the 24th and Mission plaza in late July in an attempt to curb illegal street vending the fences were supposed to stay up for 60 days while a vendor permitting process was put in place. On that announced timeline the fences were scheduled to stay up until late September.

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

They didn‚Äôt make it that long! SFist observed early Saturday afternoon that the fences have been suddenly torn down from the northeast corner of 24th and Mission Streets. (The fences were still up at the time of this Friday Chronicle report from the previous afternoon.)

We cannot confirm with certainty who removed the fences though an SFPD officer on the scene later Saturday afternoon told SFist it was ""protesters."" Further a collective called SF Mission DeFence promoted some sort of action there in the lead-up and has posted videos of their Saturday morning skirmishes with both SFPD and BART Police.

As seen above in a Friday Instagram post the timing coincides with an ‚ÄúAll Day Saturday‚Äù action of ‚ÄúGrass Roots Community Outreach‚Äù to ‚ÄúCome out and Support the Plaza vendors and the Mission community.‚Äù

A (now deleted) Saturday morning post from just after 8 a.m. declares ‚ÄúShow up right now at 24th and mission if you can to hold down the liberated space!‚Äù While that post has since been deleted SFist has a screenshot of it above.

Screenshot via Instagram Post Now Deleted

The above Instagram post from around 9 a.m. Saturday (also now deleted) showed a six-minute confrontation with BART Police. The fences had already been removed at the point this was filmed which may be why BART Police are there. DPW personnel could be seen in the background of the now-deleted video cleaning up the aftermath of well something.

‚ÄúThe community doesn't want this fence here‚Äù a protester can be heard telling an officer. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just basically a white man that just gives a fuck more about his job to come record some Black and Brown people.‚Äù

That same protester also adds the gems that ‚ÄúThese motherfuckers are just the epitomacy of white supremacy‚Äù and ‚ÄúThese are rent-a-cops too so they‚Äôre not even real fucking pigs.‚Äù

Screenshot via Instagram Post Now Deleted

Another Instagram video from later Saturday (stop me if you've heard this before ‚Äî now deleted) showed a confrontation with SFPD. It was basically just ten minutes of protesters yelling at SFPD.

But at the end of those ten minutes one of the protesters addressed a female SFPD officer by saying ‚ÄúShe thinks she‚Äôs a man‚Äù and ‚Äúa woman should never be walking around with a damn gun and a uniform."" When he added that she should be ‚Äúbarefoot and pregnant‚Äù the videographer cut the video perhaps realizing this was not their most winning message.

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

We have more indications that the removal of fences may have been related to a protest in a set of flyers posted around the station in both English and Spanish. ‚ÄúNo Fence No Walls No Borders No Cops!‚Äù the flyers say. They also decry the vendor permitting legislation by saying ‚ÄúSupervisor Hillary Ronen is working with the city funded non-profit organization known as ‚ÄòCalle 24‚Äô to kick vendors out of our shared community space (the 24th St. BART Plaza.)‚Äù

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

‚ÄúWe will not sit by quietly while the City treats (housed & unhoused) residents vendors & workers who use the plaza every day like a nuisance to be swept up into its squad cars & jails‚Äù the flyer notes in their call to action. ‚ÄúVendors have a right to sell to survive to thrive in the spaces we all share.‚Äù

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

Notably the fencing was not removed at the southwest corner of Mission and 24th Street and the corner remains unaffected by Saturday‚Äôs activity.

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

Whereas on the northeast corner of 24th and Mission Streets the fences and barriers are all still there just no longer standing. They seem stacked in a fairly organized fashion which may or may not have been the work of DPW earlier in the day. There was no DPW SFPD or BART Police presence when SFist took these images shortly after noon Saturday.

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

But the larger issue is that the plaza is back open for now at least on the northeast corner. Whatever your feelings about this it has to be a relief for people using wheelchairs strollers and walkers as the fencing had very much limited their mobility.

Image: Joe Kukura SFist

Parenthetically Saturday is also seeing another of those recurring Lowrider Cruise events on Mission Street. These events now are fully sanctioned and permitted. The foot traffic they bring is also a great boon for the small businesses on Mission Street despite the outlaw origins of Lowrider culture decades ago.

And this presents an interesting contrast in the current culture of Mission Street itself in terms of what is currently being sanctioned and welcomed and what is not.

This is a developing story and SFist will provide updates if the situation changes.

In a memo sent to employees on Friday the retail giant said its healthcare plans will cover abortion for employees ‚Äúwhen there is a health risk to the mother rape or incest ectopic pregnancy miscarriage or lack of fetal viability‚Äù. The plans will be ‚Äúeffective immediately‚Äù the memo added.

The company‚Äôs benefits plan had previously covered abortion only in cases ‚Äúwhen the health of the mother would be in danger if the fetus were carried to term the fetus could not survive the birthing process or death would be imminent after birth‚Äù according to a copy of the policy viewed by the Associated Press but not confirmed by Walmart.

Walmart‚Äôs chief people officer Donna Morris said in the memo to staff that the new policy will also offer ‚Äútravel support‚Äù for workers seeking abortions covered under its healthcare plans ‚Äì as well as their dependents ‚Äì so they can access services that are not available within 100 miles of their locations.

‚ÄúGiven how recent events are resulting in state-by-state healthcare environments we will expand our travel coverage‚Äù the memo said.

Walmart employs nearly 1.6 million people in the US. The company is headquartered in Arkansas where abortion is banned under all circumstances unless the procedure is needed to protect the life of the mother in a medical emergency. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.

That means under the revised policy Walmart employees can travel out of the state ‚Äì or any other state that bans abortion for rape and incest ‚Äì to obtain the procedure through the retailer‚Äôs health plans.

According to the memo which CNN also reviewed Morris said that Walmart decided to make the changes after ‚Äúlistening to our associates about what‚Äôs important to them‚Äù adding that ‚Äúwe strive to provide quality competitive and accessible health coverage that supports you and your families‚Äù.

The company said it will also launch a center that provides employees fertility services including in vitro fertilization. Additionally it vowed to add surrogacy support and increase its financial aid for adoptions from $5000 to $20000. In June Walmart said it would expand its offering of doulas ‚Äì or people who assist women during pregnancies ‚Äì to address racial disparities in maternal care.

Some other large companies ‚Äì including Meta American Express and Bank of America ‚Äì have said they will cover travel costs for their employees in the aftermath of the high court ruling that tossed out the federal abortion rights established by the landmark decision in the 1973 case titled Roe v Wade including elective abortions. But a Walmart spokesperson did not immediately reply for a request for comment on whether any of the company‚Äôs revised policy will cover elective abortions as well.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a step in the right direction but it‚Äôs simply not far enough for a company that employs that many women‚Äù said Bianca Agustin director of the corporate accountability program for United for Respect a group that advocates for Walmart workers. She said the organization will be incorporating ‚Äúsafe abortions‚Äù for employees in their list of demands pressing the company for better pay and benefits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL3dhbG1hcnQtYWJvcnRpb24tYmFuLWFya2Fuc2FzLXJvZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart expands abortion coverage for staff after Roe overturned,"Walmart is expanding its employee health-care plans to cover more situations in which its staff might seek an abortion  making the nation‚Äôs largest private employer the latest firm to offer enhanced access to reproductive health services after Roe v.

A source close to the situation told Insider that DoorDash notified Walmart about its decision earlier this month citing that the partnership ‚Äúwas no longer mutually beneficial‚Äù and that it wants to ‚Äúfocus on its long-term customer relationships.‚Äù

DoorDash reportedly gave Walmart a 30-day notice which means the partnership will officially end in September. The two companies first teamed up in 2018 when Walmart started testing having groceries ordered through its site delivered by DoorDash. It went live in Atlanta Georgia to start but has since expanded to several other states.

‚ÄúWe have agreed to part ways with DoorDash‚Äù Walmart spokesperson Leigh Stidham said in an emailed statement to The Verge. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd like to thank DoorDash for their partnership and support of our customers the past several years.‚Äù DoorDash didn‚Äôt immediately respond to The Verge‚Äôs request for comment.

Walmart has been busy building out its own delivery service platform

It‚Äôs unclear whether DoorDash will offer deliveries from Walmart via its app though. DoorDash currently doesn‚Äôt let you order from Walmart presumably to avoid any conflicts with the service it offers through Walmart‚Äôs website. DoorDash rival Instacart on the other hand offers same-day deliveries from Walmart in some areas.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôd like to thank Walmart for their partnership and are looking forward to continuing to build and provide support for merchants in the years ahead with our leading Marketplace and Platform offerings‚Äù DoorDash spokesperson Ali Musa said in a statement to The Verge.

DoorDash and Walmart‚Äôs split isn‚Äôt all that surprising. Walmart has been busy building out its own delivery service platform Spark which hands off grocery deliveries to its own database of gig workers similar to the way Lyft and Uber operate. Walmart told Insider that Spark accounts for 75 percent of its deliveries and services 84 percent of households in the US. Last year Walmart also announced that it‚Äôs also working on a white label delivery service called GoLocal to handle last-mile logistics and deliveries for other businesses.

According to the report nearly 40% of high-income and middle-income shoppers purchase private-label items.

Numerator also found that Walmart owns four of the top five private brands. Ranked by household penetration Numerator reports the top five private brands to include Walmart‚Äôs Great Value purchased by 72.7% of the U.S. population; Equate which has a 52% market share; Marketside at 44.2%; and Fresh Guaranteed at 40% market penetration. Dollar Tree ranked fifth for its private brand market share at 32.5%.

While Walmart holds a significant lead over its competitors with private brand market share Numerator found Aldi Target and Amazon are gaining ground with their private brand reach. In 2020 Amazon had grown its private brand business to include 45 different labels offering 243000 items across a wide range of categories such as AmazonBasics apparel which the company launched in 2005.

In mid-July Amazon announced plans to reduce the number of private brands it sells because of weak sales. Analysts said Amazon has been evaluating its private brand sales over the past year under the leadership of new CEO Dave Clark. Amazon is expected to reduce the scale of its private brands by as much as 50% in its U.S. business.

‚ÄúWe continue to invest in this area just as our many retail competitors have done for decades and continue to do today‚Äù Amazon stated.

Numerator reports AmazonBasics saw its market share grow 1.7% in the second quarter of this year. While Amazon captures a higher private label share among its consumer electronics and home goods products the retailer posts a private label share of only 3% among grocery household and health and beauty products.

Target‚Äôs private-label market share for grocery household health and beauty is 15.1% Whole Foods Market is 14.7% and Publix is 13.6%. That compares to more than 60% for Walmart‚Äôs market share in those categories. Numerator reports Target‚Äôs Favorite Day brand market share increased 2.2% in the second quarter second only to Aldi‚Äôs 2.3% market share growth in the same period Numerator reports.

MEMBER‚ÄôS MARK GAINS

Sam‚Äôs Club reduced the number of its private brands in recent years and worked to grow the market share of its Member‚Äôs Mark brand. Numerator said Member Mark‚Äôs market share rose 1.3% in the second quarter. Member‚Äôs Mark represents 30% of total sales at Sam‚Äôs Club equal to $22.08 billion. Sam‚Äôs Club has also worked to make its Member‚Äôs Mark brand more attractive to consumers according to Sam‚Äôs Club CEO Kath McLay. During the retailer‚Äôs shareholder events in June she told the media that Member‚Äôs Mark aspires to be brand customers ‚Äúmust have‚Äù because they trust the quality and value.

Since 2017 Sam‚Äôs has grown the value of its Member‚Äôs Mark by more than 100% and it remains the top preferred brand on SamsClub.com the company said. Company leadership said the successful growth of Member‚Äôs Mark is more than added sales. It‚Äôs also about creating a solid asset and loyalty base for the retailer‚Äôs overall business.

Sam‚Äôs said it is evaluating the Member‚Äôs Mark assortment and adhering to and developing high standards for every new item. McLay said that the item is either improved or abandoned if members are not impressed.

Costco is at the top of the list among retailers that have somewhat perfected private brands. Its iconic brand Kirkland represents 33.5% of Costco‚Äôs sales and the brand is worth more than $75 billion.

Scott Benedict a former buyer for Sam‚Äôs Club and now executive at Rogers marketing agency WhyteSpyder said a strong private brand could be a real differentiator. Benedict applauds the work Sam‚Äôs Club has done with its Member‚Äôs Mark brand which excelled early in consumable items but has recently made a name for itself in higher-margin general merchandise and apparel. He said the Kirkland Signature brand is an example of that for Costco. Amazon has also made headway with the AmazonBasics brand now the best seller on Amazon.com.

CONSUMER SENTIMENT

While many retailers have invested in private brands in recent years Aldi sits at the top for the share of private brand sales relative to all sales at 77.5%. Numerator said 82.6% of items sold during the second quarter at Aldi were private brands. According to Numerator Aldi‚Äôs parent company Trader Joe‚Äôs is also a private brand destination with 59.4% of sales being from the 56.9% of house brands it offers.

Wegmans was third for its share of market share spend in the second quarter at 49.4%. Roughly half of the units sold at Wegmans in the period were private brands. Costco and Sam‚Äôs Club ranked fourth and fifth with a 33.5% and 30% share of spend respectively in the second quarter.

Texas-based grocery giant H-E-B was sixth with private brands being 26.9% share of spend in the quarter. About one in every three items sold at H-E-B in the second quarter was a private brand. Walmart has similar results as the seventh largest share of private brands spend at 23.3%. Numerator said that every 23 out of 100 items Walmart sold in the second quarter was a private brand.

There has been an uptick in recent months among consumers who say the price is more important than the brand name particularly among low-income consumers. Overall sentiment regarding private labels‚Äô value for money has stayed relatively consistent over the past couple of years with over half of consumers (55%) rating its value for money excellent or above average Numerator noted in the report.

The report found that 38% of consumers said they purchase private brands to save money 32% of those were from low-income households and 40% were from middle-income families. Roughly 30% of low-income households and 27% of middle-income households said private brand quality has improved over time.

Let's talk about weather - especially those super steamy hot summer days that so many of us have experienced recently.

How hot is too hot for you to consider visiting a theme park? I mentioned Disney in the headline since Walt Disney World and Disneyland remain America's top theme park resort destinations. But let's consider any theme park for the purpose of today's vote which you will see below.

Many years ago summer was the undisputed high season at the Disney theme parks. Sure the very biggest crowds hit during the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's Day but the summer brought consistently large crowds to all the Disney World parks and Disneyland.

These days spring break at Walt Disney World and the fall at Disneyland often deliver crowds as big and sometimes bigger than you find during the summer vacation months. Now part of that is due to the overall growth in attendance at Disney and the fact that the crowds had to spill over somewhere. But many of us who visit the parks frequently especially at Disneyland have suspected that summer crowds are not quite as big as they once were.

Over the past couple of years Disney's new reservation system surely has played a part in that shift. But we were seeing weakening summer attendance at Disneyland before the pandemic. Could hotter summer weather be playing into a seasonal shift among theme park visitation?

Regional parks always have prospered and suffered with the weather. With fewer people planning long-distance trips to them regional parks rely on good weather to help inspire locals to come out and enjoy the day. Traditionally it's been rain that has done the most to deter visits but heat definitely can keep visitors at home or looking for air-conditioned alternatives instead.

And in California let's not forget that smoke from the wildfires that often accompany dry summer heatwaves also has a profound affect on people's willingness to spend the day outside such as at Disneyland.

I am curious to hear how you factor heat into your theme park plans. How hot is ""too hot"" varies by person of course. Spending the day out in temperatures in even the high 70s to low 80s (F) can lead to heat exhaustion for some visitors. But with the right precautions and care many visitors and employees can get through a day with temperatures in the 90s and even beyond.

I know that some people will want to talk about humidity and its effect on how hot it feels on a given day. But at a certain point the lack of humidity no longer matters in avoiding discomfort and danger.

While 90F and humid feels a lot worse than 90F with lower humidity moisture in the air can serve to limit how hot a day can get. You rarely see days up in the 100s in Florida where the mix of high heat and humidity often triggers thunderstorms that serve as a brake on runaway heat. In the west however lower humidity can allow the temperature to soar into the 100s. That's nasty and dangerous for anyone even if it is a so-called ""dry heat.""

For our vote below please select the option that best describes your feeling about dealing with heat and theme parks. (Remember that votes on Theme Park Insider are completely anonymous.)

In the comments we would love to hear some details about how this summer's weather may or may not have affected your theme park plans if you care to share. As always thank you for reading Theme Park Insider.

Some Guests found themselves in an unlucky position when the rain started ‚Äì on board the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover at Magic Kingdom.

This trend continued at Disneyland Paris with the Resort facing harsh temperatures and even harsher storms leaving both Parks completely underwater. However None of the Disney Parks seem to have as brutal weather as the Walt Disney World Resort faces on a regular basis with high temperatures and brutal humidity beating down on Guests daily.

Recently the Walt Disney World Resort faced some intense storms accompanied by lightning strikes. Several Guests were able to capture photos of the strikes and the results are unbelievable.

Hospitality Professional and Director of Revenue Management Scott Campbell (@scottcampbell) shared a few pictures of the storms with one photo in particular actually showing lightning that nearly struck them as they rode the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover. You can see the full suite of photos linked below:

This was some insane storm over the Magic Kingdom today. Had one bolt strike right next to me as you can see if you zoom in on the first pic.

Hopefully the weather clears up soon and Guests won‚Äôt have to worry about rain or lightning while exploring the Disney Parks for the remainder of the summer!

For fans of Warner Media‚Äôs animation slate a good chunk of series including 200 Sesame Street episodes and cult classic shows like Infinity Train and OK KO were yanked from the streaming service earlier in the week. In some cases such as Summer Camp Island the series were preparing to debut new seasons that now just won‚Äôt air. (Per the AV Club Cartoon Network will air the final season of Summer Camp Island along with the new season of Victor & Valentino sometime in the near future.) While some of these shows can be seen on other services the creators and employees of those shows straight up weren‚Äôt aware of what was going on until the removals were on the cusp of happening.

No matter how one wishes to slice it and even before you learn that it‚Äôs allegedly being done in the name of saving money on residuals WBD‚Äôs decision just comes across as needlessly cruel. Several of these shows were specifically made for HBO Max and as such lack physical releases or legal ways to watch them. Going so far as to wipe any trace of these shows from other social media channels and prevent related media from being experienced is just twisting the knife.

It‚Äôs especially damning because in several respects animation is Warner Bros. Whether one grew up on Looney Toons the Powerpuff Girls or Steven Universe WB‚Äôs slate of cartoons and films are a big part of western animation. Cartoon Network‚Äôs had arguably the best lineup of animated shows for decades and they‚Äôve always been pretty good about calling back to their history while looking forward. Cartoon Network is turning 30 years old in a couple of months but it hardly feels like a time to celebrate when it has this current stink around it to say nothing of if the new shows and animated films that were previously announced for Warner Media actually still exist under this new regime. And it‚Äôs not a good sign if even the DC animated slate is getting caught in the crossfire when those things have generally been allowed to do their own thing.

Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs bloodbath will more than likely continue through the rest of the year depressing as it sounds. It sucks that as the animation industry was making strides to being recognized as a vital part of the entertainment machine especially as it wasn‚Äôt kneecapped by the pandemic like live-action productions were that CEO David Zaslav has such contempt for the company he bought. We‚Äôve known for years that mergers are bad but more than previous instances what‚Äôs happening to Warner Bros. has really emphasized how bad it is for corporations to have control of everything.

Discovery for Removing Animated Series,"After cruelly pulling the plug on Batgirl and the animated feature Scoob!: Holiday Haunt Warner Bros. Discovery is removing several beloved animated series from HBO Max. OK K.O! Let‚Äôs Be Heroes Close Enough Infinity Train Aquaman: King of Atlantis Uncle Grandpa The Fungies and Summer Camp Island are among the titles that have been discarded without warning. The mass removals are the result of the Warner Bros. merger with Discovery and new CEO David Zaslav who is consolidating both studios resulting in cancelled series massive layoffs and a confusing future for HBO Max content. And while it‚Äôs disappointing for fans it‚Äôs devastating for the series creators and animators who have spent their blood sweat and tears on these projects over the years.

Recommended Videos

Infinity Train creator Owen Dennis responded to the situation via his blog ‚ÄúOwen Dennis‚Äôs Infinite Train of Thought‚Äù  where he discussed how the abrupt removal affects the artists and creators of these series. He notes that none of the creators or showrunners were warned that their series were getting kicked off the platform. He wrote ‚ÄúThe announcement on Wednesday of Infinity Train OKKO Summer Camp Island The Fungies and many other shows being taken off of HBOMax was a shock to all of us. Not just to fans but to the creators and artists that made the shows as well. I had no idea it was coming neither did any other show creator I‚Äôve talked with nor any of their representatives.‚Äù

He adds that the removal was supposed to happen next week giving Cartoon Network time to inform the series creators. That obviously didn‚Äôt happen which is a massive betrayal of trust from the network‚Äôs overlords. ‚ÄúCartoon Network warned them not to do this as it would hurt relationships with creators and talent but they clearly do not care what any of this looks like publicly much less about how we feel about it.‚Äù

Dennis then gets at the reason for the series removals and it comes down to money. WBD is looking to save money via residuals payments which artists and writers are entitled to for the life of the series. And while there is payment up front for this kind of work many artists rely on residuals to survive. Dennis explains ‚ÄúOur pay is not complete without the ongoing residuals. Those residuals aren‚Äôt paid directly to the artists they actually go to our union to pay for our healthcare. So not paying artists residuals on their work means they are indirectly defunding our healthcare.‚Äù

Residual payments add up to a scant amount of money saved for the studio but its crucial financial support for the artists. Cutting series to save on residuals is a cruel and unnecessary step that screws over writers and artists who are already facing a pay gap with live-action writers. Dennis summed up his view point writing ‚ÄúI think the way that Discovery went about this is incredibly unprofessional rude and just straight up slimy. I think most everyone who makes anything feels this way. Across the industry talent is mad agents are mad lawyers and managers are mad even execs at these companies are mad. I can‚Äôt think of a single person who works in animation and entertainment that when you bring this all up doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are they doing? How do they plan to have anyone ever want to work with them again?‚Äù‚Äù

Many creators agreed with Dennis sharing their heartbreak and dismay on social media:

HBOMax just wiped all 3 seasons of Close Enough in a matter of seconds. I watched my partner pour 5 years of himself his love sweat pain & pride into its development & creation helping JG create a funny tender surreal loving show. ‚Äî HELLEN JO Ï°∞ÌòúÎ†® (@helllllen) August 20 2022

I've barely worked anywhere else in my 13 years in animation. I learned everything I know from working on Regular Show and Close Enough. CN feels like home. I'm just so unbelievably bummed out. ‚Äî Calvin Wong (@calwong) August 18 2022

We worked for 5 years to make 100 episodes of animation. We worked late into the night we let ourselves go we were a family of hard working artists who wanted to make something beautiful and HBO MAX just pulled them all like we were nothing. Animation is not nothing! ‚Äî Julia Pott (@juliapott) August 18 2022

Remember when the promise of streaming was an endless library where even niche shows would be watchable forever? Now b/c of the merger HBO Max is DELETING dozens of shows just to save $ on taxes and residuals. A needless shameful waste. https://t.co/LPaKNkT6Ao ‚Äî Adam Conover (@adamconover) August 19 2022

cool love to work on something for literal years and then have it totally vanish it's extremely good that TV writing has become building sand castles at high tide https://t.co/BmMJ1Xigqy ‚Äî Aaron Burdette (@AaronBurdette) August 18 2022

The Yakama Nation is on a quest to rescue it,"Trina Sherwood gazes out at the Hanford nuclear site as she speeds across the Columbia river in a small motorboat. More than 500 sq miles large and ringed by rocky mountains the decommissioned nuclear production site is considered one of the most contaminated places in North America.

It also sits on the ancestral lands of the Yakama Nation and other Indigenous peoples in Washington state. Here precious wildlife vision quest sites and burial grounds lie side-by-side with signs reading ‚Äúwarning hazardous area‚Äù and towering nuclear reactors some of which date back to the second world war.

There‚Äôs Gable Mountain where young men would fast and pray explained Sherwood a cultural specialist for the Yakama Nation‚Äôs Environmental Restoration/Waste Management (ER/WM) program. There‚Äôs Locke Island where an Indigenous village once stood and the towering White Bluffs where Native people collected white paint for ceremonies. There are also outcroppings of tules which were used to make mats for ceremonies and tipis as well as yarrow root which was known to treat burns.

The Hanford nuclear site was established in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project and over the next four decades produced nearly two-thirds of the plutonium for the US‚Äôs nuclear weapons supply including the bomb dropped on Nagasaki.

During its lifespan hundreds of billions of gallons of liquid waste were dumped in underground storage tanks or simply straight into the ground. After the site‚Äôs nine nuclear reactors were shut down by 1987 about 56m gallons of radioactive waste were left behind in 177 large underground tanks ‚Äì two of which are currently leaking ‚Äì alongside a deeply scarred landscape.

In the decades since the Yakama Nation has been one of four local Indigenous communities dedicated to the cleanup of this historic landscape. For the Yakama Nation that has meant tireless environmental and cultural oversight advocacy and outreach with the hope that one day the site will be restored to its natural state opening the doors to a long-awaited unencumbered homecoming.

Today their outreach work has reached a fever pitch. There are few Yakama Nation elders still alive who remember the area before its transformation and there are likely decades to go before cleanup is complete. So members are racing to pass on the site‚Äôs history to the next generation in the hopes they can one day take over.

They didn‚Äôt have time to pack up anything. They just had to leave and they were never told why and how long they were going to be gone LaRena Sohappy

‚ÄúOur elders are leaving that have that historical knowledge; people that actually lived there during that time and can tell you stories about the area‚Äù said Laurene Contreras administrator for ER/WM the program responsible for the Yakama Nation‚Äôs Hanford work. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important for us to make sure that we‚Äôre carrying that message forward.‚Äù

‚ÄòReligious and moral duty‚Äô

Yakama Nation history on the Hanford site dates back to pre-colonization when people would spend the winter here fishing for sturgeon salmon and lamprey in the Columbia River as well as gathering and trading with other families. In 1855 the Nation ceded over 11m acres of land to the US which included the Hanford area and signed a treaty that relegated them to a reservation while allowing the right to continue fishing hunting and gathering roots and berries at ‚Äúall usual and accustomed places‚Äù.

But in the 1940‚Äôs the situation shifted dramatically when the area was cleared out to make room for the construction of nuclear reactors.

LaRena Sohappy 83 vice-chairwoman for Yakama Nation General Council whose father was a well-known medicine man grew up in Wapato about 40 miles from Hanford. She said she remembers the strawberry fields that lined the Hanford site her family gathering Skolkol a root and daily food and traveling to the area for ceremonies.

Her cousin‚Äôs family who lived close to Hanford were woken in the middle of the night and forced to leave to make way for the nuclear site she recalled

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt have time to pack up anything‚Äù said Sohappy. ‚ÄúThey just had to leave and they were never told why and how long they were going to be gone.‚Äù

The effort to give Indigenous people a voice in Hanford‚Äôs fate was forged in part by Russell Jim a member of Yakama Nation‚Äôs council whose work has been credited with helping to keep Hanford from becoming a permanent ‚Äúdeep geologic repository‚Äù a place where high-level nuclear waste from this site and others across the country would be stored.

‚ÄúFrom time immemorial we have known a special relationship with Mother Earth‚Äù Jim who died in 2018 said in a statement to the US Senate in 1980. ‚ÄúWe have a religious and moral duty to help protect Mother Earth from acts which may be a detriment to generations of all mankind.‚Äù

Today the ER/WM program which was founded in the early 1980‚Äôs with Jim at the helm includes such staff as a biologist ecologist and archeologist. It‚Äôs funded by the US Department of Energy (DoE) which operates the Hanford site and leads the cleanup process under an agreement with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Washington state department of ecology.

The Yakama Nation program‚Äôs focus is on accelerating a thorough cleanup of the site protecting culturally significant resources and assessing the threats to wildlife and water.

The area around Hanford is considered the last free-flowing section of the Columbia River. There‚Äôs a major spawning site for Chinook salmon and all along this section of the waterway sturgeon live all year round explained Phil Rigdon Yakama Nation acting Tribal Administrative Director.

‚ÄúOur people we‚Äôre fish people we‚Äôre salmon people in the Columbia River ‚Ä¶ So for us that was a priority‚Äù he said.

Chemicals including mercury which can damage the brain kidneys and heart and PCBs which can cause cancer have been found in the river and could be ingested when eating fish according to a 2017 advisory. For the Hanford Reach a 150-mile section of the river that runs through Hanford it suggests limiting consuming some fish to four or fewer times a month.

In the past decade it was also discovered that hundreds of gallons of highly radioactive waste have been leaking from two Hanford tanks threatening the Columbia River.

McClure Tosch a Natural Resource Injury Assessment lead for ER/WM said recently Yakama Nation has played a key role in developing a plan for the EPA to monitor the basin including fish tissue.

ER/WM has also been advocating for the federal government to test the wells at Hanford near the Columbia River for PFAS long-lasting chemicals that can be found in an array of commercial and industrial products. If found Tosch said that could be a huge concern for the local drinking water. The energy department said in a statement: ‚ÄúInformation-gathering about the occurrence and use of PFAS at DoE sites is ongoing‚Äù.

There has also been a focus by the Yakama Nation to preserve culturally significant plants. Most recently Sherwood has been overseeing the protection of a bright yellow plant known as Umtanum desert buckwheat. It has long been known as a medicinal plant for the local Indigenous people and today Hanford is the only place in the world where it is documented as growing.

A ‚Äòpush and pull‚Äô effect

Despite the sometimes glacial nature of the federal government‚Äôs work the Yakama Nation have scored some important wins.

Recently the ER/WM succeeded in amending a cleanup proposal for an area next to the Columbia River containing nuclear reactors ensuring it will include a review of the impact on local aquatic insects. And in the coming months Tosch says the tribe will work with the federal government to assess the effectiveness of a polyphosphate injection to sequester uranium found in Hanford‚Äôs groundwater; an approach the tribe has questioned.

ER/WM staff have also pushed back against a federal government change in how high-level radioactive waste is classified which could downgrade some of Hanford‚Äôs waste ultimately preventing it from being removed from the site as expected. The energy department said they don‚Äôt plan to move forward with this new interpretation without first meeting with local Indigenous Nations.

For their part both DoE and EPA said their representatives meet with Yakama Nation regularly about Hanford and have benefitted from their‚Äôs and other local Indigenous Nations‚Äô expertise and input.

But Brian Stickney DoE‚Äôs deputy manager for the Hanford Site said in a statement that while Yakama Nation wants to see the lands returned to a pre-nuclear state DoE is focused on regulatory requirements and protecting treaty rights.

The Washington state department of ecology which helps to oversee the Hanford cleanup and whose officials meet with the Yakama Nation at least once a month described their relationship with the tribal Nation as a bit ‚Äúpush and pull‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe are the regulators and sometimes Yakama Nation would like us to push a little harder than they perceive us doing‚Äù said Laura Watson its director. ‚ÄúAnd so there‚Äôs a little bit of that push and pull. And that‚Äôs fine that‚Äôs actually important as a regulator to have folks pushing.‚Äù

We have a religious and moral duty to help protect Mother Earth from acts which may be a detriment to generations of all mankind Russell Jim

‚ÄòFor our children not yet born‚Äô

A fully rehabilitated Hanford site likely won‚Äôt happen within the lifetime of Yakama Nation‚Äôs elders or even the generation that follows. So they‚Äôre working diligently to bring in younger tribal members to the effort.

In recent years they‚Äôve held coloring contests a mass postcard mailing campaign and visited local schools explained Samantha Redheart who coordinates Stem programs for ER/WM. They‚Äôve also offered college scholarships for students studying such subjects as engineering and science in the hopes that the recipients may one day bring that knowledge back to the community.

‚ÄúWe always share that Hanford is a multi-generational cleanup site‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYakama Nation leaders and management are always looking into not just the cleanup today but for our future generations and of our children that are not yet born.‚Äù

22 high school students were allowed to visit Hanford in 2016 - a rare opportunity explains Redheart as those under 16 are typically not allowed on most of the site. She said they took them to a series of culturally important sites pointing out traditional cultural artifacts and salmon spawning grounds. But the experience was thoroughly regimented involving energy department staff hazmat guides and strict timelines.

If Sohappy had her way sharing her knowledge of Hanford before it was a nuclear site with the next generation would involve something of a trip back in time. She would take them on wagons and horses to each of the important sites making sure to point out where the strawberry fields and old town once stood.

It‚Äôs difficult to know whether that will ever be a reality. She herself hasn‚Äôt been to Hanford in over a decade.

‚ÄúIt angers me that I can‚Äôt go where my dad used to wander around‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing there that‚Äôs pleasurable. Not anymore anyway.

The garbage collection was disrupted after the locals from Sisdol and Banchare Danda obstructed the transportation of garbage time and again.

""If locals do not obstruct garbage transportation and the road to reach the landfill site remains normal it would take 10 days to complete the garbage management"" said Sunil Lamsal a member of Mayor Shaha's Secretariat.

Lamsal stated that 8000 tippers of garbage from 18 local levels of the Kathmandu Valley need to be managed for now. Once the work of management resumes at a normal pace it would take at least 10 days to dispose of the garbage accumulated so far in Kathmandu Valley. Chief district Officers from Kathmandu Dhading and Nuwakot and locals from Sisdol and Banchare Danda had signed a four-point agreement which paved the way for easing the garbage management.

As per the agreement the tippers transporting the garbage must not leak the liquid waste while reaching the landfill site. Currently there are only 75 tippers with Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) which are not leaky. They transport the waste twice a day.

KMC is planning to take in rent 150 more tippers so that the way that leads to landfill sites would not be littered with liquid waste added Lamsal. The garbage collection has begun after the agreement. KMC has further planned to use 300 tippers to collect and manage the valley waste.

The embattled large bank Wells Fargo (WFC 1.02%) has really been down and out since its phony-accounts scandal came to light in 2016. That resulted in numerous lawsuits and fines as well as a lot of work to repair the bank's reputation and regulatory infrastructure.

But after bringing on Wall Street veteran Charlie Scharf in 2019 to run the bank Wells Fargo has undeniably started to make progress with the stock more than doubling since its pandemic lows in late 2020. It currently trades with around a $172 billion market cap; can the bank get to $1 trillion over the next decade? Let's take a look.

What needs to happen

Following revelations of the phony-accounts scandal in which employees at the bank opened credit card and depository accounts for customers without their consent the Federal Reserve imposed an asset cap on the bank in 2018 limiting balance-sheet growth.

More than four years later the cap is still in place and has cost the bank billions of dollars in profits at a minimum. Clearly for Wells Fargo to grow as it can and really start to generate strong returns it needs the asset cap to be removed.

It seems like the asset cap could still remain for a while given that the bank has nine outstanding consent orders and Scharf has said that you can partially track the bank's progress by looking at how the consent orders start to expire or get terminated. But getting the asset cap removed is Wells Fargo's top priority and management does seem to be making progress; I'd expect the bank to be able to get the cap removed within the next few years. Once it is removed Wells Fargo will be able to trim more costs and grow revenue faster which will accelerate profits from the current pace.

Even with the asset cap in place Scharf has formed a plan to cut out $10 billion of annual costs a process that is now well underway...and working. This along with higher interest rates can help the bank get a lot more efficient and drive much better returns. Scharf has said the goal is to exit this year with a run rate of a 10% return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) and then reach 15% as more of a medium-term goal. Asset cap or no asset cap the bank is improving and making strides toward much better financial results.

The path to $1 trillion

Banks tend to trade relative to their tangible book value (TBV or net worth) so the faster they can grow TBV the better. Top banks in Wells Fargo's peer group like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America can reach 200% or 250% of their TBV in good times. When the asset cap wasn't in place Wells Fargo was growing TBV at a fast clip:

Between 2012 and now even with the asset cap Wells Fargo still grew its TBV by about 68%.

That's pretty good considering we know the asset cap has cost the bank billions in profits. Scharf is also building out what could be a much more profitable bank by focusing growth on areas like credit card lending and investment banking. His cost-cutting initiatives will also bolster profits as well.

If the bank could generate a 15% ROTCE and consistently produce that for nine or 10 years then Wells Fargo could in theory grow its tangible book value to somewhere close to $500 billion by 2032 if you figure in compounded growth. And then if the bank could trade at 200% or 250% of its TBV like other top banks then it could have somewhere near a $1 trillion market cap.

Will it happen?

Obviously there are many factors at play here like when Wells Fargo gets the asset cap removed and can really start to grow the balance sheet and get its returns closer to a 15% ROTCE. Wells Fargo still has a strong franchise and I have confidence in Scharf's ability to execute.

But I think it's likely to take at least two or three years to go from a 10% to a 15% ROTCE. Then maintaining consistent returns over a long period of time will not be easy especially because banks are so linked to the economy and are therefore affected by the broader economic environment and macro policy. Furthermore capital returns to shareholders will also slow the growth of tangible book value.

Ultimately I wouldn't call it impossible for Wells Fargo to achieve a $1 trillion market cap by the year 2032. But I think it's very unlikely given that we don't know when the asset cap will be removed and that there is little room for error for the bank to reach $1 trillion. Still I think that over the next decade Wells Fargo can be a very solid investment that investors should definitely consider.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbGV2aXR0b3dubm93LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzIwL2NoZWNrZXJzLWZhc3QtZm9vZC1yZXN0YXVyYW50LWNvbnZlbmllbmNlLXN0b3JlLWFwcHJvdmVkLWZvci1jcm95ZG9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Checkers Fast-Food Restaurant Convenience Store Approved For Croydon,"A rendering of the proposed Checkers.

Plans for fast-food chain Checkers to open a location in Bristol Township‚Äôs Croydon section were greenlit Thursday evening.

Bristol Township Council approved plans for franchisee ARAR Foods LLC to open a 1200-square-foot Checkers and a joined 2400-square-foot convivence store for the now-closed Wells Fargo branch at 399 Route 13.

The plan calls for remodeling the building and reconstructing it to fit the needs of the fast food joint and convivence store said David Shafkowitz an attorney for ARAR Foods LLC.

The township has approved a waiver for 33 parking spots in place of the 44 required by ordinance.

The Checkers will have a drive-thru lane for customers.

The developer previously told the township would be no indoor seating but there would be a small area for seating outside.

The developer also told officials in the past the site would reduce impervious service of the mostly paved lot by adding some greenery.

Council President Craig Bowen welcomed the businesses to the township and joked that they should bring some treats to public meetings.

Shafkowitz said cleanup of the site could begin in as soon as 10 days.

ARAR Foods LLC has already purchased the bank site for just over $1 million according to county property records.

In the past Checkers operated a location at the corner of Woodbourne and Bristol Oxford Valley roads in the Levittown section of Middletown Township. That location closed in 2013.

The Wells Fargo building was previously owned by Farmers National Bank of Bucks County in the 1950s. Farmers National Bank of Bucks County was purchased by Fidelity Bank in the late 1950s. Through the years and acquisitions the location was a First Union branch a Wachovia and finally a Wells Fargo.

Sahith Theegala was candid. He was sincere. Even after a final-round 68 at the BMW Championship that firmed up his spot in next week‚Äôs Tour Championship as a rookie he said he still doesn‚Äôt feel like he belongs on the PGA Tour.

‚ÄúEven yesterday I was walking up 18 hit my 5-wood in the right rough which is so standard there and I was just ‚Äî I turned to [caddie] Carl [Smith] I was like it‚Äôs incredible how much better I could get and how bad‚Äù Theegala said matter-of-factly Sunday at Wilmington Country Club. ‚ÄúI totally agree some parts of my game have been incredible this year but just playing with some of these guys they are so good and seeing different facets of their game that I feel like I can improve so much more in every area of the game.‚Äù

In a way so rarely seen on the PGA Tour Theegala peeled back the curtain on what emotions he felt with a spot in the Tour Championship on the line.

He started the day on the number projected 30th in the FedEx Cup standings. Top 30 get to play in the Tour Championship and all that comes with it: a berth in all four of next year‚Äôs major championships and the Players Championship and exemptions into the Genesis Invitational Arnold Palmer Invitational and Memorial which will have increased $20 million purses next season. And then there‚Äôs the ridiculous purse for FedEx Cup in which the winner at East Lake takes home $18 million.

Even next week‚Äôs 30th (last) place finisher gets a check for $300k.

Theegala admitted he was feeling the nerves on the morning of the final round.

‚ÄúI had my best friend Roy with me this week and it was cool having him by my side. But I was nervous‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI had a little bit of the shakes warming up. I couldn‚Äôt hold my hands still. I felt great mindset-wise but just body-wise I knew something big was on the line.

He said his birdie on the opening hole helped settle those nerves.

But even Theegala who‚Äôs successful rookie campaign featured a couple of close calls with top-3 finishes at Phoenix and Hartford said the pressure of trying to make a Tour Championship was just as much as trying to win a tournament.

So often we heard this week of pros saying their mindset was take care of business at this tournament and the FedEx Cup standing would take care of itself. On Sunday Theegala might as well have said the opposite.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in 30th place out of 70 people and I‚Äôm as nervous as if I were near the lead‚Äù Theegala said. ‚ÄúIt was definitely different and it definitely felt like a tournament within a tournament. That putt on the last hole just felt so big. It really felt like some of the putts I had made coming down the stretch when I was near the lead there.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt really ever close. His 68 put him at 7-under for the week good for a tie for 15th but seven strokes back of winner Patrick Cantlay. Nevertheless the nerves were still there and that‚Äôs what made the week fun for Theegala.

‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about. The fact that you‚Äôre even in that position to feel nerves is a good thing‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs something I tell a lot of guys is like hey if you‚Äôre nervous that‚Äôs such a good feeling. Imagine not being nervous then what you‚Äôre doing kind of thing. Obviously there‚Äôs a fine line between serious nervousness and anxiety and comfortability and finding that line is tough but yeah just pressure is a privilege and I sure felt that way today.‚Äù

His round couldn‚Äôt have done anything to alleviate any of those nerves. He hit only one fairway but somehow managed 13 greens mostly hitting out of Wilmington Country Club‚Äôs deep rough and made five birdies in order to secure his tie for 15th. Four of those five came in the last seven holes to move from outside the Top-30 in the FedEx Cup to No. 28 in the standings punching his ticket to Atlanta.

But there were notable moments outside of the birdies coming down the stretch.

‚ÄúSixteen it was my bread and butter kind of the low stinger fade that I hit with a 3-iron all year and just squirted right on me and hit a tree like 160 yards off the tee‚Äù Theegala said. ‚ÄúI was just so frustrated there. I was like come on this is the one chance ‚Äî I still hadn‚Äôt hit a fairway to that point so I caught a great lie in the rough.

‚ÄúI had like 210 or 220 to the hole. I was just trying to blast it over the green. Blasted it over the green had a tough lie but knew it was an easy chip so chipped it in there to three feet which was great.‚Äù

Then the crescendo of for Theegala came on after finally finding the fairway for the only time all day.

‚ÄúBest tee shot I‚Äôve hit in a long time. I think I had like 70 yards in. Hit a horrible pitch there. I was like oh great I hit a fairway and now I whiff the wedge‚Äù Theegala said. ‚ÄúBut I just had a good feeling over that putt. I hadn‚Äôt really made any long putts this week and it had a nice look to it and I didn‚Äôt have to hit it too hard because it was a touch downhill and it was just tracking the whole way. I gave a pretty big fist pump which I‚Äôve been holding in for seems like over a month now.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember the last time I fist pumped so that was cool.‚Äù

His 37-footer got him to 7-under for the week the number which would eventually prove critical for him if he could stay there.

He missed the green on 18 and needed to get up and down from short and right of the green.

‚ÄúI felt very comfortable that I‚Äôd get it up-and-down. I didn‚Äôt know how I would‚Äù Theegala said. ‚ÄúBut the fact that it was left to what I feel is the strongest part of my game was fitting. [I] hit a decent chip. I was nervous on that for sure but left myself an easy putt and it was really satisfying to hit my line on that one.‚Äù

He may not have remembered his last fist pump before 17 but it didn‚Äôt take long for his next one after he drained the 7-footer on 18 for par and to get in the clubhouse at 7-under.

However his season is not over and he will play for the $75 million in FedEx Cup bonus money in Atlanta with the rest of the top-30.

‚ÄúI think the validation of the season it‚Äôs another step for me to feel like I really belong because I still don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm really there at the top of the game‚Äù Theegala said. ‚ÄúSlowly building confidence every week whether it‚Äôs a good or bad week. I feel like I‚Äôve made a lot of progress.

‚ÄúIt would mean the world to make the Tour Championship and stand along 29 of the other best golfers in the world.‚Äù

He‚Äôs come along from his initial goal at the start of the season.

‚ÄúThe fact that I‚Äôm even on the PGA Tour is pretty absurd‚Äù Theegala admitted. ‚ÄúMy only expectation was really to keep my card and obviously I‚Äôve blown that out of the water.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZ3cnguY29tLzY5MjMwMi9kZWFuLWJ1cm1lc3Rlci13aXRiLTIwMjItYXVndXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dean Burmester WITB 2022 (August) ‚Äì GolfWRX,"Driver: TaylorMade Qi10 (8 degrees @8.25) Buy here.

You certainly cannot accuse Andre Drummond of selling himself short.

Speaking this week at his ‚ÄúAndre‚Äôs All-Stars‚Äù youth program in Middletown Conn. the new Chicago Bulls big man spoke about his place in NBA history. Drummond said that he believes he is the greatest rebounder of all-time.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm already there‚Äù said Drummond per Mike Anthony of CT Insider. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way. By the time I retire I‚Äôll go down as the best rebounder ever ‚Äî if not already.‚Äù

Drummond who is still only 29 probably has an argument for the greatest rebounder of this generation. He has led the NBA in rebounding four times and has produced three of the six highest-rebounding seasons in the 21st century. But when it comes to all-time Drummond (who has 9519 total rebounds right now) will likely never catch the likes of Wilt Chamberlain (23924) Bill Russell (21620) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (17440).

At the same time Drummond‚Äôs peak campaign of 16.0 rebounds per contest was less than the respective peaks of players such as Dennis Rodman (18.7 a game) Artis Gilmore (17.7) and Moses Malone (17.6). Though Drummond does have a higher career rebounding average (13.3 per game) than any of those guys as well as the highest rebounding percentage of all-time (24.7) he still has the back nine of his career to play with a lot more room to the downside for those numbers.

It is great that Drummond has the confidence in his own abilities especially since he has struggled to fit in during recent years. But his statement here falls flat of the mark considering all the legendary NBA rebounders who came before Drummond did."

In the past ten days subscribers to Instagram and WhatsApp who use two-step authentication for signing into their accounts have reported that they are not receiving the required authentication codes via text message. Text message codes are also required for creating new accounts.

Many suspect that Iran‚Äôs mobile operators are blocking text messages containing keywords including ‚Äúcode‚Äù ‚ÄúTelegram‚Äù ‚ÄúWhatsApp‚Äù and ‚ÄúInstagram‚Äù.

A majority of Iranian lawmakers issued a statement in January asking the government and the Judiciary for measures to restrict peoples‚Äô activities on the internet. In February an ad hoc parliamentary committee approved the outline of a controversial bill ironically titled Legislation to Protect Cyberspace Users‚Äô Rights to limit access to various apps and platforms.

Many Iranians including some lawmakers say the implementation of the plan has practically been in progress in the past few months. Authorities have restricted bandwidth allocated to Instagram in the past few months and reduced Internet speed both of which make connecting to social media platforms difficult.

According to information technology expert Arian Eghbal the recent disruption in access to Instagram and other platforms is deliberate. ‚ÄúThere is evidence that our [filtering] system is working like China‚Äôs‚Äù he told Entekhab news website on August 17.

The slow internet has affected many areas of life from navigation of taxis and cars to tens of thousands of large and small online businesses that rely on Instagram as well as government and public online services.

‚ÄúThey are restricting access to the Internet to make communication between people harder ‚Ä¶ Those who wrote the Siyanat bill don't want people to conjoin in the cyberspace talk to each other and discuss social and political issues‚Äù Gholamreza Nouri-Ghezeljeh chairman of the Independents‚Äô Faction in the parliament told Salam-e No website earlier this month.

Canada-based science and technology reporter Mehdi Sarami told Iran International that the government is quietly implementing the yet unapproved legislation to force people to use domestically developed platforms such as Soroush and Rubika which can easily be controlled.

A survey conducted by the state-run Iranian Students Polling Agency (ISPA) in 2021 found that 73.6% of Iranians over the age of 18 use social media including WhatsApp (64.1) Instagram (45.3) and Telegram (36.3). Only 4.8% reported that they use domestically developed platforms. Many of Instagram‚Äôs subscribers in Iran use it for business.

Instagram with around 45 million users is the only major social media platform not blocked in the country where other platforms such as Facebook YouTube WhatsApp Twitter and Telegram cannot be accessed without the use of anti-filtering software and VPNs (virtual private networks).

Nearly every Iranian with a smartphone has installed anti-filtering software that allows access to filtered applications and websites. Anti-filtering software however will time out if the internet speed is low. Nonetheless with over 50 million users WhatsApp is the most popular messaging application in Iran.

NeuRRAM  a new chip that runs computations directly in memory and can run a wide variety of AI applications has been designed and built by an international team of researchers. What sets it apart is that it does this all at a fraction of the energy consumed by computing platforms for general-purpose AI computing.

The NeuRRAM neuromorphic chip brings AI a step closer to running on a broad range of edge devices disconnected from the cloud. This means they can perform sophisticated cognitive tasks anywhere and anytime without relying on a network connection to a centralized server. Applications for this device abound in every corner of the globe and every facet of our lives. They range from smartwatches to VR headsets smart earbuds smart sensors in factories and rovers for space exploration.

Not only is the NeuRRAM chip twice as energy efficient as the state-of-the-art ‚Äúcompute-in-memory‚Äù chips an innovative class of hybrid chips that runs computations in memory it also delivers results that are just as accurate as conventional digital chips. Conventional AI platforms are much bulkier and typically are constrained to using large data servers operating in the cloud.

Additionally the NeuRRAM chip is highly versatile and supports many different neural network models and architectures. As a result the chip can be used for many different applications including image recognition and reconstruction as well as voice recognition.

‚ÄúThe conventional wisdom is that the higher efficiency of compute-in-memory is at the cost of versatility but our NeuRRAM chip obtains efficiency while not sacrificing versatility‚Äù said Weier Wan the paper‚Äôs first corresponding author and a recent Ph.D. graduate of Stanford University who worked on the chip while at UC San Diego where he was co-advised by Gert Cauwenberghs in the Department of Bioengineering.

The research team co-led by bioengineers at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) presented their results in the August 17 issue of Nature.

Currently AI computing is both power-hungry and computationally expensive. Most AI applications on edge devices involve moving data from the devices to the cloud where the AI processes and analyzes it. Then the results are transferred back to the device. This is necessary because most edge devices are battery-powered and as a result only have a limited amount of power that can be dedicated to computing.

By reducing the power consumption needed for AI inference at the edge this NeuRRAM chip could lead to more robust smarter and accessible edge devices and smarter manufacturing. It could also lead to better data privacy because the transfer of data from devices to the cloud comes with increased security risks.

On AI chips moving data from memory to computing units is one major bottleneck.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the equivalent of doing an eight-hour commute for a two-hour work day‚Äù Wan said.

To solve this data transfer issue researchers used what is known as resistive random-access memory. This type of non-volatile memory allows for computation directly within memory rather than in separate computing units. RRAM and other emerging memory technologies used as synapse arrays for neuromorphic computing were pioneered in the lab of Philip Wong Wan‚Äôs advisor at Stanford and one of the main contributors to this work. Although computation with RRAM chips is not necessarily new generally it leads to a decrease in the accuracy of the computations performed on the chip and a lack of flexibility in the chip‚Äôs architecture.

‚ÄúCompute-in-memory has been common practice in neuromorphic engineering since it was introduced more than 30 years ago‚Äù Cauwenberghs said. ‚ÄúWhat is new with NeuRRAM is that the extreme efficiency now goes together with great flexibility for diverse AI applications with almost no loss in accuracy over standard digital general-purpose compute platforms.‚Äù

A carefully crafted methodology was key to the work with multiple levels of ‚Äúco-optimization‚Äù across the abstraction layers of hardware and software from the design of the chip to its configuration to run various AI tasks. Additionally the team made sure to account for various constraints that span from memory device physics to circuits and network architecture.

‚ÄúThis chip now provides us with a platform to address these problems across the stack from devices and circuits to algorithms‚Äù said Siddharth Joshi an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Notre Dame who started working on the project as a Ph.D. student and postdoctoral researcher in Cauwenberghs lab at UCSD.

Chip performance

Researchers measured the chip‚Äôs energy efficiency by a measure known as energy-delay product or EDP. EDP combines both the amount of energy consumed for every operation and the amount of time it takes to complete the operation. By this measure the NeuRRAM chip achieves 1.6 to 2.3 times lower EDP (lower is better) and 7 to 13 times higher computational density than state-of-the-art chips.

Engineers ran various AI tasks on the chip. It achieved 99% accuracy on a handwritten digit recognition task; 85.7% on an image classification task; and 84.7% on a Google speech command recognition task. In addition the chip also achieved a 70% reduction in image-reconstruction error on an image-recovery task. These results are comparable to existing digital chips that perform computation under the same bit-precision but with drastic savings in energy.

One key contribution of the paper the researchers point out is that all the results featured are obtained directly on the hardware. In many previous works of compute-in-memory chips AI benchmark results were often obtained partially by software simulation.

Next steps include improving architectures and circuits and scaling the design to more advanced technology nodes. Engineers also plan to tackle other applications such as spiking neural networks.

‚ÄúWe can do better at the device level improve circuit design to implement additional features and address diverse applications with our dynamic NeuRRAM platform‚Äù said Rajkumar Kubendran an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh who started work on the project while a Ph.D. student in Cauwenberghs‚Äô research group at UCSD.

In addition Wan is a founding member of a startup that works on productizing the compute-in-memory technology. ‚ÄúAs a researcher and an engineer my ambition is to bring research innovations from labs into practical use‚Äù Wan said.

New architecture

The key to NeuRRAM‚Äôs energy efficiency is an innovative method to sense output in memory. Conventional approaches use voltage as input and measure current as the result. But this leads to the need for more complex and more power-hungry circuits. In NeuRRAM the team engineered a neuron circuit that senses voltage and performs analog-to-digital conversion in an energy-efficient manner. This voltage-mode sensing can activate all the rows and all the columns of an RRAM array in a single computing cycle allowing higher parallelism.

In the NeuRRAM architecture CMOS neuron circuits are physically interleaved with RRAM weights. It differs from conventional designs where CMOS circuits are typically on the peripheral of RRAM weights. The neuron‚Äôs connections with the RRAM array can be configured to serve as either input or output of the neuron. This allows neural network inference in various data flow directions without incurring overheads in area or power consumption. This in turn makes the architecture easier to reconfigure.

To make sure that the accuracy of the AI computations can be preserved across various neural network architectures engineers developed a set of hardware algorithm co-optimization techniques. The techniques were verified on various neural networks including convolutional neural networks long short-term memory and restricted Boltzmann machines.

As a neuromorphic AI chip NeuroRRAM performs parallel distributed processing across 48 neurosynaptic cores. To simultaneously achieve high versatility and high efficiency NeuRRAM supports data-parallelism by mapping a layer in the neural network model onto multiple cores for parallel inference on multiple data. Also NeuRRAM offers model-parallelism by mapping different layers of a model onto different cores and performing inference in a pipelined fashion.

An international research team

The work is the result of an international team of researchers.

The UCSD team designed the CMOS circuits that implement the neural functions interfacing with the RRAM arrays to support the synaptic functions in the chip‚Äôs architecture for high efficiency and versatility. Wan working closely with the entire team implemented the design; characterized the chip; trained the AI models; and executed the experiments. Wan also developed a software toolchain that maps AI applications onto the chip.

The RRAM synapse array and its operating conditions were extensively characterized and optimized at Stanford University.

The RRAM array was fabricated and integrated onto CMOS at Tsinghua University.

The Team at Notre Dame contributed to both the design and architecture of the chip and the subsequent machine learning model design and training.

The research started as part of the National Science Foundation funded Expeditions in Computing project on Visual Cortex on Silicon at Penn State University with continued funding support from the Office of Naval Research Science of AI program the Semiconductor Research Corporation and DARPA JUMP program and Western Digital Corporation.

I compared the performance of the card reader 'SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD' that can draw out the performance of the ultra-high speed SD card by 100% with the card reader built into the notebook PC





The file sizes of photos and movies that can be taken with digital cameras are increasing year by year increasing the need for high-capacity and high-speed memory cards. However even if you prepare a high-speed memory card it is likely that you will not be able to work at the speed you want if the performance of the card reader is low. ' SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD ' which appeared from the long-established storage brand SanDisk can fully draw out the performance of high-speed SD cards and microSD cards so prepare a super high-speed SD card.  I compared the reading performance with the built-in SD card reader of the notebook PC used in the editorial department.

‚óÜ SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD read performance check

In order to verify the read performance of 'SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD' '

SanDisk 1TB Extreme PRO SDXC ' (maximum read speed 200MB/s) '' (maximum read speed 190MB/s)  '' (maximum read speed 190MB / s) is available.





Let's compare the reading performance by inserting the above three types of memory cards into the built-in SD card reader of the notebook PC '

VAIO SX12 ' and 'SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD'.





The execution result of the standard benchmark software '

CrystalDiskMark ' is as follows.When inserted into 'SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD' (left) it recorded a speed close to the maximum read speed of 189.59 MB / s but the read speed is half with the built-in SD card reader of the notebook PC (right) It dropped to 89.73MB/s nearby.





„ÉªSanDisk 256GB Extreme PLUS SDXC (maximum read speed 190MB/s)

The read speed with 'SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD' (left) is 186.12 MB / s and the read speed with the built-in SD card reader (right) is 90.05 MB / s. 'SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD' can draw out the speed according to the specifications of the SD card but the built-in SD card reader can only demonstrate less than half the performance.







„ÉªSanDisk 1TB Extreme microSDXC (maximum read speed 190MB / s)

The notebook PC used for comparison does not have a microSD card slot so I inserted it through the conversion adapter that came with the card. The measurement result is 184.96 MB / s for 'SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD' (left) and 89.41 MB / s for the built-in SD card reader (right). 'SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD' was able to bring out the performance according to the specifications in the same way with microSD.







Next in order to verify the file transfer speed in the actual usage environment save a 16.5 GB folder containing 2788 photos in 'SanDisk 1TB Extreme PRO SDXC' and use 'SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD' and the built-in SD card reader and measured the time it takes to copy data to the PC.







The measurement result is 106.74 seconds for 'SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD' and 209.87 seconds for the built-in SD card reader. 'SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD' was able to finish copying in half the time of the built-in SD card reader. Checking the transition of the data transfer speed during copying the built-in SD card reader (right) is only about half the maximum read speed of the SD card (200MB/s) of about 80MB/s but 'SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD' (left) was able to transfer data at a speed close to the maximum read speed of around 160 MB / s.







As mentioned above when using a high-speed memory card the card reader built into the PC or an external card reader with low performance may not be able to bring out the full performance of the memory card. In recent years it has become possible to easily shoot large-capacity movies with smartphones and action cameras so there are many opportunities to save large-capacity data on memory cards. There must be many people who have experienced feeling that it is slow. 'SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD' Highly recommended if you want to bring out the original performance of SD cards and microSD cards.

Its funding was a welcome development ‚Äî albeit one that was tinged by concerns over China‚Äôs rising influence. Western governments share these concerns and have since offered alternatives to the BRI. The PGII is arguably the most detailed of these initiatives but there are many questions about its viability.

It is unclear whether plans to mobilise private capital to fund infrastructure will succeed. A history of unfulfilled efforts also means that Western infrastructure initiatives have a credibility problem. Yet the West still intends to compete with China on infrastructure development. Developing countries should harness this competition by using rival offers to demand higher standards from partners to meet their needs.

The PGII offers an interesting value proposition for developing economies. Compared to the BRI‚Äôs general focus on hard infrastructure the PGII‚Äôs priority pillars include climate security digital connectivity gender equality and health security. These are areas in which Western companies may hold a comparative advantage over their Chinese counterparts particularly in providing clean energy solutions. They also align better with development needs like those articulated in ASEAN‚Äôs call for better health systems inclusive digital transformation and sustainable energy as part of the COVID-19 Comprehensive Recovery Framework in 2020.

The G7‚Äôs pledge to provide US$600 billion in infrastructure funding by mobilising private capital is notable as well. Insurance and pension funds are a relatively untapped source of funding for infrastructure projects and could help developing countries to close the infrastructure gap. The benefits of a US$40 million investment in Southeast Asian power networks for example would be magnified if the project could attain its goal of mobilising US$2 billion in private capital.

Concerns about the PGII‚Äôs viability are numerous. Its emphasis on gender equality may struggle to find roots in developing Asia. And despite the United States having a long history of mobilising private capital under the Overseas Private Investment Corporation the risks associated with infrastructure projects have traditionally made them very unpopular with private investors.

Yet the PGII‚Äôs credibility problem is arguably more serious. This is not so much the result of geopolitics as it is the poor track record of non-Chinese infrastructure initiatives. With the exception of Japan‚Äôs Partnership for Quality Infrastructure initiatives such as the European Union Connectivity Strategy for Europe and Asia and the EU‚ÄìIndia Connectivity Partnership seem to have stagnated or been unceremoniously repackaged under new titles.

The difference in the visibility of the BRI and Western initiatives is also striking. China has dozens of noteworthy projects across Southeast Asia from high-speed railways to hydropower plants while most casual observers would be hard-pressed to name more than one Western project in the region.

There is no consensus on whether the PGII will succeed or fail. But despite unsurprisingly low expectations about the initiative developing Asia should keep an eye on the PGII. The presence of two viable financing models will allow recipient countries to bargain for better deals.

Developing countries are said to prefer the looser requirements of BRI projects but their governments have shown independent judgement in choosing non-Chinese infrastructure partners or renegotiating existing agreements. Vietnam and Indonesia have engaged Japan and China on separate railway projects while leaders from the Philippines and Malaysia have pushed to renegotiate loan agreements with Beijing.

Meanwhile Western governments are likely to ramp up criticism of the BRI regardless of what happens with the PGII particularly over governance scandals and the rising indebtedness of countries such as Laos. China denies these claims but remains sensitive about its international image taking steps to address some of its overseas investment practices as early as 2017.

During a BRI conference in 2019 Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to rein in corruption and boost transparency around the BRI. He then publicly announced in September 2021 that China would ‚Äònot build new coal-fired power projects abroad‚Äô. Loud complaints from developing economies about governance problems could compel Beijing to hasten its reform efforts some of which remain unfulfilled.

Developing countries have a golden opportunity to take advantage of the rivalry between Western and non-Western initiatives. Even if they intend on rejecting Western proposals recipient governments can use them as leverage to hold China to its reform promises. It will take deft leadership to avoid the temptation of the cheapest offer ‚Äî but persevering could bring developing Asia one step closer to bridging its infrastructure gap in a sustainable fashion.

One episode featured a heated phone call with his girlfriend who wanted to come home as the companies weren‚Äôt doing well. Following the episode she clarified the call and blamed production for editing things out.

Leo Temory‚Äôs girlfriend called him about his businesses during ‚ÄòThe Challenge: USA‚Äô episode 7

During the August 18 episode of The Challenge: USA Leo Temory had a heated phone call with his girlfriend. Apparently she took care of his businesses while he was competing but issues caused them to lose money every day totaling over $40000 at the time.

His girlfriend was upset as she felt he should be home running the day-to-day operations and seemingly wanted him to quit to return and take care of things. Therefore Leo packed his bags and got ready to leave until his teammate Alyssa Lopez convinced him to stay as his exit might affect her spot in the game.

Don't sleep on Sarah and Leo now! They got voted in and fully DOMINATED this elimination. ? #TheChallengeUSA pic.twitter.com/VgxLqWvuwf ‚Äî The Challenge (@TheChallenge) August 5 2022

Following the episode his girlfriend Alia posted a screenshot of a message written in her Notes app to her Instagram story. She claimed the viewers don‚Äôt know what happened ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù noting that ‚Äúuncommon issues‚Äù with the businesses were happening at the time.

Additionally she accused production of preventing Leo from having ‚Äúbusiness calls that they already agreed on.‚Äù His girlfriend admitted ‚Äúwe were both overwhelmed‚Äù as she also had a full-time job. Alia claimed the show cut and edited the scenes pointing out that their phone call and his attempt to leave happened on different days. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt even wearing the same outfit‚Äù she noted.

Leo has won two eliminations during ‚ÄòThe Challenge: USA‚Äô

The 36-year-old Los Angeles native entered The Challenge: USA alongside only three others representing The Amazing Race franchise including runner-up Cayla Lee and winner James Wallington.

They were immediate targets but Leo remained safe. He had a history of people not wanting to team up with him due to his lack of focus and Sarah Lacina was no different.

However the two had to work together during episode 5 when they were blindsided into elimination as winning couple Tyson Apostol and Cashay Proudfoot wanted to take a shot at the Survivor champ. They came out on top eliminating Azah Awasum and Cinco Holland Jr.

He remained safe until a couple of episodes later when he and Alyssa finished at the bottom earning a spot in the elimination round. The team sent Kyland Young and Kyra Green home and stole the money in their bank account bringing Leo up to $9000 the fourth most remaining contestant.

Leo initially appeared on ‚ÄòThe Amazing Race‚Äô

In 2013 Leo and his cousin Jamal Zadran the ‚ÄúAfghanimals‚Äù competed on The Amazing Race 23 where they immediately made their mark with their boisterous personalities.

The team was U-Turned twice but survived the first team to do so ultimately placing fourth. They returned for the following season All-Stars where they focused more on their social game.

Leo and Jamal are turning this up! ?? #AmazingRace pic.twitter.com/9fmqLNQDag ‚Äî The Amazing Race (@AmazingRaceCBS) June 27 2019

Although it worked as they avoided getting U-Turned the duo placed fourth again. The cousins returned for a third and likely final time in 2019 for The Amazing Race 31 where they implemented their initial strategy.

Even though they struggled throughout the season the duo finished with their placement in third. Leo‚Äôs appearance on CBS‚Äô reality competition show is his first since his time on The Amazing Race.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vZ3VhcmRpYW4ubmcvc2F0dXJkYXktbWFnYXppbmUvaS1wcm9taXNlZC1teS1tb3RoZXItdGhhdC1pbGwtYmVjb21lLXN1Y2Nlc3NmdWwtYW5kLWhlbHAtb3RoZXJzLWxpbnVzLXdpbGxpYW1zLWlmZWppa2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I promised my mother that I'll become successful and help others ‚Äì Linus Williams Ifejika,"Blord Group chairman Linus Williams Ifejika has disclosed the motivating factor behind his tireless drive for success.

Linus Williams Ifejika symbolises the many determined Nigerian youths who against all odds have continued to strive in an environment that is not built to support their aspirations.

The Blord Group comprises a cryptocurrency trading company BLord Luxury Store BLord Autoz and a real estate environment was first renowned as the number one bitcoin vendor in Nigeria with the founder seeing ahead many years ago what has brought the others into the business today.

Everything Linus Williams Ifejika who is also known as Blord has touched turned to gold. He has built his business empire from nothing particularly the bitcoin outfit which has become one of the most sought-after in Nigeria and Africa.

Blord‚Äôs diversification into other sectors is a stroke of genius. He recently made a grand entrance into the property business one of the fast-growing industries in Nigeria.

In a recent interview Blord revealed that a promise he made to his mother years ago is the reason he has continued to push for success.

‚ÄúI promised my mother that I will work hard and be successful. She is the only one I am out to impress‚Äù Blord said.

On diversification the businessman dropped a hint that the company will yet test the waters in other businesses.

‚ÄúThe Blord Group will be expanding into various business areas. Presently we are one of the biggest bitcoin trading companies in Nigeria and Africa. We have a gadget store B-lord Luxury Store and we have added B-Lord Real Estate‚Äù Blord stressed.

Kendrick Lamar offered up a highly artful visually stunning 100-minute performance at Xcel Energy Center one that somehow combined modern dance psychotherapy a ventriloquist dummy and even COVID testing ‚Äî all without missing a beat.

The truly clever shadowy stage production was no indicator the music itself lacked wow value. Simply put: The only rapper to win a Pulitzer Prize once again lived up to the hype as the greatest in his field at the moment.

Coming a month into the tour behind his fifth album ""Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers"" Saturday's show was Lamar's second time packing St. Paul hockey's arena in the decade since his hometown heroes Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg propped him up as Los Angeles' new rap king.

Unlike his appearance with those two mentors in the Super Bowl Halftime Show back in February though Saturday's stage production was far from super elaborate. Black and white imagery and light and dark tones battled each other throughout the concert much like the inner demons that Lamar openly wrestles with on the new record.

The 35-year-old rapper took the stage to the tune of ""United in Grief"" carrying a dummy version of himself as if struggling to offer up his own real voice. He found it soon enough though.

A therapist's voice ‚Äî recorded by Dame Helen Mirren ‚Äî popped in here and there over the speakers to offer psychoanalytical feedback to the star after he hid behind a proverbial mask in ""N95"" or wrestled with his fast-rising fame in ""Rich Spirit.""

The rest of the staging matched that stark direct vibe. Instead of fly-girl dancers a dozen men and women in black and white suits gracefully moved in and out of dimmed white stage lighting. And instead of hyperactively running up and down the runway ‚Äî which stretched more than halfway across the arena floor ‚Äî Lamar often moved slowly and with purpose. Sometimes he didn't even move at all.

One of the most stirring moments actually found him sitting on a plain chair in the center of the blank stage delivering ""Father Time"" crouched over like a doctor delivering a baby. And what delivery too!

During ""Mirror"" Lamar didn't have any other choice but to mostly stand still. He performed it confined inside a box-shaped hospital decontamination bubble as he lamented about the COVID pandemic ""Sorry I didn't save the world my friend I was too busy building my redemp.""

Another simple but impactful effect played out well in ""M.A.A.D. City"" when the dancers surrounded the rapper with bright flashlights looking like a police caravan closing in on him. Most clever of all in the slow-building ""Count Me Out"" Lamar bobbed and swayed in unison to a giant shadow version of himself reflected on a curtain; the shadow however had arrows shot into his back.

Saturday's set list was stuffed with nearly all the tracks from the new album. The 14000 or so fans responded to the new material with ample excitement and even sang along to some of the deeper cuts. They also turned it on for ""Family Ties"" which brought opener Baby Keem back to the stage.

Based on the rabid reaction to ""King Kunta"" ""Humble"" and ""Backseat Freestyle"" though the crowd would have appreciated more of Lamar's old stuff. You could hear genuine groans when he cut off ""Loyalty"" and ""Swimming Pools (Drank)"" after only one verse each blending them into a medley with ""Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe.""

This one clearly wasn't meant to be a greatest-hits affair though. That made it all the more impressive. It should go down as one of the greatest hip-hop tours of all time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndjdHJpYi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9pbnZlc3RpbmctaW4tdHJhbnNtaXNzaW9uLWEtZ29vZC10aGluZy1mb3Itd2lsbG1hci1tdW5pY2lwYWwtdXRpbGl0aWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investing in transmission a good thing for Willmar Municipal Utilities,"WiLLMAR ‚Äî Investing in transmission has been a major focus of Willmar Municipal Utilities for the past several years and that was made clear during a recent tour for the Municipal Utilities Commission on Aug. 8.

‚ÄúAt the utility whenever we get a chance to invest in transmission we like to invest into transmission‚Äù Harren said noting that there is a guaranteed 10-11% return on investment for transmission. ‚ÄúWe made a number of investments over the years that provide additional reliability additional capacity to Willmar in addition to the return on investment that you are guaranteed through the (public utility commission‚Äôs) approval.‚Äù

Electric transmission infrastructure is regulated in order to prevent utilities from overbuilding infrastructure that is not needed according to Willmar Municipal Utilities electrical engineer Jeron Smith.

Willmar Municipal Utilities is a member of Missouri River Energy Services which generally conducts the transmission planning studies needed to gain permission from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator to build additional transmission facilities.

Willmar Municipal Utilities also partners with Great River Energy because it owns a significant amount of transmission in the southwest portion of Minnesota Smith noted. WMU has been doing transmission planning studies related to the closure in 2018 of a bioenergy plant in Benson owned by Xcel Energy according to Smith.

Smith explained that the closing of the plant created a ‚Äúcavity‚Äù in this area which led to the construction of the Priam substation and upgrades to the Willmar substation.

The construction of the Priam substation in 2018 was a $5 million to $6 million investment and the current expansion of the Priam substation is a $1.2 million investment. The expansion taking place at the Willmar substation is an $8.3 million investment according to Smith.

One setback of the Willmar substation project is that a couple of key electrical components needed for the new control building are not yet delivered due to supply chain issues. This is slowing down the testing process needed to get the substation addition up and running according to Smith.

The next major investment in transmission is expected to be $2 million to $4 million in 2027 if the transmission planning study can be completed by then and MISO supports the upgrade according to Harren.

Willmar Municipal Utilities will either replace the older Toshiba transformer at the Willmar substation or add a second transformer at the Priam substation according to Smith.

Expansion at the Priam substation included installing three additional breakers and equipment to facilitate a new transmission line that will connect to and help energize a portion of the Willmar substation Smith said. He noted an advantage of the Priam substation is its proximity to transmission lines which cost $1 million per mile to build.

Willmar Municipal Utilities is constructing a new substation next to the downtown Willmar Power Plant which will be demolished once the substation is energized according to Smith. It is hoped the $5.3 million substation will be in service in November.

However this being the most recent substation project it is being most affected by supply chain issues Smith said. The control building for the substation has already been delayed more than a month but Willmar Municipal Utilities has been informed that it will arrive in November.

If the project is not complete and the power plant substation cannot be energized by November it will delay the demolition of the power plant Smith noted.

The demolition of the power plant is currently out to bid and the deadline has been extended to allow contractors additional time to submit bids according to facilities and maintenance supervisor Kevin Marti.

‚ÄúIt is an incredibly tight site. It will be really interesting to see how they are going to take the plant down and clean it up. It‚Äôs like trying to put a size 10 foot in an 8 shoe. It‚Äôs challenging‚Äù Marti said.

He noted that scrap metal prices are currently elevated which should help lower the cost of the demolition of the plant. However there is a lot of concrete and other materials that need to be removed from the plant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmloZWFydC5jb20vYWx0ZXJuYXRlL2FtcC8yMDIyLTA4LTIwLW1pY2hhZWwtYnVibC13aWZlLWx1aXNhbmEtbG9waWxhdG8td2VsY29tZS1mb3VydGgtYmFieS_SAWdodHRwczovL3d3dy5paGVhcnQuY29tL2FsdGVybmF0ZS9hbXAvMjAyMi0wOC0yMC1taWNoYWVsLWJ1Ymwtd2lmZS1sdWlzYW5hLWxvcGlsYXRvLXdlbGNvbWUtZm91cnRoLWJhYnkv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael Bubl√© & Wife Luisana Lopilato Welcome Fourth Baby,"Michael Buble and wife Luisana Lopilato have welcomed their fourth baby.

A big crowd turned up to the Katanning Leisure Centre on August 19 to see what was understood to be WA‚Äôs second dog auction following a similar event 10 years ago at the same venue.

Auction co-ordinator and Williams farmer Jim Harradine said it was hoped the sale would find success and start up an annual event which would raise awareness of the benefits of owning a working dog.

‚ÄúThe revenues raised at regular working dog auctions would help increase the quality of dogs bred in WA‚Äù he said.

Mr Carr was thrilled when his three-year-old Kelpie named Tanner topped the sale.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very excited about the future ‚Äî this will kickstart my Kelpie stud breeding‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúTanner was my first Kelpie pup and was sired by my main working dog Ida Vale Cruiser to an outside bitch and I had first pick of the litter.

‚ÄúShe trained up well and worked with me at the Kingston Rest feedlot but she needs a new challenge now.‚Äù

Tanner was bought by Kojonup farmer and prominent WA Meat Marketing Co-operative chairman Craig Heggaton who runs four sheep studs.

‚ÄúA good working dog is worth its weight in gold‚Äù he said.

By invitation established South Australian working dog breeder Peter Carr of Barrkel Peters Kelpie stud in Pinaroo brought four dogs to the sale selling to a top of $11700 through AuctionsPlus.

‚ÄúA working dog can do the work of 10 people‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI sell between 30 and 40 dogs every year the demand is that good.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve sold to a top of $21000.‚Äù

Mr Harradine said he was very pleased with the sale result with 11 of the 18 dogs on offer selling from $1000-$15900 to average $5093/head.

‚ÄúWe were hoping to sell for reasonable prices to get as many dogs new homes as possible‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI think people will walk away with an understanding of what a good working dog is worth.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,
